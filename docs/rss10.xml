&lt;p&gt;We often think of sleep as a chance to switch off from the outside world, leaving us blissfully ignorant of anything going on around us. But neuroscience research has shown this is a fantasy – we still monitor the environment and respond to particular sounds while we’re sleeping (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/17/eyes-shut-mind-open-what-your-brain-pays-attention-to-while-youre-sleeping/&quot;&gt;at least in some stages of sleep&lt;/a&gt;) – a fact that will be unsurprising to anyone who has woken up after hearing someone say their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a study published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt; has revealed more about the brain’s surprisingly sophisticated levels of engagement with the outside world during sleep. Not only does the sleeping brain respond to certain words or sounds – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0502-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_cognitive-neuroscience&quot;&gt;it can even select between competing signals&lt;/a&gt;, prioritising the one that is more informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36908&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons it’s a challenge for researchers to figure out what people are paying attention to while they’re asleep. Guillaume Legendre at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and his colleagues overcame this problem by looking at the changing patterns of their volunteers’ brainwaves using EEG (electroencephalography, which uses scalp electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 24 French participants to complete a series of listening tasks while awake and asleep. In the initial part of the experiment, the team recorded the participants’ EEG signal while they listened to one-minute-long excerpts of speech. Some of these excerpts were taken from real news reports, stories, movies, and Wikipedia entries. Others were from passages of so-called “Jabberwocky” text, which had normal sentence structure but with content that was gibberish (as in Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem of the same name: “’Twas brillig and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe..”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then trained a computer algorithm to learn how the participants’ brainwaves varied according to the audio they’d heard. After this training, the researchers could present the algorithm with a participant’s brainwave recording and it could reconstruct the audio signal that they’d been listening to at the time.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, to see how the brain responded to two competing inputs, the researchers analysed the EEG brainwave data when participants heard both the real and nonsense texts simultaneously, one playing in each ear (this started while they were awake and were focused on the meaningful speech, and it continued after they fell asleep).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ computer algorithm was able to reconstruct both of the audio signals from the participants’ brainwaves, suggesting that they were processing both forms of speech even while asleep. And crucially, during both wakefulness and sleep, the reconstruction was better for the signal from the meaningful text than the nonsense text, suggesting that the brain had been “amplifying” the meaningful story in some way so that it left clearer traces in the EEG data.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When participants were awake, 60.6 per cent of trials were reconstructed better for the meaningful text, while this number decreased to 52.4 per cent of sleep trials. But the smaller amplification effect during sleep was still significantly higher than the 50 per cent that would be expected by chance had the brain no longer been able to prioritise the meaningful speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several factors appeared to influence whether or not the EEG signal for meaningful stories was amplified during sleep. Depth of sleep was important: meaningful stories were only amplified during light sleep (stage 2) but not deep sleep (stage 3). And the effect appeared only temporary, occurring during the first 30 seconds of a story, but not the last 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers write that their experiment provides evidence that people can selectively process meaningful or important information during sleep – a ninja-like ability which could have evolutionary advantages. “In an ever-changing environment, the ability to process relevant signals during light sleep offers substantial benefits,” they write. “In particular, it would allow signalling the presence of events, necessitating a rapid reversal towards wakefulness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the bias towards processing the meaningful stories during sleep appeared very small, so it remains unclear how important it would be in a real-world environment. And because participants had been told to pay attention to the meaningful story, it may be that the amplification effect was driven “top-down” by their attention rather than by the meaningfulness of the stimulus &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the study makes it clear that the brain’s engagement with the outside world during sleep is far more complex than we often recognise.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0502-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_cognitive-neuroscience&quot;&gt;Sleepers track informative speech in a multitalker environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Diversity trainings are big business. In the United States, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/5118035/diversity-training-infuriates-men-fails-women/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;companies spend about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;£&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;6.1 billion per year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, by one estimate, on programmes geared at making companies more inclusive and welcoming to members of often-underrepresented groups (British numbers aren’t easy to come by, but according to one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/experts/research/businesses-expect-increase-investment-diversity&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, over a third of recruiters are planning to increase their investment in diversity initiatives).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, there’s little evidence-backed consensus about which sorts of diversity programmes work, and why, and there have been long-standing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in some quarters that these programmes don’t do much at all, or that they could actually be harmful. In part because of this dearth of evidence, the market for pro-diversity interventions is a bit of a Wild West with regard to quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1816076116&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PNAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a prominent team of researchers, including Katherine Milkman, Angela Duckworth, and Adam Grant of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, partnered with a large global organisation to measure the real-world impact of the researchers’ own anti-bias intervention, designed principally to “promote inclusive attitudes and behaviors toward women, whereas a secondary focus was to promote the inclusion of other underrepresented groups (e.g., racial minorities).” The results were mixed at best – and unfortunately there are good reasons to be sceptical that even the more positive results are as positive as they seem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36889&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The company in question emailed 10,983 employees, inviting them to “complete a new inclusive leadership workplace training,” as the researchers sum it up. Out of those, 3,016 employees, 38.5 per cent of them American, answered the call and were assigned, in thirds, either to one of two online treatment groups or to a control group. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“In the gender-bias and general-bias trainings,” write the researchers, “participants learned about the psychological processes that underlie stereotyping and research that shows how stereotyping can result in bias and inequity in the workplace, completed and received feedback on an Implicit Association Test assessing their associations between gender and career-oriented words, and learned about strategies to overcome stereotyping in the workplace.” There was little difference between the so-called gender-bias and general-bias trainings, except for minor points of emphasis, and the researchers ended up collapsing them into one training condition, comparing the results to those in a control group who received a “stylistically similar training, but [with a focus on] psychological safety and active listening rather than stereotyping.” On average, the bias training took 68 minutes to complete, and was evaluated on the basis of responses to an attitudes questionnaire and real-world behavioural data taken up to 20 weeks post-intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The key chart summarising all the researchers’ findings is shown at the top of this post. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One thing that immediately jumps out is that the top row, which deals with attitudes, shows more impressive results than the bottom row, which deals with actual behavior (though even the top-row results are modest in terms of the size of their effect). But in looking at the attitudinal measures the researchers used, critical readers might fairly wonder whether they’re really measuring what they are supposed to be measuring – i.e. support for women in the workplace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For example, the “attitudinal support for women” score was drawn from levels of (dis)agreement with items like “Discrimination against women is no longer a problem” and “Society has reached the point where women and men have equal opportunities for achievement.” But arguably, whether an individual believes equality has already been accomplished is different from whether they believe that women should be fully supported in the workplace. Someone can believe that discrimination against women is no longer a problem but still believe they should be treated in exactly the same way as men. These questionnaire statements seem to be more geared at measuring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;political liberalism or conservatism with regard to gender issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; than misogynist attitudes directly. So the risk, then, is that the training successfully increases political liberalism (to a modest degree), but it’s not possible to tell from the questionnaire items whether it alters the kind of attitudes that are likely to more directly underlie discriminatory behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Arguably, there is also a problem with the “gender-bias acknowledgment” result, which was based on those participants in the training group admitting (more than the control participants) to having gender biases more similar to the average person. This finding is complicated by the fact that the bias training involved taking the gender-bias Implicit Association Test (IAT). Setting aside the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;other well-documented problems with the IAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the gender IAT, in particular, has produced some strange results. As this chart from FiveThirtyEight &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-unconscious-sexism-could-help-explain-trumps-win/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;showed in 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the normal “pattern” of IATs relating to minority or marginalised groups – in which conservatives (and members of majority groups) tend to score higher for implicit bias toward such groups than liberals (and members of minority groups) – is more or less reversed when it comes to the gender-bias IAT:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bialik-gender-1.png&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-36891&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;36891&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;bialik-gender-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845?w=845&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845?w=258&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1150,1338&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/10/finally-some-research-into-whether-diversity-training-actually-works-unfortunately-its-not-very-promising/bialik-gender-1/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Specifically, results from the gender IAT suggest that women are more implicitly biased against women than men are, that this is the case at every point on the political spectrum, and that within many subgroups, political liberals are more biased against women than conservatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Setting aside these questionable patterns, a lot of people in the bias-training condition were likely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; they were biased by their IAT result. So when they subsequently filled out a questionnaire asking them to gauge their level of anti-woman bias, were they simply echoing what a dubious test told them? It certainly seems like a possibility, and if so, should that count as an ethical, successful educational intervention? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, the behavioral results (based on participants’ choices of who to mentor, which new hires to speak to, and colleagues’ excellence to recognise) were far less impressive than the attitudinal ones. A lot of the effects were clustered right around zero and/or differed greatly on the basis of sex or nationality (which isn’t a good sign for programmes that are designed to be delivered to large, diverse groups of employees). The biggest effect involved an email invitation, 14 weeks after follow-up, to talk on the phone with either a male or a female new hire. There was no overall effect, but among women only, those in the bias-training group were more likely, at a statistically significant level, than those in the control condition, to agree to talk to newly hired women than men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Where does all this leave us? It’s hard to say. The results definitely weren’t impressive, and the strongest came from questionable attitude measures and, potentially, participants’ responses to a controversial test of implicit bias. This outcome shouldn’t be too surprising: if you surveyed psychologists and asked them whether a single, 68-minute training could generate sizable behavioural effects weeks and months later, most would probably tell you no. Behaviour change is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;hard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Plus, even the modest results seen here were for employees who volunteered to take part, rather than a random sample. Yet diversity trainings, at their best, will have a positive effect on the general population of a company or institution, not just those who express a desire to take part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That said, setting aside quibbles with this particular evaluation and programme, this study is laudable for showing exactly how diversity programmes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; be evaluated: with an eye toward behavioural outcomes measured a significant period of time after the programme itself is delivered. Until there are more studies like this one, those who want to use diversity training to make companies and other institutions more welcoming have no option but to feel around in the dark for what works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For any regular at the gym, there’s a noticeable &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/do-people-keep-new-years-resolution-fitness-weight-loss-data/579388/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;phenomenon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; around the beginning of the year: an influx of new members followed by a quick drop-off just a few weeks later. Exercising more is a perennially common New Year’s resolution, but it can be difficult to stick with. For older adults, regular exercise has multiple benefits, including helping to maintain muscle strength, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, and aiding the management of depression. But just as with those new gym members, older adults too face challenges starting and staying with an exercise routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In this study, Reitlo et al. analyzed nearly 70,000 exercise logs from one year of the Generation 100 study, which examined the effects of exercise on mortality in older adults in Norway, over a five-year period. The participants were prescribed either two weekly sessions of moderate-intensity training (MCT) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and asked to log their exercise activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Overall, walking was the most popular activity in both groups, followed by cycling, then combined endurance and resistance training. Exercising outdoors proved to be the most common setting for activity in both groups, even in the colder months, while exercising at home was the least common. Importantly, they found that the participants maintained their exercise routines regardless of the intensity, which can vary among different individual levels of fitness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers also noticed some differences between men and women. For example, women exercised with others more often than men, who completed more sessions alone. In the MCT group, men exercised outdoors more frequently than women, but in the HIIT group, the opposite was true. The researchers suggest that these differences should be taken into account to effectively design exercise programs for older adults. As the world’s older population continues to grow, it is essential to understand how to best promote physical activity and keep the aging population healthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0867-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The effects of pet ownership on health in older adults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10965 alignright&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/walk-1385880__340-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;It has been well-demonstrated that owning a pet, especially a dog, is associated with better health. The reasons for this effect are less well understood, and it has even been shown that pets have the opposite effect in older adults. Therefore, the authors of this study set out to measure the effect of pet ownership on particular aspects of health – specifically physical activity, sleep, mental health, and general physical health – in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors Mein and Grant used data from a large study of older adults in London to examine the associations between pet ownership and the factors above, as well as how these were influenced by neighborhood perceptions and social isolation. They found that pet owners had similar overall health to non-owners but had more social activities, less trouble falling asleep, and better perceptions of their neighborhoods. These associations were stronger in dog owners than other pet owners. While this does not definitively answer all of the open questions about how pet ownership influences (or is influenced by) health, it does suggest that walking around the neighborhood with a dog has a positive effect on health and well-being in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0823-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do we know about frailty in emergency and hospital settings?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As populations around the world age, new challenges are faced in caring for older adults. One such challenge is understanding how age affects vulnerability to disease, falls, and other negative outcomes, and how this vulnerability varies between individuals of similar age. The concept of ‘frailty’ has been developed to describe and measure increased vulnerability among older adults. Identifying ‘frail’ individuals can allow for personalization of care to avoid changes or stressors that would affect them more negatively than a non-frail individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous instruments have been developed to measure frailty in a variety of settings, each with its own advantages and limitations. Associate Editor Olga Theou and colleagues conducted this scoping review to explore the literature around frailty in emergency and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The found that most studies included in the review used the term ‘frail’ as a subjective description rather than as an objectively measured characteristic. However, in those studies that did use established frailty measures, they found that frailty was generally a good predictor of negative outcomes, including death and institutionalization. These results point to the need to further develop the concept of ‘frailty’ as an objectively measured characteristic, to measure it in acute care settings, and to use the knowledge to improve care for frail older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0910-4&quot;&gt;Should older adults stop driving? Who decides?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10964 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/vintage-car-1149230__340-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In some countries, driving remains the most common form of transportation for older adults and can provide both independence and higher quality of life. However, driving can become more difficult as one ages, which causes older drivers to reduce the amount they drive or stop driving altogether. This process of driving cessation can happen for a number of reasons, from impaired vision or cognitive abilities to low income or advice from a family member. In this study by Piersma et al., 172 participants with cognitive impairment completed fitness-to-drive assessments, were given advice about their driving, then were asked seven months later if they followed that advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers found that most of the participants followed the recommendations given to either continue driving, take driving lessons, or cease driving.  In total, 104 (~60%) of the participants had continued to drive at the time of the follow-up; of these, 13 were given the initial recommendation to cease driving. The remaining 68 participants had stopped driving at follow-up and reported increases in cycling and use of public transportation, although the percentages of overall usage of alternate forms of transportation were actually lower than those of the current drivers at follow-up.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For participants who ceased driving, the most common reason was that they were following a recommendation, mostly from the driving fitness assessment, but many cited advice from a family member or authority figure. Cognitive impairment reduces one’s ability to drive safely, but drivers still can be reluctant to give up driving. The authors suggest that clinicians may want to consider referring patients with cognitive impairment to take a fitness-to-drive assessment, as the patient would be likely to heed the advice given. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, it is difficult to imagine what it must be like to be a synesthete – that is, someone who experiences a crossing over of their senses, such as seeing sounds as colours, or perceiving shapes as having tastes. However, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018304410?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Conscientiousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, it is actually relatively easy for people with normal perception to have a synesthetic experience (of the sound-to-vision variety). It merely takes a few minutes of visual deprivation, followed by a visual imagery task. The findings are not merely intriguing – and a fun idea for a psychology class experiment – they also have a bearing on the main theories for how synesthesia occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36857&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three studies, involving dozens of non-synesthetic undergrad students, the University of Michigan psychologists Anupama Nair and David Brang asked their volunteers to sit with their eyes closed in a completely darkened room for five minutes. After this, the imagery task began, which was almost identical through the three studies: dozens of times the students heard one of four words followed by a letter, such as “symmetrical T” or “curve A”, and their job was to visualise the letter and judge whether it had the mentioned feature (so, in the previous examples, whether “T” is symmetrical and whether  “A” contains any curves). The other two feature words used in the task were “diagonal” and “closed”, referring to whether the letter had a diagonal line in it or an entirely enclosed feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the darkness was to remove competing visual perceptions, while the idea of the imagery task was simply to raise the activity levels within the visual cortex (visual imagery is known to recruit brain areas that overlap with those involved in visual perception).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key element of the task was that the researchers played occasional, unpredictably timed beeps throughout the task, to see if these induced a visual experience in their participants. Meanwhile, for the duration of the task, the participants were asked to press a button to indicate any instance in which a sound prompted them to have a visual experience in the darkness. At debriefing later, they were asked to provide more details about any visual experiences they’d had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, across the three studies, nearly 60 per cent of the participants reported at least one instance of experiencing a sound-induced visual sensation in the darkness, including: “colorful small circles, amorphous blobs, scintillation [flash or sparkles of light], extrusion [like visual pulsing or eruptions], and movement”. These experiences were more common on trials of the task in which a beep occurred, although they were sometimes induced merely by the task words. Louder beeps more often induced visual experiences than quieter beeps, and usually the visual sensations were perceived as occurring on the same side of space as where the beep came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well-established that there is a lot of cross-wiring and cross-talk between the senses even in non-synesthetes and Nair and Brang said their findings, showing how quickly and easily synesthetic experiences can be induced in people with normal perception, are more consistent with the “disinhibited-feedback model” of synesthesia, which “proposes that synesthesia emerges when the balance of activity across the senses has been altered to allow one sensory modality the ability to exert stronger modulatory effects onto another sensory modality”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new findings are less consistent with the “cross-activation model”, which states that synesthesia emerges through the development, over many years, of atypical connections between sensory areas in people with the condition. The researchers acknowledge, however, that both mechanisms could contribute to the emergence of the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obvious criticism of the findings is that the participants may have been saying what they thought the researchers wanted to hear – indeed, the researchers did tell them at the start that they might experience visual sensations during the task. However, Nair and Brang think it unlikely that their participants were fabricating their experiences, not least because of the systematic patterns in the results (such as the visual perceptions occurring more often for louder beeps, and on the same side of space as the beeps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, these results demonstrate that mild visual deprivation facilitates auditory-visual percepts,” the researchers concluded, “indicating a higher prevalence of synesthesia-like experiences in the general population and a novel method to study both the relationship between synesthesia and normal multi-sensory processes and the experience of visual hallucinations in clinical populations.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Should I, or should I not? The ‘tricky business’ about healthcare decision making</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/09/should-i-or-should-i-not-the-tricky-business-about-healthcare-decision-making/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Womens-Health-HERO-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often put a lot of effort into making important decisions for our lives. We ponder things like: &lt;em&gt;“Should I apply for this new job?”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Should I buy this car?”&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe even &lt;em&gt;“Where should we go for our next holiday?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often spend lots of time gathering information on our options. We seek advice from loved ones, ‘sleep on it,’ and weigh up the pros and cons of each option to find out what is the right decision for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, many of us don’t put the same effort into making decisions regarding our healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many patients can feel overwhelmed when presented with information by their healthcare provider. Some patients report that there was not enough or too much information or that the information given to them was just not applicable to their situation. All of a sudden, making a decision – something we do hundreds of times a day – becomes ‘tricky business.’&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10928 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/decision-making-300x196.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of shared decision making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more decisions in healthcare are becoming what researchers call ‘preference-sensitive.’ This means that there is no single best option from a medical point of view. Each option has different pros and cons which patients may value differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it has been argued that patients should be involved in decision making regarding their care, to the extent they desire. For example, the slogan “Nothing about me without me” has been on many activists’ lips. The catchphrase was adopted by participants from 29 countries at a 1998 Salzburg global seminar. The seminar aimed to develop ideas regarding how to improve the quality of healthcare by involving patients. Numerous initiatives have been founded globally to support this idea of shared decision making. Researchers, patient advocates, and policy makers all over the world have been trying for decades to improve patient involvement in healthcare decision making. Despite these efforts, researchers still argue about how to best help patients make decisions regarding their care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandy has to make a difficult healthcare decision …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To picture this a bit better, I’d like to introduce to you Sandy. Sandy is 40 years old and has two children. Her mother died of ovarian cancer and her doctor told her that she has an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. She is offered to have her healthy ovaries removed to reduce her cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy fears her risk of ovarian cancer, as she knows that ovarian cancer is often detected at a late stage and survival rates are low. Her vivid memories of the way her mother suffered from this dreadful disease contribute to her fear of developing cancer herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, we can help patients manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having the surgery is likely to reduce her cancer risk, it does come with many side-effects – including surgical complications, such as bleeding or infections, and early menopause with its associated symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, risk of cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, or hip fracture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy also wonders whether she will still feel like a woman if she has her ovaries removed or whether her sexuality may be affected. She is concerned that the long-term effects of the surgery could impact her relationship and intimacy with her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what to do? Sandy speaks to her doctor who gives her numerous facts and figures. However, she is the one who ultimately has to decide whether to undergo the surgery or not. She feels overwhelmed and wishes there was more support with making this decision that will ultimately affect her life and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to help patients like Sandy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We interviewed women, like Sandy, who had to decide whether to remove their healthy ovaries to reduce their risk of developing cancer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0673-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In this paper&lt;/a&gt;, we report on how and why these women made their decision. We use a theoretical framework to help guide our research and develop suggestions for how we could better assist women with making difficult healthcare decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also look at how women use different strategies such as statistical information, ‘gut feeling,’ and their own experiences to decide what is best for them. We explore what they are struggling with most and how doctor-patient communication in this area could be improved. By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, this paper provides an important step towards helping people like Sandy manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political partisanship can be a major driving force behind many thoughts and behaviours, affecting obvious things like who to vote for, but also more tangential outcomes, such as how you &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/&quot;&gt;interpret scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; (liberals and conservatives alike tend to see evidence as more credible when it supports their ideological viewpoint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the situation is more complicated than that, as people’s actions are not always consistent with their political identity. What determines why &lt;a href=&quot;https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2016&quot;&gt;about 8 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, for example, rather than Donald Trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300034&quot;&gt;paper published recently in &lt;i&gt;Cognition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the answer may lie in how central an individual’s political affiliation is in the tangled web of features that make up their self-concept. A person’s identity contains a range of features, from characteristics like gender and age to political beliefs and moral principles. One feature can be caused by another: for example, someone might believe that they are an honest person as a direct result of the fact that they are also Christian. Previous research has suggested that the more “causally central” a feature is – that is, the more of these kinds of links that it has – the more fundamental it is to a person’s identity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Chen at London Business School and Oleg Urminsky at the University of Chicago wondered whether a person may be more likely to act in ways consistent with their political beliefs if they see their political identity as “causally central” to their self-concept, and they investigated this in an American and then a British context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36872&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair first gave 243 American participants an online survey designed to measure aspects of their self-identity on the day before the 2016 presidential elections, including questions about their demographics and their political views, such as which political party they were affiliated with and their position on various issues like gun control and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants then answered a series of questions about how these various features of their identity related to each other – for example whether “being a Republican” or “being male” had an influence on other aspects of their personal identity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They repeated this process for each of the 20 features, providing a complete map of which bits of self-identity they felt were causally related. Finally, the day after the election, participants were asked which candidate they voted for, and how much they approved of the candidate their party had nominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, 89 per cent of Democrats and 71 per cent of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, respectively. But the association between political affiliation and voting behaviour was not uniform: participants were more likely to have voted for their own party’s candidate if they saw their politics as more causally central to their self-concept.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this association held even when the researchers took into account how satisfied participants were with their own party’s candidate. “This result suggests that even among people who disapproved of their party’s candidate, those for whom political party was more causally central [in their self-concept] were more likely to nevertheless vote with their party”, write the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this principle is not just limited to party affiliation – or unique to the United States. In a second study, 243 UK participants who identified as British or English completed a similar survey. But rather than looking at party affiliation, the researchers were interested in the centrality of national identity to people’s self-concept and how this related to their voting behaviour – this time in the Brexit referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that people whose national identity (either their Britishness or Englishness) was central to their self-concept were more likely to have voted for Brexit.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research sheds light on how political identity affects some people’s behaviour more than others, say the authors. But this research focused on outcomes directly relevant to a person’s political affiliations. It remains to be seen whether the “centrality” of people’s political beliefs in their identity also influences more downstream cognitive processes, such as how objectively they can appraise evidence that supports their political viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300034&quot;&gt;The role of causal beliefs in political identity and voting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Detaining vulnerable immigrants negatively affects their mental health</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/05/detaining-vulnerable-immigrants-negatively-affects-mental-health/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/iStock-535171907-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1945-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our systematic review&lt;/a&gt; found that detention had a detrimental effect on an individual’s mental health, over and above the negative impact caused by uncertain immigration status. Not exactly a shocking revelation, I know. However, this finding supports those of a previous review by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200410&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robjant and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrated adverse mental health consequences of immigration detention are consistently recognised internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of clinical assessments conducted in detention settings has been identified…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into immigration detention is sparse and, when it is conducted, it often has various methodological problems. One of the reasons for this is that research in detention facilities is severely restricted, with random sampling being the norm. Consequently, recruiting detainees usually takes place in communal areas such as break rooms or cafeterias, which could result in a bias towards including individuals that are healthier than the average immigrant detainee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue regularly encountered, especially with studies analysing secondary data, is that data recording within detention centres is largely flawed and disorganised. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/2/health-people-australian-immigration-detention-centres&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found a lack of available records for many detainees, and only 7% of all recorded detention centre interventions included a formal mental state examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further problems can be identified in the execution and reporting of detention centre studies. That is, the majority of studies do not describe the detention environment in enough detail for it to be considered as a potential influencing factor (over and above the effect of being detained itself) on the mental health of detainees. This also makes it extremely difficult to generalise or compare the findings from different studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;there are various ways to improve the current immigration system in order to minimise further harm…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many studies have relied on self-report measures, which are often not validated specifically for use with detainee populations, and should not be equated to diagnostic clinical assessments. A lack of clinical assessments conducted in detention settings has been identified as well. Finally, the majority of studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal which means that it is more difficult to be certain about the causal link between detention and worsening mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the research with an immigrant detainee population we suggest there needs to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More transparency and better accessibility for researchers in order for them to engage with any detainees that are willing to be interviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More systematic and detailed record-keeping by staff at detention centres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitudinal research that tracks the mental health of detainees from the first few days of being detained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More detailed descriptions by researchers on the detention environment in their papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shift from reliance on self-report questionnaires to implementing more clinical assessments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there are various ways to improve the current immigration system in order to minimise further harm being done to already vulnerable people. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conducting a mental health assessment before detaining an asylum seeker or refugee, to ensure that any individuals deemed vulnerable or already suffering from a mental health problem are identified and not detained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mental health assessments routinely conducted to monitor the health of those people already in detention. These assessments should then lead to adequate mental health treatment for individuals and full consideration of their release from detention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved training of detention staff could lead to improvements in the wellbeing of detainees. This suggestion is in line with research which demonstrated that perceived support from staff had a positive impact on quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A greater focus on minimising the length of detention with particular importance on introducing a statutory limit on duration of detention in the UK, such as that which exists in all other EU countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A detention policy that takes into account the multiple expressions of distress and vulnerability that does not rely solely on Western conceptualisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detention should be viewed as a traumatic experience in and of itself. It worsens the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees, and this is particularly true for detainees who were vulnerable before detention. On a more hopeful note, there has been an increase in research on detained immigrants in the past 10 years and with this comes an increased profile with the media, public and policymakers – this might just be enough to lead to real positive changes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, so much of what happens to us in life is random – we are pawns at the mercy of Lady Luck. To take ownership of our experiences and exert a feeling of control over our future, we tell stories about ourselves that weave meaning and continuity into our personal identity. Writing in the 1950s, the psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/erik-erikson-knew-that-self-invention-takes-a-lifetime&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Erikson&lt;/a&gt; put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be adult means among other things to see one’s own life in continuous perspective, both in retrospect and in prospect … to selectively reconstruct his past in such a way that, step for step, it seems to have planned him, or better, he seems to have planned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside your chosen values and goals in life, and your personality traits – how sociable you are, how much of a worrier and so on – your life story as you tell it makes up the final part of what in 2015 the personality psychologist Dan P McAdams at Northwestern University in Illinois &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guilford.com/books/The-Art-and-Science-of-Personality-Development/Dan-McAdams/9781462529322&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the “personological trinity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of us tell these stories more explicitly than others – one person’s narrative identity might be a barely formed story at the edge of their consciousness, whereas another person might literally write out their past and future in a diary or memoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, there’s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845117/&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that prompting people to reflect on and tell their life stories – a process called “life review therapy” – could be psychologically beneficial. However, most of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2562588/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has been on older adults and people with pre-existing problems such as depression or chronic physical illnesses. It remains to be established through careful experimentation whether prompting otherwise healthy people to reflect on their lives will have any immediate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relevant factor in this regard is the tone, complexity and mood of the stories that people tell themselves. For instance, it’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-32132-5_808-1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who tell more positive stories, including referring to more instances of personal redemption, tend to enjoy higher self-esteem and greater “self-concept clarity” (the confidence and lucidity in how you see yourself). Perhaps engaging in writing or talking about one’s past will have immediate benefits only for people whose stories are more positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_5506221032714862637gmail-ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12449&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;, Kristina L Steiner at Denison University in Ohio and her colleagues looked into these questions and reported that writing about chapters in your life does indeed lead to a modest, temporary self-esteem boost, and that in fact this benefit arises regardless of how positive your stories are. However, there were no effects on self-concept clarity, and many questions on this topic remain for future study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36157&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steiner’s team tested three groups of healthy American participants across three studies. The first two groups – involving more than 300 people between them – were young undergraduates, most of them female. The final group, a balanced mix of 101 men and women, was recruited from the community, and they were older, with an average age of 62.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format was essentially the same for each study. The participants were asked to complete various questionnaires measuring their mood, self-esteem and self-concept clarity, among other things. Then half of them were allocated to write about four chapters in their lives, spending 10 minutes on each. They were instructed to be as specific and detailed as possible, and to reflect on main themes, how each chapter related to their lives as a whole, and to think about any causes and effects of the chapter on them and their lives. The other half of the participants, who acted as a control group, spent the same time writing about four famous Americans of their choosing (to make this task more intellectually comparable, they were also instructed to reflect on the links between the individuals they chose, how they became famous, and other similar questions). After the writing tasks, all the participants retook the same psychological measures they’d completed at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants who wrote about chapters in their lives displayed small, but statistically significant, increases to their self-esteem, whereas the control-group participants did not. This self-esteem boost wasn’t explained by any changes to their mood, and – to the researchers’ surprise – it didn’t matter whether the participants rated their chapters as mostly positive or negative, nor did it depend on whether they featured themes of agency (that is, being in control) and communion (pertaining to meaningful relationships). Disappointingly, there was no effect of the life-chapter task on self-concept clarity, nor on meaning and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_5506221032714862637gmail-ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow long do the self-esteem benefits of the life-chapter task last, and might they accumulate by repeating the exercise? Clues come from the second of the studies, which involved two life chapter-writing tasks (and two tasks writing about famous Americans for the control group), with the second task coming 48 hours after the first. The researchers wanted to see if the self-esteem boost arising from the first life-chapter task would still be apparent at the start of the second task two days later – but it wasn’t. They also wanted to see if the self-esteem benefits might accumulate over the two tasks – they didn’t (the second life-chapter task had its own self-esteem benefit, but it wasn’t cumulative with the benefits of the first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear exactly why the life-chapter task had the self-esteem benefits that it did. It’s possible that the task led participants to consider how they had changed in positive ways. They might also have benefited from expressing and confronting their emotional reactions to these periods of their lives – this would certainly be consistent with the well-documented benefits of expressive writing and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/09/twitter-study-confirms-the-power-of-affect-labelling-emotions-are-calmed-by-putting-them-into-words/&quot;&gt;affect labelling&lt;/a&gt;” (the calming effect of putting our emotions into words). Future research will need to compare different life chapter-writing instructions to tease apart these different potential beneficial mechanisms. It would also be helpful to test more diverse groups of participants and different “dosages” of the writing task to see if it is at all possible for the benefits to accrue over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said: “Our findings suggest that the experience of systematically reviewing one’s life and identifying, describing and conceptually linking life chapters may serve to enhance the self, even in the absence of increased self-concept clarity and meaning.” If you are currently lacking much confidence and feel like you could benefit from an ego boost, it could be worth giving the life-chapter task a go. It’s true that the self-esteem benefits of the exercise were small, but as Steiner’s team noted, “the costs are low” too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: The absurdity of drugged assault</title>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/04/04/the-absurdity-of-drugged-assault/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itsonus.org/&quot;&gt;Campus assault&lt;/a&gt; has been on my mind recently, with this month being sexual assault awareness month. I am also a survivor… I think. That may sound odd – how am I not sure? Is it denial? Perhaps, but I think the larger problem is that I was probably drugged at the time. Not being certain makes it difficult to come to terms with the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugged assault is hard to address because it affects multiple memory systems in different ways. The victim’s implicit memory carries the trauma and confusion associated with the drugging. However, they may not have a good enough episodic memory to realize they have been emotionally or physically injured. And so they may never seek treatment to repair the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that most victims of this crime have not yet achieved justice for the damage wrought to our physical, mental, and spiritual health. Nor the healing needed to treat the split between their implicit and explicit memory systems. I’m fortunate that I have had support and wisdom from folks in my life who have helped me weather the discomfort of living with a significant uncertainty for a long period of time. For other folks struggling with this uncertainty, I want to share a story of a time that I was probably drugged to remind you that you’re not alone.  And while I have your attention, let me also say: life can get better. But that’s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school year had just wrapped up and I was preparing for summer school. Dorms were closed till the fall and I faced that age-old college student dilemma: where do I live for the summer, and how do I move my stuff there with no car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My task was complicated by having already secured furniture for me and my roommate.  I would have to move not just my clothes and supplies, but also two desks, two mattresses and bed frames, and two night tables to my summer apartment. Having limited savings, I asked someone who had a van if I could borrow it and just pay for gas money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day of the move, I walked across campus to borrow the van, then spent a few hours driving around campus, loading furniture and my other stuff. It took several hours to unload the furniture at my new, second-floor apartment with no elevator. I was sweaty, dirty, and tired as I drove the van back to my friend’s place, hoping I would be able to finish rearranging all my new stuff before the afternoon was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I dropped off the van back at this guy’s apartment and as I was turning to walk back home, he offered me some orange juice. This seemed logical at the time, to rehydrate after a long day of physical labor. But something odd happened after I drank the juice. My mind went blank and the next thing I knew, I was back at my new apartment with all my furniture still scattered about, except I think it was the next day. And I felt as though I had a memory gap after that. It was like &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the blind spot in our visual fields&lt;/a&gt;: you don’t notice it’s missing until you really go looking for it. I remember feeling oddly tired or unable to move and very confused about where my time had gone. But the odd feeling was there if I tried to go looking for it, tried to focus on the gap in my memory and the discontinuities of my condition before and after moving the furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t go looking to fill the gap right away – I had furniture to rearrange, meals to cook after a whole year of meal plan, and summer school classes to take. I did have a slightly odd feeling when I saw him at social events or walked past his apartment for the next several weekends, sort of like what happens if you try to push two positive magnets together. The fragmented and terrifying memory slipped away when I tried to access it, repelled by the associated discomfort and terror I felt as I began to dip into the memory. But I had a routine that worked for me, so I was able to ignore the weird mental feeling after awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That weird feeling rose to the front of my conscious mind again – as it does sometimes – after reading a recent report that students are concerned they have been subjected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailytrojan.com/2018/11/02/usc-sends-memo-on-nonconsensual-drugging/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonconsensual drugging&lt;/a&gt; at my alma mater. It’s heartening that someone had the wherewithal to speak up about this problem – I didn’t have the awareness to realize at the time that I had probably been drugged. And I definitely did not know what to do about it or who to tell. Given my ignorance about the prevalence of druggings and my trust in this person, it took me many years to even consider that he could have done such a thing, let alone accept that it probably happened. It was incredibly isolating and damaging to my relationship with myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any readers fortunate enough not to have experienced this firsthand, I can assure you that it is quite psychologically disorienting to be drugged, or even to strongly suspect it without corroboration. It’s terrifying and humiliating. It is also quite debilitating and emasculating. To consider that there was a period of time during which I was not under my own agency, and during which I was subject to abuse and humiliating treatment that I did not consent to or even consciously recognize, is upsetting. The experience created a disconnect between my conscious, voluntary mind that was unaware of what happened and my subconscious, subcortical memory structures, which were plagued by an unreachable, unworkable fragment of trauma. As a free individual and an adult, I expect to be in control of my own mind, body, privacy, and health. This person violated me – body and mind. He had no right to do what he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I couldn’t have told you why consciously, but I stopped asking people for help with moving after that. I could only remember that something about asking for help made me really, really scared. Somehow I realized that it was safer to just reserve a U-Haul, take a bus to the U-Haul station, and then drive the giant-ass truck around downtown L.A. between my dorm and a storage unit, loading and unloading all my stuff on my own timeline. I got pretty good at it and mastered the finer details of U-Hauling – the slower rhythm required to drive a large U-Haul truck (never try to make a yellow light or turn right on red, even after stopping), the importance of renting a large enough truck that it has a built-in ramp and paying extra for the dolly so that (un)packing is faster and easier on your back. It got to be fun, too. Exploring the neighborhood near the various U-Haul centers close to my university, waving at the day-laborers outside the U-Haul stations who would cheer me on as I walked from the bus stop to the rental office. The feeling of accomplishment after a long day of moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I am still really confused about what happened to me in college. I can’t comprehend the incredible level of entitlement to my body, mind, and life that this person must have had to enable him to drug me. In this country, if you want to administer drugs to someone, usually you would first go to school for many years to obtain a pharmacy, nursing, or medical doctor degree. Then, after appropriate residency internships and fellowships, you would be able to see patients who voluntarily come to you because they have a medical condition. You would then have a consultation with the patient, learn what other medications they are on, and discuss the risks and benefits of the drug. All of this would happen before you administered it to them, with their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about someone slipping a drug into my drink, I feel extra gross about it when considering the whole pharmaceutical angle. During college I was on and off Accutane and BCPs (birth control pills) for cystic acne and later was on a muscle relaxant and pain medication for a spinal injury. Mixing date rape drugs with these medications taxes the liver and/or brain and multiplies the risk of death. It hadn’t occurred to me in college to share my medical history and details indiscriminately with those around me, but I decided to share them here, now, in case it gives even one potential perpetrator pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I’m looking at this problem from a medical perspective, it’s worth mentioning the Guardasil vaccine. I waited to get it until I met my future husband because it seemed unnecessary to me before that time in my life. I now know that was unwise. To anyone headed to college or not, I say: g&lt;span&gt;et the HPV vaccine (Guardasil) whether you’re a guy or a girl or something else. Around age 13 is good, but any time before college is better than too late. Get it whether or not you’re planning to become sexually active any time soon. You don’t have full control over who or what comes into contact with your body, especially not if you get drugged, so it’s best to make yourself less susceptible to cancer-causing STDs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The vaccine reduces the risk of developing abnormal or precancerous growths on your soft tissues (which can lead to cancer) by helping you create antibodies to fight off HPV. HPV can make its way into your body any time there are soft tissues in contact, which means mouths and lady-bits mostly. When HPV is transmitted to your body, your body usually fights it off within 1-3 years. If the virus is able to disrupt your soft tissue cells significantly before it is cleared, then in another few years you may start showing precancerous growth that needs to be removed as a precaution against cancer. So women especially, make sure to get those pap smears regularly, &lt;strong&gt;even if&lt;/strong&gt; you don’t think that you have been sexually active. All it takes is a single date with an unscrupulous friend and – BOOM – you could be at risk for cervical cancer. (There is technically a risk of penile cancer too; I believe it is almost inconsequentially low for most men.) The good news is that, with regular medical exams, any abnormal growths can be discovered and fully removed before they progress into something grave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the last point I wanted to make is a rhetorical question. How do you tell people not to drug you or assault you without sounding creepy? I always thought it would be a basic societal assumption: just as you’d never consider taking a dump in the middle of campus during passing time, nor spray-painting peoples’ backpacks as they walk past you en route to class, wouldn’t you also never put poison in other people’s libations? It seems rather ridiculous to live in a culture where we’d all have to go around constantly telling our &lt;span&gt;classmates and other people who we live with, eat with or hang out with, “By the way, don’t drug me and don’t secretly have non-consensual sex with me or harass me without me knowing about it.” Or, “If I ever look incapacitated, take me to the hospital rather than attempting to make love to my disabled body.” And: “if you want to have some sort of sexual contact with me, make sure you talk with me about it first and that I am conscious and in control of my own body during the experience so we can both be assured that it’s consensual.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden of avoiding an occurrence of drugged assault is on the person with the drugs and the thoughtlessness to slip them into someone else’s refreshments. Just stop. It’s creepy and stupid and selfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a spiritual adviser who emphasized the importance of letting people know when you feel wronged by them or angry with them. So I wrote this post just to let the person who drugged me know: I am angry with you. Angry that you drugged me and tangled up my mind, angry that you did nothing to admit or repair the damage for years, angry that your actions caused me much distress, distraction from my studies and life, and financial harm. It took me years to piece together the possibility that you had poisoned my mind and memory. Those are years that I could have spent doing something other than being burdened with this latent trauma buried in my subconscious, something other than trying to figure out what went wrong with my mind and memory and ability to connect with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fora future post: is there a more efficient way of healing from drugged assault? I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

However multiple studies have suggested that caregivers experience increased levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0882-7974.18.2.250&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychological distress&lt;/a&gt;. Women are particularly implicated in this; across countries and cultures the responsibility of caregiving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/asia/media-centre/news/WCMS_633284/lang--en/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;predominantly falls upon them&lt;/a&gt;. On average women do almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://progress.unwomen.org/en/2015/pdf/UNW_progressreport.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two and a half times&lt;/a&gt; as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Baby boomers’ refers to the social group born between 1946 – 1964, who grew up during a time of rapid global growth after World War II. They have overall higher levels of education and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000312240807300307&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;employment in managerial and professional positions&lt;/a&gt; than their predecessors. This has resulted in female baby boomers looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/52/2/210/614872&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caregiving alternatives&lt;/a&gt;, for example using nursing homes, assisted living, and childcare centers to balance their careers and family lives. In order to examine the need for context-specific mental health care, researchers Chi Chiao and Yun-Yu Chen &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0696-8#Sec1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; psychological distress symptoms and caregiving in women of the baby boomer generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who provided care were found to be 1.3 times more likely to report depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at global aging data, the authors analyzed eight international datasets containing baby boomer cohort data and relevant variables of interest; their final analysis included data for 16,733 female baby boomers. Women who provided care were found to be 1.3 times more likely to report depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts. Interestingly, being either married or employed was linked to lower levels of depression, whilst being both married and employed was associated with greater levels of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms decreased as educational level increased, emphasizing the importance of educational attainment. In terms of employment status, women in countries where there are higher levels of female participation in professional/managerial professions, or countries with higher levels of female vulnerable employment (unpaid family work/self-employed work), are both at a greater risk of experiencing depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10947&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10947&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/work-family-conflict-300x217.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Employed female baby boomers may experience an overspill of stress between their work and family lives, increasing the risk of depressive symptoms. © kieferpix / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors state that these results may be explained by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00726.x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work-family conflict model&lt;/a&gt;, where women experience an incompatibility between work and family responsibilities. This may lead to a build-up of stress and therefore a higher likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although more research is needed, the findings of this study highlight the separately protective effects of educational attainment, employment, and marriage for baby boomer women, and emphasize that specific social contexts must be taken into account when developing preventative and interventional mental health programs amongst women of this generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do students take notes in an optimal fashion, in line with what psychology research identifies as best practice? It’s an important question given that modern surveys suggest that most students’ preferred approach to exam preparation is to memorise their notes. To find out, a team led by Kayla Morehead at Kent State University has quizzed hundreds of university students about their note-taking methods and preferences, and they’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2019.1569694&quot;&gt;reported their findings&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36825&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Morehead’s team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11251-018-9458-0&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;, though complex and mixed, suggests overall that it is better to take notes with pen and paper rather than typing on a laptop (laptops can distract the note-taker and those sat near them, and note-book notes tend to be more varied and less verbatim). Yet nearly half the sample reported that they took lectures notes on a laptop. However, around a third were flexible in their approach – for instance, they resorted to a laptop only when the lecturer spoke quickly. Whether the students’ flexible strategies were effective has not yet been tested by research, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key finding in the psychology literature is that it’s better to use your notes to organise the information you’re learning about, rather than to simply record what you hear verbatim. Nearly 60 per cent of the sample said they organised their notes, meaning a sizeable minority were following a sub-optimal strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning from one’s notes, passively re-reading is an extremely popular strategy, even though it’s more effective to use the notes to test yourself. Over 90 per cent of the current sample said they spent time re-reading while about half tested themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing proportion of students are today enrolled in online courses where they can, in theory, revisit recorded lectures as many times as they like. Perhaps it is this sense of constant availability that explains why only around half of the online-course students in the sample said that they took notes. This is a concerning finding, the researchers said, since the ability to revisit online lectures does not negate the benefit of taking organised notes from them, nor using those notes for self-testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one sample, based in the US, and the findings could be different in other cultures and settings. Nonetheless, there no obvious reason to suppose the findings would be radically different elsewhere: the mundanity and apparent simplicity of taking notes belies the importance of this activity for learning, and anecdotally, it’s rare for students to receive formal advice or tuition on how to take notes.  Among the current sample, fewer than half of participants said they’d received any formal training and nearly 60 per cent said they would like to take better notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the importance of effective note-taking to memory for and learning of course content, continuing to examine student note-taking behaviour as technologies change will be an important avenue for future research,” Morehead and her colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;

Their clear preference is to communicate by press release or managed events like webinars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s1600/SwatchSkinFront.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1028&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1116&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s200/SwatchSkinFront.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, this has been the favoured model of commercial legacy publishers for quite some time now. The pity is that it appears to be becoming the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt; for non-profit OA publishers and OA initiatives too. Since the &lt;i&gt;raison d’être&lt;/i&gt; of OA is openness and transparency this is unfortunate. If nothing else, it smacks of hypocrisy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS has been guilty of this in the past – see for instance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/05/13/plos-stakeholders-and-shareholders/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from 2013. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On another occasion in 2011, when PLOS ONE published a controversial paper, I emailed a list of questions to the editorial director (after being invited to do so) only to later receive a message from the publisher saying that it had been decided not to respond to those questions. (As outlined in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/03/plos-one-open-access-and-future-of.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until recently, I had assumed that &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;at least was fully committed to openness. In 2016, for instance, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;posted details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of its publishing costs. But now I am not so sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will preface my further remarks by saying that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is a frequent publisher of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;press releases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and routinely emails me copies of them. In response, I am assiduous in posting details of these releases on social media. As I see it, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; and reporters like me is a two-way thing: I publicise their press releases; they answer my questions. Simples!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, it would seem &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; may not see it in the same way. Let me explain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Signalling something important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month, I was invited to take part in a press briefing webinar with the new &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; Editor-in-Chief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Eisen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who has replaced the founding EiC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randy Schekman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the briefing, practically all the questions posed by journalists were about business models and APCs. These did not seem to me to be questions best directed at an EiC, and in fact, Eisen had little to say in response other than that he believes APCs to be problematic and in any case the focus should be on achieving open access, not worrying about the details of business models. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In subsequently reflecting on the event it occurred to me that the appointment of Eisen is not simply the replacement of one EiC with another Rather, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is surely signalling something important about its future. So far as I am aware this point has not been made by &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; however, and it was not something explored in the press briefing, or indeed in subsequent reporting of the appointment (so far as I am aware).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe I am wrong, but that seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion to reach if one considers that Eisen’s OA advocacy in recent years has been almost exclusively focused on the need to move beyond the journal in favour of preprint archives and post-publication peer review, which is not what &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is about. As Eisen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;put it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a recent Reddit Q&amp;amp;A, “I would advocate doing away with ALL journals – not just for profit journals. The issue is that the idea of a journal as an entity that accepts or rejects papers and ‘publishes’ them is antiquated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eisen outlined his ideas on this in a post last year where he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;described&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; what he calls an APPRAISE system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has (so far as I am aware) always positioned itself as a high-quality OA competitor to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;. (I.e. a kind of OA mirror image of those journals). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, when pressed by its funders to become sustainable, &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;chose not to try something new and different, but simply emulated other publishers by introducing APCs (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$2,500 per article). It has yet to achieve sustainability, but in February the outgoing EiC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;appeared to indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the objective and approach remained the same, with sustainability expected to be achieved (in the next two or three years) by a doubling of the number of submissions to &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, this seems very different to Eisen’s view of the world. And that is why I am inclined to conclude that his appointment suggests that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is planning to reinvent itself. Either that or there is some kind of misalignment between &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; world view and that of its new EiC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is just speculation because, as far I am aware, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has not stated that it is planning to reinvent itself. Anyway, I was by now sufficiently intrigued that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; press officer contacted me after the briefing, I responded with some questions. And when it seemed that I was not making much progress that way, I suggested doing a formal Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; Executive Director Mark Patterson. I was told that he was happy to do this and so emailed over the list of questions below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, in a strange echo of my experience with PLOS, a week later I received an email saying, “We’ve reviewed the questions that you sent over, and there’s not much more that we’re able to add in response at this stage.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a subsequent email I was told, “The answers to the questions we have not already addressed will become clear in time, and we’ll be happy to share more information as it’s available. Having seen all your questions, it’s simply that we’re not prepared to answer them all right now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Out of sync?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I get that if &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is in the middle of a strategic review it might not want to provide detailed answers to one or two of my questions, but for Patterson not to answer any of the questions I sent below seems out of sync both with &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; claimed commitment to openness and transparency, and with the unspoken contract I believe should exist between organisations and those like me who report on them: I publicise their news and developments; they answer my questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Either way, I have to wonder why &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was not willing to answer some of the questions. Why, for instance, was it not prepared to say whether Eisen has ever had an EiC position before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, why seven months after the initiative was announced was &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;not prepared to share with me its views on Plan S, why was it not prepared to say how many APC waivers it is granting, and why was it not prepared to rehearse for me the results of the peer review trial it held last year? Why also was it not prepared to say whether it believes Read-and-Publish agreements will prove cheaper than the traditional Big Deal, and what impact these agreements might have on small publishers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More puzzlingly, why if he was unwilling to answer any of the questions I sent him did Patterson agree to do an interview in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is all the more baffling to me given that the day before &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; emailed to say it was not prepared to answer my questions, Eisen was introducing himself on Reddit by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that his objective is “to build a new ecosystem of scholarly publishing based not on journals, but on immediate, author-driven publication coupled with post-publication peer review and curation, and the role I envision &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; will play in this new ecosystem”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that Q&amp;amp;A he also said, “F1000Research isn’t, at least not yet, interested in doing anything beyond technical peer review of papers. They do an excellent job of this, but it’s a different problem than what I was thinking with APPRAISE, and now what I want to do at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, which is to help organize the literature, to help people find what’s interesting and important to them, and to help contextualize works for readers, and to help authors and people potentially interested in hiring, promoting or funding them to know what the community thinks of the quality and impact of their work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could not &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; have responded to my questions about its future strategy by at least saying something similar to that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Financial models?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting that the very &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise#comment-155&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;first question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; posted in response to Eisen’s outline of his APPRAISE idea was, “Fascinating stuff, but what’s the financial model here?” – a question to which Eisen did not respond. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, if the new strategy of &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; involves making APPRAISE a reality some kind of a financial modelling will be necessary, not least because if the publisher is still not sustainable and its funders expect it to become so in the next few years, it will presumably need to find additional resources from somewhere. In other words, while business models may not be something Eisen is concerned about, someone at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; needs to take an interest in them. It was partly in order to gain some understanding of this that I invited Patterson to do a formal Q&amp;amp;A. And I asked him specifically because as &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; Executive Director I assume that is his bag. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doubtless the open source &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/33e4127f/elife-introduces-libero-a-new-open-source-tool-for-publishing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; products that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is co-developing are relevant here too. And I was again puzzled that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was not prepared to answer my question about its open source activities even though it has been giving webinars on the topic (e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/f8226477/in-publishing-the-latest-on-the-open-source-publishing-platform-libero&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I can only conclude that while &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is happy to broadcast press releases and organise managed events, it is reluctant to answer specific questions from reporters outside of these managed events. A cynic might think that this is because reporters tend to ask probing questions – questions like, “Was that a wise decision you made?” and “Where is the business model here?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also worth pointing out that in the webinar linked above &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; &lt;u&gt;was&lt;/u&gt; asked about business models. The reply was that business models are not relevant to non-profits, which have only to achieve sustainability. This seems to me to miss the point that in order to achieve sustainability some kind of financial model is necessary – as Knowledge Unlatched &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;discovered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact is that regardless of any new development work Eisen might be hoping to see at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, 30% of its expenditures are already going towards “technology and innovation”. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has made it clear that Libero Publisher is being developed as a post-peer-review publishing platform, not some kind of preprint APPRAISE solution. If those authors (and/or their institutions) who are now having to pay &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; APCs find themselves having to subsidise a growing number of technology projects, they might start to feel a little aggrieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Presumably, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; hopes that at some point it will be able to earn revenue from providing software-as-a-service solutions around Libero – much as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public Knowledge Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; does with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Journal Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; platform. The challenge, of course, is that developing new publishing workflow systems is neither easy nor cheap, as PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt;. True &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is sharing the load with third parties – but even so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post is about my personal disappointment with &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, but I believe there is a wider issue here: what I perceive to be a decreasing level of openness in the OA movement – an issue I have previously raised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I think we can see the same trend evident in the way in which Plan S was developed and proposed. But do not those who advocate for open access and greater transparency (which, we could note, they consistently demand of legacy publishers) have a responsibility to walk the talk themselves, not least by answering reporters’ questions? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, I await with interest to learn more about the future &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; sees for itself in the developing new world of scholarly communication, the role that its new EiC will play in this, and whether the task it set itself in 2012 is about to be recalibrated in a significant way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is just a shame that after appointing a new EiC &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; seems unwilling to answer questions about the significance of its choice, or even answer questions about current OA developments like Plan S and Read-and-Publish agreements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway, for the record, I am posting below the questions I sent to Patterson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Questions for Mark Patterson &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Eisen’s appointment as &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;’s new Editor-in-Chief is an interesting development. As I understand it, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was founded in 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust as a high-quality open-access journal intended to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/infographic-how-is-elife-measuring-up&quot;&gt;compete with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;prestigious subscription journals like &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;. Its first Editor-in-Chief was the besuited, suave Nobel prize winner Randy Schekman. Eisen is the rumbustious T-short wearing co-founder of PLOS. It was PLOS that in 2003 pioneered use of the article-processing charge (APC) and it was PLOS that in 2006 launched PLOS ONE, which is committed to publishing any paper deemed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines&quot;&gt;technically rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;model has been characterised by some as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html&quot;&gt;bulk-publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Eisen is also a firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise&quot;&gt;advocate for preprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2017/10/q-with-plos-co-founder-michael-eisen.html&quot;&gt;said to me&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “We should all publish in bioRxiv and review papers outside of journals. It’s the only way forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This would seem to be a very different view of scholarly publishing to the one that has been espoused by &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; to date, and so must signal a change of direction for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. How would you characterise that new direction?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Has Mike Eisen ever worked as an Editor-in-Chief before?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; was wholly subsidised by funders for the first five years, but in 2017 it introduced an APC of $2,500. It has, however, yet to become sustainable. Doubtless, that is why during the press call that Eisen gave on March 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; all bar one of the questions asked by journalists were about business models and APCs. Responsibility for business models and financial matters at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is not in fact part of Eisen’s job description. Who is responsible to the &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; Board for business models, financial sustainability and strategy? You as Executive Director perhaps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When pushed on APCs during the press call Eisen said that he views them as problematic. He did not, however, propose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;any alternative way of funding &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, he said that since there is enough money in the current subscription system the research community should simply focus on achieving OA rather than worrying over the details of business models. All that is needed, he said, is to reallocate subscription money to pay for OA. Leaving aside the problem of how one does that, I am wondering if the claim holds up. One of the primary reasons why librarians have been calling for open access over the past 20-odd years is that they say they cannot afford the subscription model, which they believe to be unsustainable. Their assumption has always been that open access will be cheaper and so can solve their affordability problem. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated that OA is cheaper. Nevertheless, librarians continue to insist that they should pay publishers less money. One of the reasons UC gave for walking away from its negotiations with Elsevier recently, for instance, was that the publisher was not prepared to reduce what it charges the university. As Jeff MacKie-Mason &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/02/28/why-uc-split-with-publishing-giant-elsevier/&quot;&gt;has explained&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; UC set two goals when it began the negotiation: “a reduction in costs and default open access publication for UC authors”. At the same time, we could note that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/all-corporate-news/wiley-and-projekt-deal-partner-enhance-future-scholarly-research-an&quot;&gt;Wiley/Project DEAL Read-and-Publish agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is not expected to be any cheaper than a traditional Big Deal. Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think open access will reduce the costs of scholarly publishing? If not, will there not continue to be an unresolved problem in an OA world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As noted, despite introducing an APC, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is still not sustainable. The funders supporting the publisher say they want it to do so in the near future. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; he gave to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; in February, Randy Schekman said, “The journal still receives income from charitable funders, as well as from article-processing charges. But we hope for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; to be self-sustaining within two or three years. The financial models we have drawn show that it can be done.” He added, “We believe that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has the bandwidth to grow maybe two-fold in submissions — and if we do this, we can sustain ourselves without charitable funding.” Eisen seemed unaware of this financial modelling at the time of the press call. Can you say more about it? Is it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;enough (and even possible) to double submissions in the next two or three years? &lt;i&gt;eLife’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/50d52087/annual-report-looking-back-on-2017&quot;&gt;2017 annual report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicated that submissions fell after the introduction of an APC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that same report, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; said that around half of its submissions did not attract a fee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think this was partly because APCs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication&quot;&gt;introduced during the reporting period&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; does also offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#waiver&quot;&gt;waivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for “labs under financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or a lack of funding.” What percentage of the papers &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;is currently publishing are attracting a waiver, and how do you see this changing over time?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; operates a novel open and consultative peer review system. Last year it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2905802e/peer-review-elife-trials-a-new-approach&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;announced a trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to test the feasibility of what it called “a radical form of peer review” in which “once an editor has invited a manuscript for full peer review, the journal is committed to publishing the work along with the reviewer reports, the decision letter, and the author response.” Some initial results of that trial have been published &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/262c4c71/peer-review-first-results-from-a-trial-at-elife&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But how would you summarise these results and how do you envisage peer review developing in future, both at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; and generally in scholarly publishing, particularly in light of the growing preprint movement and Eisen’s view that peer review ought to take place “outside of journals”?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I may have missed it, but I do not believe &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has published a response to Plan S. I do know that when Schekman was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;asked about Plan S in February, he &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “I’m very supportive of this. Open access is the future. Commercial journals have been fighting against this very hard because it poses a clear danger to their profit margin … There will be a shakedown in the business. Some journals will lose out.” Is that &lt;i&gt;eLife’s &lt;/i&gt;official position? If not, what is its position?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the Project DEAL/ Wiley agreement, I am thinking that this model (and/or the Read-and-Publish &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;one) is likely to become the norm going forward, and I assume such deals will eventually be done with Elsevier. The problem for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; I would think is that these are essentially new-style Big Deals, a model that inevitably favours large commercial legacy publishers and by its very nature tends to elbow aside small publishers like &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. Unable to cut such deals with libraries, funders and/or consortia might it be that &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;will be one of the journals to lose out (as Schekman puts it)? How can it best adapt to the kind of changes that initiatives like Plan S are likely to introduce?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; has been actively collaborating with third-parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (including the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coko.foundation/&quot;&gt;Coko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to build open source publishing solutions. Recently it announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/185e0679/elife-announces-first-release-of-open-source-submission-and-peer-review-platform-libero-reviewer&quot;&gt;Libero Reviewer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and it has been experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00724-7&quot;&gt;live-code articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Can you say something about these innovative initiatives and how they fit into &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; strategy going forward?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There has been a lot of interest in the past couple of years in developing funder publishing platforms – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;primarily by using F1000 Research technology. More recently, we have seen Elsevier moving into this space too. For instance, it just announced that it has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/journals-published-by-arab-research-community-set-to-benefit-from-greater-global-visibility-809890046.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reached agreement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with the Association of Arab Universities to use its proprietary platform Digital Commons (bepress) to eventually publish 1,000 Arab journals. What does this tell us about the future of scholarly communication, and where does &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; fit into this development? Does it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it that the topic of open access seems &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;only ever to be able to be discussed in terms of wide-eyed uncritical faith in “the cause”, or bad-tempered complaints about the kind of changes it is leading to – i.e. APCs, mandatory open access policies, predatory publishing etc. Can we ever expect to see a consensus over open access? If so, how?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media and rolling news there’s a constant pressure to be in the know, always on hand with an aperçus or two. Today &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/&quot;&gt;intellectual humility&lt;/a&gt; therefore feels more important than ever – having the insight and honesty to hold your hands up and say you’re ignorant or inexpert about an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists are responding by taking an increasing interest in intellectual humility, including investigating its consequences for learning and the thinking styles that support it. For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Positive Psychology&lt;/em&gt; a team led by Elizabeth Krumrei-Mancuso have continued this endeavour, showing, among other things, that intellectual humility correlates with superior general knowledge. This is a logical outcome because, as the researchers write, “simply put, learning requires the humility to realise one has something to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36821&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krumrei-Mancuso and her colleagues conducted five studies in all, attempting to find out more about the links between intellectual humility and knowledge acquisition; between intellectual humility and meta-knowledge (insight into one’s own knowledge); and lastly between intellectual humility and other thinking styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength and a weakness of the research is the use of two different measures of intellectual humility. Some studies involved a shorter questionnaire assessing being a “know-it-all” (through agreement or not with statements like “I know just about everything there is to know”) and intellectual openness (through agreement or not with statements like “I can learn from other people”); whereas other studies used a more recently developed, more comprehensive 22-item measure incorporating questions about cognitions, emotions and behaviours representative of intellectual humility (such as, being accepting of criticism of one’s important beliefs; being ready to change one’s mind; and respect for others’ viewpoints). This use of different measures makes for a more comprehensive, varied assessment of intellectual humility, but also impedes comparison between the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in relation to knowledge acquisition were mixed. While an online study involving 604 adults (and using the more comprehensive measure of intellectual humility) found the aforementioned link between greater intellectual humility and superior general knowledge, another involving college students (and the briefer intellectual humility questionnaire) found that those higher in intellectual humility achieved poorer grades. Perhaps the latter result arose because the higher-achieving students used their objectively higher grades to judge their intellectual ability as higher, not having had the chance yet in life to confront their intellectual fallibility (but as mentioned, the use of different measures across the studies complicates any interpretation of the mixed results).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of insight, higher scorers in intellectual humility were less likely to claim knowledge they didn’t have (the researchers tested this by assessing participants’ willingness to claim familiarity with entirely fictitious facts that they couldn’t possibly know), and they also tended to underestimate their performance on a cognitive ability test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other thinking styles and constructs that correlated with greater intellectual humility included being more inclined to reflective thinking, having more “need for cognition” (enjoying thinking hard and problem solving), greater curiosity, and open-minded thinking. More intellectual humility was also associated with less “social vigilantism”, defined as seeing other people’s beliefs as inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new findings “replicate and extend previous studies using different measures of intellectual humility”, it’s fair to say there remains a great deal we don’t yet know about intellectual humility. Perhaps most important is the lack of longitudinal research to establish causality – for instance, we don’t yet know if greater general knowledge and open-mindedness fosters intellectual humility, or if intellectual humility comes first, and promotes knowledge and curiosity. Most likely the causal associations between these constructs are complex and two-way, but at the moment, if we’re honest, we just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Na Helian's journal club session, where she will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf&quot;&gt;OPTICS Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (Mihael Ankerst et al, 1999)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-datasets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to thedensity-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

After several weekends spent explaining your research in 10-minute segments to complete strangers, you’re hoping to ultimately have a place to call &lt;em&gt;lab&lt;/em&gt;, and a city to call &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you look back on your visits, it’s a whirlwind of graduate students, science, faculty members, walking, and beer. How, in Carl Sagan’s name, are you supposed to choose one school over another? To complicate such decisions, opaque ranking systems are putting dubious numerical values on your hodgepodge of memories and tired feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m no expert on choosing graduate schools or advisors — after all, I’ve only done it once. However, I’ve witnessed my colleagues disperse in all sorts of directions as far as institutions and advisors, some for better, and some for &lt;em&gt;ehh &lt;/em&gt;not so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*7HIduiCLF0tvZAuo.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you? &lt;/strong&gt;Before comparing programs, it’s a good idea to do some personal reflection. It’s impossible to know how you’ll feel at the end of graduate school, or even in a year, but your current decision depends on how you feel now. Check in with yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are you going to graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you see yourself doing after graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With those two answers in mind, how long would you like to spend in graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on prior work experience, consider the kind of leadership you work well with. Do you prefer supervisors to be hands-off, or very involved in your daily activities?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/&quot;&gt;this comprehensive survey&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by AAAS to help identify your needs, strengths, and weaknesses, as well your career options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, young reckless Jedi, ready are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you like the students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a major aspect of visiting the campus. Did you meet people you can see being scientifically as well as socially supportive? Were they, in general, pleasant? The emotional state of students (especially those past the third year) is incredibly indicative of the health of a graduate program. Think about the kind of people you want to be surrounded by for the next five years; even if the individuals change, the ethos of the program is unlikely to change that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All together now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science thrives in a collaborative and cohesive environment built on personalities that promote these characteristics. Ask students if they would feel comfortable asking another student in the program for experience or insight on a particular project or technique. In most of the places I’ve worked, people readily email around to borrow reagents or equipment and research moves quicker as a result. An institution that promotes collaboration across students and labs is likely to be a happier and better place to do science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure there are five advisors you can imagine yourself working with &lt;/strong&gt;(applicable for programs with research rotations).&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you’ve heard this already: do not choose an institution for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; star faculty member. Yes, you interviewed with them and the research is absolutely jaw dropping, but you should not depend on one person unless you have an explicit agreement with them or extensive prior experience with the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure there are 2–3 people you’re confident would be a good fit, with at least another 2 that you see as very strong possibilities. Reflect on your own goals for the type of research you hope to do (behind a computer or a lab bench?) and make sure the institution has several faculty members in each corner of your comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, compare your expectations for the length of your PhD to the program’s average as well as the labs that interest you. Some advisors regularly have graduate students for 7+ years, whereas others are known for graduating students much earlier. You might not mind sticking around for 7 years, but it’s a good thing to know in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask ahead of time about funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not coming in with your own funding, make sure the program will fund you for at least the first year. It is a very good sign if the program has &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants&quot;&gt;an institutional training grant&lt;/a&gt; (hint: you can search for your institution/organization on &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectreporter.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH RePORT&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about funding in a particular lab, it is definitely okay to ask if they will be able to fund you. Funding is a fact of life in science; the earlier you have those open conversations, the better off you’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is administrative infrastructure for student support.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want an administration that will help structure your experience in graduate school, elicit and implement your feedback, as well as springboard you into the next phase of your career. Graduate school can be quite amorphous without some structure; although this is okay for some students, it can be unmanageable for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some programs involve students on executive committees and schedule yearly feedback meetings. Not only does this demonstrate that the program cares, but also that it is organized enough internally to seek external advice. It’s definitely a plus if the department takes the time and money to plan seminar series and social events for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;about the science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you want to attend a university with an abundance of top-notch research, but you also need to be in a place where you can be a happy person. It is not shallow or unprofessional to choose a place where you think you’ll feel safe and at ease. You might decide that you’d prefer to be in a bustling city versus a quiet suburb, or in a place that offers cultural and social opportunities that fit your needs. You’ll spend long hours in the lab, but you also need long hours relaxing and doing things that you love, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/the-picnic-guidelines-re-written-1a8a9ef0841c&quot;&gt;having picnics&lt;/a&gt;. After all, your life outside of the lab enhances your ability to do good science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TtUmE7IrPaTvTrij3avIjA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;It’s totally reasonable to choose a program simply because of the presence of palm trees. Too far? Too far. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently making a choice between schools, don’t hesitate to ask additional questions of your host, other graduate students, or faculty you spoke to. This is your chance to gather as much information as you can so that you can feel confident in your decision. If they don’t answer your concerns, you may have your answer right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend a week pretending you’re going to one school. Take the next week and pretend you’re going to another school. Dwell on those indescribable responses to how it feels, remain open to unforeseen opportunities, and trust your intuition. As Richard Feynman aptly said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was originally posted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuwritesd.org/2014/03/20/you-interviewed-now-what/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NeuWriteSD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and has been edited to update its content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This post is the beginning of a conversation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “&lt;em&gt;So you want to be a neuroscientist? An honest account of life as a researcher” (Columbia University Press). &lt;/em&gt;The goal is to offer aspiring neuroscientists honest, informative insight about our field as well as education and careers in it. Most importantly, it will reflect the opinions and experience of our entire community — so, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback. What did I miss?

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: The Business of Bystanding</title>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/04/02/the-business-of-bystanding/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For many centuries, corporations and academia have been working to fulfill those goals I just listed above. But we are not anywhere as successful today as we should be, considering our collective knowledge and competence. #MeTooSTEM, #MeToo, and #UsToo have shown that. So how come we don’t have it all figured out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy answer is that the rules and players on our teams are changing. Televised news and movie watching changed our rules for how we treat each other over the course of the last century. Where before we would jump in to assist in an impending tragedy or intervene to de-escalate a fight that was about something of value to us, now we sometimes sit back (or tally points) while we watch because our screens have trained us to be hostages to our feelings and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more difficult answer lies in how differentiated our roles and group missions have become. Over the last several decades, more solo pioneers are advancing across the vast, multidimensional landscape that is corporate and academic America. I am excited for us because I know we can be competent at the work. And I am frustrated for us, because the solo pioneering feels unsafe although it is taking place in our own homes, towns, communities, and country… where we should ostensibly feel and be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of safety – felt and actual – is one that will take many posts to cover. What I want to discuss today and in my next post is how we can adapt to our changed rules and teammates. Change is difficult for everyone, even when it’s toward a common goal. For most of our history, we have known that change can be difficult and that certain types of dynamics tend to creep into our groups and structures over time. The difficulty arises when we become too fractured or unequal. I think this is a real danger in the community generally and even in such ostensibly cohesive communities like many U.S. universities. I would venture to say that R01-intensive research universities can almost intentionally perpetuate this fractious existence, with their extreme specialization in academia and large inequalities in training and experience of the different roles that make up a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I don’t know how to adapt, it’s just something I do, something we all do somehow. I think healthy communities can enable people to adapt in their own way by painting a clear picture of the goal, the target towards which we are adapting. And that is done by setting expectations and constructively communicating our satisfaction in instances where community members meet those expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here, I have ventured into abstract territory when I really wanted to provide some examples of bystanding gone right or wrong, from my point of view. First, an example of bystanding gone wrong. Remember that odd character associated with my church from a few posts ago, Matt R? Well that person made me feel uncomfortable, sort of creeped-out occasionally, even before I came to the conclusion that they had pawned me. But did I say anything to call attention to it or warn other people about their creepiness? Not quite. And why not? Mostly because I could never quite put my finger on what exactly was wrong. It was mostly an odd feeling, almost an aura surrounding him. It felt stupid and uncharitable to say to the people around me, “This person, Matt, seems somehow sort of fake or  inconsistent or unconcerned with other people’s feelings and safety.” I couldn’t think of concrete, objective observations that were likely to convince me or others of what exactly felt wrong about this person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few small things that seemed petty or trivial to bring up, and so I didn’t. But should I have? How much would it really have helped to complain to the people around me, “Matt seemed angry at another church member who had asked Matt not to gossip about her,” or “Matt got annoyed with me for asking him to drive one extra block to drop me off right at my car after carpooling to dinner.” In retrospect, now that I have written this, it occurs to me that I could have contributed more to Matt’s gas money and veggie burger fund. Perhaps that was part of the source of the drama. And Matt was generally good company to be around, usually happy and witty and knowledgeable about fun places to go around town or good music to listen to. But I digress. The point I wanted to make here is that I didn’t know how to constructively set expectations for my social circle, which probably contributed to me feeling as though I had gotten pawned by this Matt. If I had been able to do that constructively, I could have helped myself and been a better bystander to my community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example of bystanding gone wrong, involving a guy I had a crush on in school. I once saw him acting a bit oddly, really goofy in fact. We were at a social event in a public place, and I took a picture of him because he was acting so funny – he was really in my face when normally he was a calm, gentle person. I gave him the picture a few days later, assuming he would find his goofy grin as funny as I had. But he didn’t. In fact, the opposite happened. He had no idea how he had come to look like that picture of himself. And he got upset as he searched the picture for clues to understand how, when, where this had happened. He started asking questions, “When was this? Was I drunk?” At first I laughed a bit because I was so surprised by his confusion and it seemed funny. But I really didn’t like to see him that distressed, and as I realized his discomfort was serious, I calmed down and tried to start figuring out with him just when I had taken the picture and why he seemed to have no memory of it. But just then, someone else walked by and took the picture away and indicated that it was move on with whatever project we had been in the middle of. So we never did get to the bottom of his confusion and I felt bad that I had not been able to help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now here’s an example of bystanding that went … not fully right. It happened at church, of all places, and it involved Matt R., again. I had been chatting with someone else from my church, a guy with whom I had gone to the movies once and had a bad experience. I still talked to him at church though, because he was a member of that community and I considered it important to be hospitable to people in my church community. Anyway, as our conversation drew to a close, I was going to excuse myself and walk home. My friend offered to walk me home and I declined because I still felt a bit uncomfortable around him. And in general, I didn’t need to be walked home, a walk I took every day, multiple times a day, 99.9% of the time without incident. So I appreciated that he didn’t force his walking services on me, respecting me enough to respect my answer. But then, Matt got really mad that my friend had respected my “no.” Matt R. tried to shame my friend by making a point of walking me home, so that the next week after church my friend felt compelled to walk me home without asking. He pointed out this odd dynamic to me, which was vaguely helpful, saying “I feel like I owe it to Matt to walk you home.” So this little mini-drama eventually became an example of constructive bystanding by my friend, who modeled the dynamic of trying to balance my request (of not being walked home) with his own conscience about meeting expectations of other members of the community (in this case, Matt R, who had shamed him and who had walked me home previously without asking) while explaining to me the social dynamics that were causing him to interact in a way that was motivated by Matt’s preferences rather than by mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem odd that I would spend so many words detailing what seems like a minor drama. I decided to write about it because it helps illuminate, for me, how unequipped I was to deal with the likes of Matt R. when I was a college student. I didn’t know how to clearly state my observations of their behavior back to them and then share my feelings, needs, and requests. If I had had more experience with constructive communication, giving feedback, and the like, perhaps I would have said something like the following to Matt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just heard you make an example of yourself intending to walk me home when I declined a walking partner. It looked to me as though you were motivated by discomfort or anger. I feel uncomfortable with how you let me know that you intend to walk me home. I feel unsafe and unheard. I need you to let me walk home by myself or to share with me what about that idea makes you uncomfortable. Would you be willing to tell me what prompted you to decide to walk me home so abruptly?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a somewhat foreign way of talking for me and, I suspect, for many people. However, it is also a way to diffuse a difficult situation and have a conversation that can be meaningful and helpful for others. This sample conversation blurb was modeled after Marshall Rosenberg’s principle of nonviolent conversation. I have yet to try it in real life, but eventually I hope to put all my reading to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to close out this post, let me finish with a story of helpful bystanding that was fun! At least, it was fun for me because I was the beneficiary of it. My senior year of college, I moved into an upstairs studio apartment that was unfurnished. But no bother, I had my own furniture as well as all my clothes, luggage, and usual apartment essentials. As I struggled up the stairs with my mattress, I realized that I had vastly, incredibly underestimated the strength and time that would be required for me to move all my stuff into the apartment. At that auspicious moment, my downstairs neighbor appeared and began helping me move all my stuff upstairs. I was grateful for the assistance, as it would have taken me likely close to 20 hours to move all the furniture in, assuming I didn’t fall and break something going up and down the stairs. I had never had help moving furniture from someone who didn’t live with me before, and it felt like a treat to have a neighbor offer to help me out of their own good will without expecting anything in return. This case worked out for me because it was clear that I needed help, the type of help I needed was also clear, and it was something that could be done with good, hard, work and no judgment. And after the move was complete, I took him out for dinner as a thank you and we had a fun evening hanging out and eating pizza downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post, I’ll explore ideas for making more ambiguous situations clear, so that the type of help one can safely and effectively render to a person in need is likely to be clear to both the person in need and their helper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There’s no simple explanation for why psychology has been hit so hard by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;replication crisis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – it’s the result of a complicated mix of professional incentives, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;questionable research practices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and other factors, including the sheer popularity of the sorts of sexy, counterintuitive findings that make for great TED Talk fodder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But that might not be the entire story. Some have also posited a more sociological explanation: political bias. After all, psychology is overwhelmingly liberal. Estimates vary and depend on the methodology used to generate them, but among professional psychologists the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yoelinbar.net/papers/political_diversity.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ratio of liberals to conservatives is something like 14:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. A new PsyArXiv &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/6k3j5/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; first-authored by Diego Reinero at New York University – and involving an “adversarial collaboration” in which “ two sets of authors were simultaneously testing the same question with different theoretical commitments” – has looked for evidence to support this explanation, and found that while liberal bias per se is not associated with research replicability, highly politically biased findings of either slant (liberal or conservative) are less robust.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36811&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The crisis-spurred-by-bias theory goes something like this: Because psychology is so dominated by liberals, a certain groupthink sets in. Findings that appeal to liberal sensibilities aren’t viewed as critically – they’re ushered through the scientific gatekeeping process rather than carefully evaluated. For proponents of this theory, it’s  easy to come up with examples: The Implicit Association Test, for example, posits a very liberal-friendly theory – “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbud8rLejLM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;[almost] everyone’s a little bit racist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;” – and has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;hobbled, lately, by serious questions about what, exactly, it measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But that sort of theorising only gets one so far: If there’s an actual bias helping to determine which questionable findings get published, it should show up at a more zoomed-out level. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; For the new research, consisting of two studies, nearly 200 psychology findings described in published research abstracts (chosen because they have all been subject to subsequent replication attempts in the literature) were rated on a 1-5 scale from liberal to conservative – or put in a separate, no-political-valence category – by coders not otherwise affiliated with the study. In the first study the coders were a “politically balanced sample of six psychology doctoral students (including self-identified liberals, moderates, and conservatives)”, and in the other they were “a larger, politically diverse sample of American residents (using an online Mechanical Turk sample).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For example, a research finding showing that the perceived threat of appearing racist caused whites to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; themselves from blacks in an experiment was coded as liberal; a study in which people burdened with secrets perceived hills to be steeper and weights to be heavier was coded as moderate; and a study which showed that exposure to centerfold erotica caused students to rate photos of opposite-sex nude people as less attractive, relative to the ratings of students in a control condition exposed to abstract art, was coded as conservative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Overall, the majority of findings were rated as being centrist or politically neutral; among those with a bias, there were more findings rated liberal than conservative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If a liberal political bias really has been fueling the replication crisis, it would be through allowing methodologically weaker papers to be published when they had a liberal message, and these papers would then be less likely to replicate later on (replication efforts tend to be conducted carefully enough that they would be unlikely to fall victim to simple political bias).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the authors found no evidence to support this idea. In the first study, “less than 1%” and “less than 2%,” respectively, “of the variance in replicability could be explained by the ideological slant of the original research alone,” and in the second study the variance explained was less than 2 per cent. This would seem like a serious strike against any straightforward idea of a connection between liberal bias and psychology’s replication woes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But the researchers also tested for whether the ideological extremity of findings, liberal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; conservative, was correlated with a lack of replicability. That is, they ignored whether each abstract was coded as liberal or conservative and focused instead on its “distance” from being apolitical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Here’s where the “no liberal bias” takeaway becomes slightly more complicated. With this technique, the researchers found that the more highly ideological a paper was, whether to the left or the right, the less likely it was to replicate – what they called an “ideological extremity effect”. For instance, a strongly liberal-rated study, which showed how subtle cues could make African-American professionals feel unwelcome, failed to replicate, as did the aforementioned, conservative-rated study on centerfold erotica. Overall, “more ideologically slanted research (regardless of liberal vs. conservative ideological slant) was between 34% (Study 1) and 6% (Study 2) less likely to replicate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Taken together our results are a starting point for a richer conversation about the role and influence of politics in science,” the researchers concluded. “Our work suggests that politics may play a role in scientific replicability but not in the way many scholars have thought, as we did not find evidence of a liberal bias and instead found preliminary evidence of an ideological extremity effect.” It suggests that yes, there’s a link between ideology and replication-woes, but one that operates in a significantly more complicated way than some replication-crisis-theorists have posited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/6k3j5/&quot;&gt;Is the Political Slant of Psychology Research Related to Scientific Replicability?&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subject to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version that this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

Our tools provide us with ever-greater  spatial resolution and ideal temporal resolution. But do we have the  right conceptual resolution? This conversation focuses on how we are  doing with this challenge, whether we have examples of successful  linking hypotheses between psychological and neurobiological accounts,  whether we are missing important ideas or tools, and where we might go  or should go, if all goes well. The conversation, in other words,  examines the very core of cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the schedule tomorrow is the public lecture and keynote address by Matt Walker &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cogneurosociety.org/keynote-address&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Sleep?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Can you recall the last time you woke up without an alarm clock feeling refreshed, not needing caffeine? If the answer is “no,” you are not alone. Two-thirds of adults fail to obtain the recommended 8 hours of nightly sleep. I doubt you are surprised by the answer to this question, but you may be surprised by the consequences. This talk will describe not only the good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don’t get enough. The presentation will focus on the brain (learning, memory aging, Alzheimer’s disease, education), but further highlight disease-related consequences in the body (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The take-home: sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset the health of our brains and bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why sleep, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://foals.co.uk/everythingnotsavedwillbelost&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foals&lt;/a&gt; are playing tonight at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefoxoakland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Fox Theater&lt;/a&gt; in Oakland.

&lt;p&gt;Recently popularized by a certain populist political figure the phrase ‘Fake News’ has entered the global public lexicon and is routinely weaponized in the arenas of internet debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoffman presents a debate examining how, for controversial topics, some researchers can be biased towards publishing only positive conclusions whilst others only publish negative conclusions, even when these conclusions use the same data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversial topic for this debate is the efficacy of mammography screening in the detection of breast cancer.   The debate identified 8 manuscripts which studied mammography accuracy and then, through consultation with experts in polarized research, ranked the attitudes of the corresponding authors towards screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that the efficacy of the screening reported in the manuscripts correlated with the ranked attitudes of the corresponding authors, suggesting that personal views were influencing the scientific record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice on how Editors, Reviewers and Researchers can handle conflicts of interest are found within the article’s conclusion.  For instance Editors should take into account the personal biases of researchers when inviting them for peer-review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, with no conflicts of interest whatsoever to declare, it is the position of Liam and Lingling that this is probably the best article on how personal views can influence research published ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0257-6&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Difficulties in administering Euthanasia to patients with Intellectual disabilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) has been legally possible in the Netherlands since 2001 provided the following criteria are met&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The request is voluntary;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The patient’s suffering is unbearable, with no prospect for improvement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The patient is fully informed of the prospect of euthanasia;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no, reasonable, alternative treatment available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one other physician, independent of the one assisting, provides an opinion concurring with the decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on EAS legislation for vulnerable people, especially for those with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, are sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors analyzed 9 case summaries, published between 2012-2016, concerning either intellectual disability or autism and EAS. The authors conclude that the above criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specialist intellectual disability physician is suggested to be involved in all cases where someone with an intellectual disability requests EAS, and that all physicians involved in capacity assessments of patients with intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorder (including those offering a second opinion) must have enhanced training in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, sufficient measures to protect vulnerable patients should be carefully considered while planning to introduce or adapt EAS legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0260-y&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is it ethical to include patients in research?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, research is conducted &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; patients, however increasingly research is being performed with patients collaborating with the investigators.  This phenomenon is termed Patient Engaged Research (PER). At present the ethical issues involved with PER have been largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conducted a three-round Delphi survey with a panel of early-career researchers (ECRs) from various backgrounds, ranging from general practitioners to postgraduate students to identify ethical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced ECRs were more worried about the applied aspects of PER, such as patient remuneration, recognition of patient contributions and confidentiality. In contrast, junior researchers were concerned with theoretical issues, such as power dynamics between researchers and patients and the exploitation of vulnerable persons. However, both junior and senior ECRs felt inadequately prepared to address the ethical issues despite their overall readiness to conduct PER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the establishment of clear ethical standards for PER, the authors fear that the credibility of PER will suffer and its adoption of as a research practice may be inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0268-3&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conscientious objection to abortion by midwives and nurses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abortion remains a morally contentious issue, and some midwives and nurses might decline to recommend it on the grounds that it conflicts with their personally held religious or ethical beliefs. Fleming &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; conducted a systematic review to identify the views of midwives and nurses on the right to object to the provision of an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurses’ and midwives’ views were classified as ‘Moral’, ‘Legal’, ‘Practical or ‘Religious’.  Interestingly all of the manuscripts included in the review, despite being focused on the views of nurses and midwives were written exclusively by physicians, philosophers, legal scholars and lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;81 reasons for midwives and nurses to consciously object to abortion provision were identified.  The most common reason for objection was that one’s conscience is an ‘inner voice that [needs] to be listened to’ and that ‘Religious law should be followed’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons against conscientious objection were also highlighted with the most popular being that health care providers must separate ‘moral belief from [their] professional life’ and that women have a right to access abortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plurality of reasons both for and against the ability of midwives and nurses to refuse to recommend abortions was unearthed but also, and perhaps more importantly, was the dearth of written work directly from these very professions on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0333-y&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;First things first, the ethics of prioritizing global health research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is finite and it is rarely possible to clear one’s inbox let alone address the myriad of health issues which ravage the globe.  As a result the prioritization of which research questions should be tackled first is of upmost importance to policy makers, researchers and ethicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of prioritizing, itself, is an ethical consideration; for instance should the world’s governments, charities and philanthropists focus more on infectious disease research than on, say, curtailing obesity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pratt &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, report on the outcomes of an International Workshop entitled ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/web/5/Ethics-of-Global-Health-Research-Priority-Setting-Workshop.html&quot;&gt;Ethics of Global Health Research Priority&lt;/a&gt;’ held in Oxford.  Global health and ethics experts gathered to discuss the ethical considerations of prioritizing global health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attendees’ reflections have been summarized as 8 research questions such as; “which groups should initiate and lead global health research priority settings?” and “what is the right process for making decisions at this wide world level?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report serves as a guide and as a source of impetus for ethicists, researchers and policymakers to develop ethically sound and robust approaches to setting priorities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the main personality traits, Neuroticism (characterised by emotional instability and lack of resilience) is probably the one with the least going for it. High scorers on this trait are impulsive, tend to worry a lot, and they struggle with low moods and short tempers. Thanks to personality research, we know a lot about what lies in store for people who score high on Neuroticism, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/02/your-personality-may-affect-your-vulnerability-to-mental-health-problems/&quot;&gt;increased risk of mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161205-how-break-ups-change-your-personality&quot;&gt;relationship turmoil&lt;/a&gt;. But as Robert Klein and Michael Robinson note in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12469&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt; we know a lot less about the psychological processes that underlie the trait. From an emotional perspective, neurotic people are said to be more sensitive to threat and punishment, but what about the cognitive side? Across four studies, Klein and Robinson present evidence consistent with what they call the &lt;em&gt;mental noise hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; – “neurotic people have noisier, more chaotic mental control systems”, they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36790&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four studies involved hundreds of undergrad students, who filled out personality questionnaires and then took part in a simple tracking task, in which they had to use a computer mouse or joystick to track a horizontally moving on-screen target with their cursor as accurately as possible. Each tracking trial, of which there were up to 60 per person, lasted between 30 seconds or as little as 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to examine participants’ tracking accuracy with high temporal precision, using the task to assess “micro-momentary disconnections between the mind and its control of the external environment”. Given the shortness of the trials, plus the fact the task did not require storing or manipulating information in working memory, and that there was no need to adjust to different instructions, Klein and Robinson said it was too simple and easy to be considered an “executive function” task (involving more complex mental processes) and was instead best characterised as a “form of mindfulness task that requires intention, attention and awareness concerning a simple activity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, previous research has found an inverse correlation between trait Neuroticism and trait Mindfulness – neurotic folk are often so fretful and distracted with worry about the past and future that they find it difficult to be in the present. However, according to past findings, this distracted state doesn’t manifest in lower IQ or worse job performance. This paradox may be explained by neurotic people compensating by investing more effort than average, the researchers suggested (after all, anxiety-prone people would hate to fail or underperform). Part of the rationale for the tracking task, then, was that it would be so simple that performance would not vary with greater effort – in a sense providing the researchers with a pure measure of their participants’ mental control, or what you could think of as their levels of mental noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to their predictions, the researchers found that across all the studies, higher scorers in Neuroticism were less accurate at tracking the on-screen targets. Also, the link between Neuroticism and poorer performance was consistent, being no greater during earlier or later trials (discounting the influence of factors like fatigue).  “A task with excellent temporal resolution appears to possess considerable value in documenting the sorts of lapses and slips thought to be somewhat endemic to neurotic forms of self-regulation”, the researchers said. In contrast, the other main personality traits, such as Extraversion and Conscientiousness, were not associated with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also blasted the participants with annoying loud white noise at periodic intervals, to see if this had a greater adverse effect on more neurotic participants. Although the noise blasts impaired performance (affecting accuracy for about a second), the degree of impairment wasn’t any greater for more neurotic people. This may be because the distraction of the noise was so immediate and unavoidable that personality differences were not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final study, after completing the tracking task, participants were also asked to keep a two-week daily diary of their feelings of distress and nervousness, as well as any daily stressors, such as feeling like they had too much to do. Poorer performance on the tracking task correlated with more frequent daily experiences of negative emotional states, regardless of any actual stressors. Klein and Robinson said this was consistent with their task being a kind of implicit personality measure: “even brief lapses of attention can reflect the sorts of processes that give rise to longer term affective consequences,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the researchers are correct in their characterisation of Neuroticism – and we need more studies with more diverse participant samples to test their theory – it could open up avenues for interventions to increase emotional stability, for example through &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/01/working-memory-training-could-help-beat-anxiety/&quot;&gt;training to increase mental control&lt;/a&gt; and so reduce mental noise.&lt;/p&gt;

Panel discussions that are too harmonious seem to be divisive. Some people will say, “well, now THAT wasn't very controversial.” But as I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/03/cns2019.html&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, one highlight of the 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/annual-meeting/&quot;&gt;Cognitive Neuroscience Society Annual Meeting&lt;/a&gt; was a Symposium organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psych.nyu.edu/poeppel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. David Poeppel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Session -&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience&quot;&gt;The Relation Between Psychology and Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, David Poeppel, Organizer, &lt;i&gt;Grand Ballroom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Whether we study single cells, measure populations of neurons,  characterize anatomical structure, or quantify BOLD, whether we collect  reaction times or construct computational models, it is a presupposition  of our field that we strive to bridge the neurosciences and the  psychological/cognitive sciences. Our tools provide us with ever-greater  spatial resolution and ideal temporal resolution. But do we have the  right conceptual resolution? This conversation focuses on how we are  doing with this challenge, whether we have examples of successful  linking hypotheses between psychological and neurobiological accounts,  whether we are missing important ideas or tools, and where we might go  or should go, if all goes well. The &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;conversation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in other words,  examines the very core of cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Not debate. So first, let me summarize the conversation. Then I'll get back to the merits (demerits) of debate. In brief, many of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BIG IDEAS&lt;/a&gt; motifs of 2017 were revisited...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Marr and the importance of work at all levels of analysis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;illustration of the three levels&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the “laws” that bridge these levels of analysis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complexityandsociety.com/files/4413/1692/0252/Emergence_as_a_Construct--History_and_Issues.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PDF&quot;&gt;Emergent properties&lt;/a&gt;” – a unique higher-level entity (e.g., consciousness, a flock of birds) emerges from the activity of lower-level activity (e.g., patterns of neuronal firing, the flight of individual birds)... the sum is greater than its parts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative Models – formal models that make computational predictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;...with interspersed meta-commentary on replication, publishing, and Advice to Young Neuroscientists. Without further ado:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. David Poeppel  – Introductory Remarks&lt;/b&gt; that &lt;i&gt;examined the very core of cognitive neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., “we have to face the music”).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the conceptual basis of cognitive neuroscience shouldn't be correlation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;For example, fronto-parietal network connectivity (as determined by resting state fMRI) is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;associated with &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;some cognitive function, but that doesn't mean it &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;causes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;explains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the behavior (or internal thought). We all know this, and we all know that “we must want more!” But we haven't the vaguest idea of how to relate complex psychological constructs such as attention, volition, and emotion to ongoing biological processes involving calcium channels, dendrites, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28093558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'Glutamatergic synapses are structurally and biochemically complex because of multiple plasticity processes: long-term potentiation, long-term depression, short-term potentiation and scaling.'&quot;&gt;glutamatergic synapses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;but what if the psychological and the biological are categorically dissimilar?? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In their 2003 book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Philosophical+Foundations+of+Neuroscience-p-9781405108386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bennett and Hacker warned that cognitive neuroscientists make the cardinal error of “...commit[ting] the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1389787/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;see this book review by David Schaal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mereological fallacy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  the tendency to ascribe to the brain psychological concepts that only  make sense when ascribed to whole animals.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognitive neuroscientists (&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;gasp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) are actually Cartesian dualists! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Philosophical+Foundations+of+Neuroscience-p-9781405108386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bennett and Hacker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“&lt;i&gt;For the characteristic form of explanation in contemporary cognitive  neuroscience consists in ascribing psychological attributes to the brain  and its parts in order to explain the possession of  psychological attributes and the exercise (and deficiencies in the  exercise) of cognitive powers by human beings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;” (p. 3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that optimistic note, the four panelists gave their introductory remarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/lila-davachi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Lila Davachi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; asked, “what is the value of the work we do?” Uh, well, that's a difficult question. Are we improving society in some way? Adding to a collective body of knowledge that may (or may not) be the key to explaining behavior and curing disease? Although still difficult, Dr. Davachi posed an easier question, “what are your goals?” To describe behavior, predict behavior (correlation), explain behavior (causation), change behavior (manipulation)? But “what counts as an explanation?” I don't think anyone really answered that question. Instead she mentioned the recurring themes of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;levels of analysis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;(without invoking Marr by name), &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;emergent properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (the flock of birds analogy), and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bridging laws&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (that link levels of analysis). The correct level of analysis is/are the one(s) that advance your goals. But what to do about “level chauvinism” in contemporary neuroscience? This question was raised again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Jennifer Groh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; jumped right out of the gate with this motif. There are competing narratives in neuroscience we can call the electrode level (recording from neurons) vs. the neuroimaging level (recording large-scale brain activations or “network” interactions based on an indirect measure of neural activity). They make different assumptions about what is significant or worth studying. I found this interesting, since her lab is the only one that records from actual neurons. But there are ever more reductionist scientists who always throw stones at those above them. Neurobiologists (at the electrode level and below) are operating at ever more granular levels of detail, walking away from cognitive neuroscience entirely (who wants to be a dualist, anyway?). I knew exactly where she was going with this: the field is being driven by techniques, doing experiments merely because you can (cough — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/optogenetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;HOW TO PUBLISH IN NATURE&quot;&gt;OPTOGENETICS&lt;/a&gt; — cough). Speaking for myself, however, the fact that neurobiologists can control mouse behavior by manipulating highly specific populations of cells raises the specter of insecurity... certain areas of research might not be considered “neuroscience” any more by a bulk of practitioners in the field (just attend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Society for Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(3) &lt;a href=&quot;http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/people/faculty.catherine-alexandra-hartley.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Catherine Hartley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; continued with the recurring theme that we need both &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;prediction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;explanation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to reach our ultimate goal of understanding behavior. Is a prediction system enough? No, we must know how the black box functions by studying “latent processes” such as representation and computation. But what if we're wrong about representations, I thought? The view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@PsychScientists&lt;/a&gt; immediately came to mind. Sorry to interrupt Dr. Hartley, but here's Golonka and Wilson in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/058925v3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecological Representations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mainstream cognitive science and neuroscience both rely heavily on the notion of representation in order to explain the full range of our behavioral repertoire. The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties ... While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called 'representation-hungry' problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on to invoke &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology#Gibson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James J Gibson's&lt;/a&gt; ecological information functions. But I can already hear Dr. Poeppel's colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GregoryHickok&quot;&gt;@GregoryHickok&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/568899227822252033&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;others on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; debating with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/733190148930850816&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@PsychScientists&lt;/a&gt;. Oh. Wait. Debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; that I so rudely interrupted, Dr. Hartley gave some excellent examples of theories that link psychology and neuroscience. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yorku.ca/eye/trichrom.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trichromatic theory of color vision&lt;/a&gt; — the finding that three independent channels convey color information — was based on psychophysics in the early-mid 1800s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young–Helmholtz theory&lt;/a&gt;). This was over a century before the discovery of cones in the retina, which are sensitive to three different wavelengths. She also mentioned the more frequently used examples of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Tolman/Maps/maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tolman's cognitive maps&lt;/a&gt; (which predated &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cognitivemap.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel&quot;&gt;The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by 30 years) and error-driven reinforcement learning (Bush–Mosteller [&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;6&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-23&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-23-2&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;7&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-24&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-24-2&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] and Rescorla–Wagner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;both of which predate&lt;/a&gt; knowledge of dopamine neurons). To generate good linking hypotheses in the present, we need to construct formal models that make quantitative predictions (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;generative models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(4) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/sharon-thompson-schill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gave a brief introduction with no slides, which is good because this post has gotten very long. For this reason, I won't cover the panel discussion and the Q&amp;amp;A period, which continued the same themes outlined above and expanded on “predictivism” (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;predictive chauvinism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and data-driven neuroscience) and raised new points like the value (or not) of introspection in science. When the Cognitive Neuroscience Society updates their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg/videos&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, I'll let you know. Another source is the excellent live tweeting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2019&amp;amp;src=typd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@VukovicNikola&lt;/a&gt;. But to wrap up, Dr. Thompson-Schill asked members of the audience whether they consider themselves psychologists or neuroscientists. Most identified as neuroscientists (which is a relative term, I think). Although more people will talk to you on a plane if you say you're a psychologist, “neuroscience is easy, psychology is hard,” a surprising take-home message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debating Debates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've actually wanted to see more debating at the CNS meeting. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Society for the Neurobiology of Language&lt;/a&gt; (SNL) often features a lively debate at their conferences.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Several examples are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2016:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/2017/debate-2016/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Debate: The Consequences of Bilingualism for Cognitive and Neural Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen Bialystok &amp;amp; Manuel Carreiras &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2014:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20141116173834/http://www.neurolang.org/panelist-2014/&quot;&gt;What counts as neurobiology of language – a debate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Steve Small, Angela Friederici&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2013: &lt;/b&gt;Panel Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235112/http://www.neurolang.org/thursday-discussion-panel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The role of semantic information in reading aloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Coltheart vs Mark Seidenberg &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2012:&lt;/b&gt; Panel Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/2017/2012-sessions-events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;What is the role of the insula in speech and language?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina F.

On one side is Nancy Kanwisher of MIT, who first proposed that the fusiform gyrus was specifically designed to recognize faces–and faces alone–based on her findings using a magnetic resonance imaging device. Then, Isabel Gauthier, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt, talked about her research, showing that the fusiform gyrus lights up when looking at many different kinds of objects people are skilled at recognizing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for keeping this article on their site after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is the color-word Stroop task: name the font color, rather than read the word.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;BLUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; elicits conflict between the overlearned response (&quot;read the word &lt;i&gt;blue&lt;/i&gt;&quot;) and the task requirment (say &quot;&lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt;&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aka the  the now-obligatory David Poeppel session on BIG STUFF.

These include procurement system integration, SSO integration, and file storage integration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Procurement system integration allows the buying experience for researchers to remain the same as their current processes and provide a seamless punch-out catalog into Science Exchange. All PO generations, change orders, payments, and invoicing will be streamlined and automated via the Science Exchange platform and with the client’s existing approval workflows in place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An SSO integration with Science Exchange allows researchers to seamlessly access their Science Exchange account and offers all of the benefits of SSO on productivity, strong password security, and quick adoption of new company adopted tools. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers currently need to manage a separate process: set up folders with each new project, give access to external vendors, and manage keeping files up to date. File storage integration with Science Exchange removes this process and automatically copies all files uploaded to a Science Exchange order to a cloud file storage location of the client’s choosing. This allows researchers to eliminate a manual process and ensures that external project files are maintained in a compliant manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The age of social media has opened up exciting opportunities for researchers to investigate people’s emotional states on a massive scale. For example, one study found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1878&quot;&gt;tweets contain more positive emotional words in the morning&lt;/a&gt;, which was interpreted as showing that most people are in a better mood at that time of day.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of this line of research is that our word choices reflect our psychological states – that if someone uses more positive or negative emotional words, this is a good indication that they are actually experiencing those emotions. But now a new study has thrown a spanner in the works, finding that – for spoken language at least – this assumption might not hold up. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/8fpjn/&quot;&gt;preprint posted recently on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jessie Sun and colleagues found that emotion-related words do not in fact provide a good indication of a person’s mood, although there may be other sets of words that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36796&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun’s team asked 185 American university students to wear a recording device for a week, which recorded a 30 second snippet of sound every 9.5 minutes. Four times per day, the participants also completed a survey via text message measuring the positive and negative emotions they had experienced over the previous hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team ended up with a whopping 150,000 recordings, which research assistants transcribed over the course of two years, weeding out clips which contained no speech or just a few words. They then scored each recording according to how many positive and negative emotion words it contained (like “sweet” or “hurt”), by running the text through an analysis programme called the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count , which contains dictionaries of words associated with different topics. Finally, the team averaged the scores for all clips from the same three-hour period surrounding each questionnaire, ending up with 1,579 language-based emotion measurements that they could directly compare to participants’ self-reported mood.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that – contrary to the assumptions of some past studies – the number of positive and negative emotional words was not associated with participants’ actual mood. “Our findings suggest that researchers should not assume that fluctuations in … [the use of emotional words] … can be used as a proxy for subjective emotion experience, at least for spoken language”, the authors write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the recordings did contain some emotional information: the research assistants’ assessment of the speaker’s emotions, based on listening to the recordings, &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; associated with participants’ rating of their own mood. The authors suggest that the human raters were picking up on non-verbal cues relating to emotion – things like intonation and volume – that the programme itself was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an exploratory analysis, the authors also examined whether any other sets of words unrelated to emotion could predict participants’ mood. They found that greater use of words related to socialising, like “you” or “we”, was associated with experiencing more positive emotion, while use of maths words, like “minus” and “number”, was related to less positive emotion.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, these associations were weak, so may not be useful measures of emotion, say the authors.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other possible explanations for the null results in the study, which the authors acknowledge. It could be that a person’s use of emotion-related words taps into an aspect of emotion that also isn’t captured by self-report questionnaires&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;– perhaps one that participants themselves aren’t consciously aware of. Alternatively, the dictionaries themselves may not always reflect how people use words: for example, the word “pretty” appears in the positive dictionary, but could be used in a negative context (e.g. “it was pretty terrible”). But even taking into account these limitations, the new study demonstrates the importance of checking the validity of tools in psychology research, to make sure that they are actually measuring what we think they are measuring. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: 10 brain books you should read in 2019</title>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/10-brain-books-you-should-read-in-2019/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5858 size-large aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10brainbooks-1024x576.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s on your “to-read” list this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few books that I’ve read (or plan to in 2019) chosen based on research rigour, chosen, publication date (the last year or two) and practical application. In other words: these books synthesise the most compelling brain science and smart ideas emerging from the research lab and make it relevant for our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun exploring big topics like how our emotions are created, the importance of gut health, the latest on habit formation, understanding the teenage brain, epigenetics, mindfulness, depression and anxiety and the female brain. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Changer-Good-Mental-Health-ebook/dp/B07K9LZPNL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=brain+changer&amp;amp;qid=1551238192&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot;&gt;Brain Changer&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Felice Jacka&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is our brain and mental health affected by what we eat? Australian scientist, Felice Jacka uncovers the link between obesity and depression, how gut health impacts brain health and how a Mediterranean diet can keep our brains healthy as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Mindfulness-Astonishing-Science-Everyday-ebook/dp/B074FCMSJB&quot;&gt;The Neuroscience of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Stan Rodski&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the proof that mindfulness works? Discover the neuroscience behind mindfulness as Dr Rodski explains how being in the moment can lower stress, increase energy levels, build resilience and protect us from a range of life-threatening illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Brain-Gene-Psychotherapy-Integration-John-Arden/dp/0393711846&quot;&gt;Mind-Brain-Gene&lt;/a&gt; by Dr John Arden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Arden explores the fascinating world of epigenetics, the immune system and mental health. He takes us on a fascinating journey into the mind-brain-body feedback loops, showing how they influence mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Ourselves-Secret-Teenage-Brain/dp/1610397312/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3I2GBII41G4R7&amp;amp;keywords=sarah+jayne+blakemore&amp;amp;qid=1551238354&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=sarah+jayne+bl%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C363&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Inventing Ourselves&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakemore, often credited with pioneering adolescent neurosciences, takes us on a tour through the groundbreaking science behind the enigmatic, but crucial, brain developments of adolescence and how those translate into teenage behaviour. Blakemore demystifies this period of development, outlining what makes the teenage brain unique and why mental illness can develop in these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Connections-Uncovering-Depression-Unexpected/dp/163286830X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=johann+hari&amp;amp;qid=1551238458&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-2&quot;&gt;Lost Connections&lt;/a&gt; by Johann Hari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his bold and inspiring book, Hari goes on a quest to explore nine different causes of depression and anxiety including disconnection from meaningful work, other people, the natural world and hope. He challenges what we have believed to be true about depression and anxiety and their unexpected solution – reconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=james+clear&amp;amp;qid=1551238482&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/a&gt; by James Clear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we create habits that stick? In his book, Clear explores the neuroscience of habit formation, along with proven principles in biology and psychology to offer an effective system for change. According to Clear, it’s the small changes made consistently which compound into life-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Emotions-Made-Lisa-Barrett/dp/1328915433/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=How+Emotions+Are+Made&amp;amp;qid=1551238746&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;How Emotions Are Made&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrett shakes up what we have previously thought true about how emotions are created. She challenges the idea that emotions are automatic and hard-wired in certain parts of the brain, using the latest in emotion science to show how emotion is actually created from a complex interplay between our brain, body and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Classroom-Jared-Horvath/dp/1138649643/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=jared+horvath&amp;amp;qid=1551238526&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1-fkmrnull&quot;&gt;From the Laboratory to the Classroom&lt;/a&gt; by editors Jared Cooney Horvath, Jason M. Lodge and John Hattie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we applying what we know about the neuroscience of learning in the classroom? Horvath’s book combines theory and practice exceptionally well, offering useful strategies based on the science of learning, motivation, attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Every-Note-Played-Lisa-Genova/dp/147671780X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Q5DU80KX7ZID&amp;amp;keywords=lisa+genova&amp;amp;qid=1551238993&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=lisa+gen%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C371&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Every Note Ever Played&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Lisa Genova&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From neuroscientist and author of &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt;, Genova’s latest novel is compelling and thought-provoking. She explores what it means to be truly alive, looking at the way neurological conditions impact identity and relationships. Genova is gifted at bringing to life the struggles experienced by those living with a neurological condition and those who love and care for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Womens-Brain-Book-neuroscience-happiness/dp/073363852X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=womens+brain+book&amp;amp;qid=1551238336&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-2&quot;&gt;The Women’s Brain Book&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Sarah McKay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, how could I not include my own book on this list for must-reads of 2019! My book takes you on a journey through the female lifespan (from womb to tomb) and explores how how brains are shaped by the lives we live, and in turn how how lives are shaped by our neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any books I missed or you think should be added to the list?  Leave me a comment below. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: The compatibility of STEM and spirituality</title>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/28/the-compatibility-of-stem-and-spirituality/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Having been raised Catholic, I have a confession to make: I have found it difficult to make room for spirituality and religion in a STEM-focused society. Not in my personal life exactly, but in my community and conversations. I think it’s partly because people have such varying conceptions of spiritual life, God, or gods. And because we don’t talk about it freely, when someone does bring up anything related to this subject, it’s easy to become immediately wary: is this person trying to convert me or take my money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a third option: what if that person is trying to tell you about a powerful experience they had, which they cannot fully explain using known, familiar concepts or which seems to be at least partly outside of human control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, for a lot of people, it’s actually something closer to this third idea that motivates us to talk about spirituality and God. And that may be the key to why it’s hard to discuss these things in certain STEM communities. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are about curiosity, innovation, achievement – rewarding for sure – but they are also often about control and precision, human definitions and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, if you need to know that something is conceptually possible with a certain regard for grace and beauty, you may be a mathematician. If you need to know something well enough to be confident that it will work reliably and consistently – and that you can fix it when it goes wrong – you might be an engineer or doctor. If you need to examine every little detail, control every factor and condition, and measure everything precisely and then report your findings in a strictly structured format, you are probably a hard scientist. Given each of these approaches to inquiry and the effect they may have on your world view, your conception of God is likely to be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also still feel that sense of wonder and awe that some folks ascribe to religion and spirituality. Except, instead of feeling that sense when you enter a religious venue or contemplate a starry sky, perhaps you feel that sense in the infinite combinations of factors that your experimental setup can produce. And I’m not speaking cynically of electrical noise or undetermined behavioral influences that plague experimental scientists. I mean the vast space of possibility associated with randomness, Brownian motion, genetic mutations and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that one acceptable definition of God to say God is in the things we don’t understand, in the concepts and people that we value but have not figured out. In this way, the concept of God is compatible with a fully formed and intricate understanding of biology, astronomy, natural history, and human relations. Being a generally warm-hearted and optimistic person, I also think of God as a force for love, growth, and connection between persons, nature, and other living things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the concept of God or spirituality, there is also the concept of religion: the specific ways in which we worship or view God. Sometimes it may seem that science and religion are incompatible, or are less compatible than science and spirituality. However, the domains of each are largely separate. To the extent that they overlap, it is worth exploring how each can benefit the other. For example, can science or medicine instruct us as to how to safely heal spiritual injuries? Or can religious traditions and rituals point us to some fundamental biological truth or natural observation? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/sunday/science-religion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Perhaps so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have actually experienced the healing of a spiritual injury in myself by someone with a scientific background. It had not been an experience I was expecting, nor one that I had even considered possible. But it happened and was a remarkable experience that felt very intense and difficult to describe to most people. After it happened, I felt quite strongly that something about my spiritual state had been altered. I have often contemplated the scientific basis for the sensations and feelings that occurred in me during this healing process. I do believe there are some, although I am unsure whether it is wise and necessary to delve far into the intricate details of my brain state, or whether that endeavor would be akin to chasing the biological basis for free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this post, I am becoming aware of just how little I discuss anything religious or spiritual. I feel that it is an awkward conversation to have, mostly because I assume everyone rushes to judgment about a religious speaker, as I do sometimes. I think the problem is also because I am out of practice discussing religion and spirituality. It is not a conversation that I hear or participate in often. I find myself hesitant to bring it up, not knowing where other people stand. And I feel uncomfortable to bring up a topic that almost no one else in my current environment discusses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy – and wrong – to pin my dilemma on my STEM community. This was difficult for me even among some members of my church community growing up, during university, and after university, people with whom I supposedly share a similar worldview, spiritual outlook, and religious foundation. In an article noting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/sunday/talk-god-sprituality-christian.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the difficulty of talking about God&lt;/a&gt; in this modern and busy world, author Jonathan Merritt observed that the decline in our spiritual vocabulary and proficiency has real consequences for the spiritual life of the community. Those consequences are negative and undesirable for the community, whether or not you believe in spiritual power or religion. And so, out of respect for the humanity and potential of our communities, I believe it is worth exploring how we can include a vocabulary of spirituality and religion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/vocation-college-higher-ed.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academia generally and STEM fields specifically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
