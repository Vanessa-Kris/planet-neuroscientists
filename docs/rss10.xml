	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXIX) The free energy principle</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxix-the-free-energy-principle/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The free energy principle is the theory that the brain manipulates a probabilistic generative model of its sensory inputs, which it tries to optimize by either changing the model (learning) or changing the inputs (action) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20-%20a%20rough%20guide%20to%20the%20brain.pdf&quot;&gt;Friston 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20A%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf&quot;&gt;Friston 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The “free energy” is related to the error between predictions and actual inputs, or “surprise”, which the organism wants to minimize. It has a more precise mathematical formulation, but the conceptual issues I want to discuss here do not depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it can be seen as an extension of the Bayesian brain hypothesis that accounts for action in addition to perception. It shares the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxviiithe-bayesian-brain/&quot;&gt;conceptual problems of the Bayesian brain hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, namely that it focuses on statistical uncertainty, inferring variables of a model (called “causes”) when the challenge is to build and manipulate the structure of the model. It also shares issues with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-brief-critique-of-predictive-coding/&quot;&gt;predictive coding&lt;/a&gt; concept, namely that there is a conflation between a technical sense of “prediction” (expectation of the future signal) and a broader sense that is more ecologically relevant (if I do X, then Y will happen). In my view, these are the main issues with the free energy principle. Here I will focus on an additional issue that is specific of the free energy principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific interest of the free energy principle lies in its formulation of action. It resonates with a very important psychological theory called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cognitive dissonance theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That theory says that you try to avoid dissonance between facts and your system of beliefs, by either changing the beliefs in a small way or avoiding the facts. When there is a dissonant fact, you generally don’t throw your entire system of beliefs: rather, you alter the interpretation of the fact (think of political discourse or in fact, scientific discourse). Another strategy is to avoid the dissonant facts: for example, to read newspapers that tend to have the same opinions as yours. So there is some support in psychology for the idea that you act so as to minimize surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the free energy principle acknowledges the circularity of action and perception. However, it is quite difficult to make it account for a large part of behavior. A large part of behavior is directed towards goals; for example, to get food and sex. The theory anticipates this criticism and proposes that goals are ingrained in priors. For example, you expect to have food. So, for your state to match your expectations, you need to seek food. This is the theory’s solution to the so-called “dark room problem” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347222/&quot;&gt;Friston et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;): if you want to minimize surprise, why not shut off stimulation altogether and go to the closest dark room? Solution: you are not expecting a dark room, so you are not going there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a concrete example to show that this solution does not work. There are two kinds of stimuli: food, and no food. I have two possible actions: to seek food, or to sit and do nothing. If I do nothing, then with 100% probability, I will see no food. If I seek food, then with, say, 20% probability, I will see food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say this is the world in which I live. What does the free energy principle tell us? To minimize surprise, it seems clear that I should sit: I am certain to not see food. No surprise at all. The proposed solution is that you have a prior expectation to see food. So to minimize the surprise, you should put yourself into a situation where you might see food, ie to seek food. This seems to work. However, if there is any learning at all, then you will quickly observe that the probability of seeing food is actually 20%, and your expectations should be adjusted accordingly. Also, I will also observe that between two food expeditions, the probability to see food is 0%. Once this has been observed, surprise is minimal when I do not seek food. So, I die of hunger. It follows that the free energy principle does not survive Darwinian competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, either there is no learning at all and the free energy principle is just a way of calling predefined actions “priors”; or there is learning, but then it doesn’t account for goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea to act so as to minimize surprise resonates with some aspects of psychology, like cognitive dissonance theory, but that does not constitute a complete theory of mind, except possibly of the depressed mind. See for example the experience of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; (as in surfing): you seek a situation that is controllable but sufficiently challenging that it engages your entire attention; in other words, you voluntarily expose yourself to a (moderate amount of) surprise; in any case certainly not a minimum amount of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Crap. &lt;i&gt;Merde. Ibn sharmoota&lt;/i&gt;.* Swear words exist in most cultures (Japan is a notable exception), and many of us use them so casually and so frequently that by the time children start school, they have, according to one count, acquired a profanity bank of 30 to 40 words. (My own seven-year-old loves to whisper “fricking” in a friend’s ear, making them both giggle guiltily. My only defence is that he certainly didn’t get that one from me…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since even words like “fuck” are used conversationally, at least in the US and UK, surely they’ve lost the power to trigger a negative response in a listener – especially as far as younger adults are concerned? Not according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X18758143&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Language and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;. Melanie DeFrank and Patricia Kahlbaugh, at Southern Connecticut State University, found that teenagers who swear casually were judged by college students as being less intelligent and less trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33600&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrank and Kahlbaugh recruited 138 students, including 101 women. The participants first completed a questionnaire asking them to rate the offensiveness of 10 swear words. (The words in order of most to least offensive, according to the participants’ ratings, were: bitch, fuck, bastard, shit, ass, jerk, screw, butt, crap and dang.) The participants also estimated how often they used and heard these kinds of words. While 17 per cent said they used between zero and five daily, just over 20 per cent reported using more than 21 every day. Thirteen per cent said they heard between zero and five, but 20 per cent reported hearing more than 21 daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the participants read two purported conversations between two 15-year-olds. They were asked to imagine that they were overhearing these conversations, and in each case, they had to rate the first speaker on overall impression, intelligence, trustworthiness, sociability, politeness and likability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialogues were presented as being either between two males, two females, or a male and a female. Also, either one or both speakers used swear words from the list, or neither of them did. In all other respects, the conversations were exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an extract from a female-female conversation in which both parties swore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “Hey, what’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “Hey, how are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “Good. Just about to head to class. Can’t be late. You know how he is. He’ll bitch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “I hate that shit. You can’t even be a second late before they get on to you about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “I know, and they give us so much work. I already have so much shit to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “Me too. It’s not even funny. I have like three fucking tests coming up in the same week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrank and Kahlbaugh found that, overall, as well as being judged to be less intelligent and less trustworthy, both males and females who swore were considered to be less likeable, more offensive and more aggressive. Also, speakers (male or female) who swore during a mixed-gender conversation were rated as being less sociable. And males who used swear words in conversation with females were rated as being more offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was despite the fact that just under half of the participants said that they did not consider the swearing version of the dialogue to be “profane”. Even the swear words that the students perceived to be most offensive – bitch and fuck – they still only rated midway on the offensiveness scale, on average, and some students rated them as completely inoffensive. “Despite people not considering the… language offensive, they are still affected by it and use it to judge others, suggesting a subliminal effect,” DeFrank and Kahlbaugh write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perhaps worth stressing that findings from a group of college students in Connecticut who thought they were judging teenage strangers don’t necessarily apply generally. But since first impressions do matter – and can last – perhaps we should all be more careful about casual swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, “people have become more desensitized to certain swears and even expect them at times,” the researchers note. “Having said that, there is still a language bias. Word choices matter, even when we think they do not or when we think they should not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X18758143&quot;&gt;Language Choice Matters: When Profanity Affects How People Are Judged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Merde – French for “shit”; Ibn sharmoota – transliteration of the Arabic for “son of a bitch”&lt;/p&gt;

Differentially expressed genes in cancer resistance with regulated target genes. Upregulated and downregulated factors are depicted in red and blue, respectively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Images by Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Fabian V. Filipp. Used with permission. CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hidden layer of regulation selects surviving cancer cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely established that cancers develop when cells mutate. However, resistance to therapy might go &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elx001&quot;&gt;beyond cancer mutations&lt;/a&gt;. Though chemotherapy might kill most of the cancer, tiny populations of drug-resistant cancer cells manage to survive and propagate. Unlike the more familiar case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, where genetic mutations give rise to resistance, many adaptations in treatment-resistant cancers are not the result of mutation. The DNA may stay the same, but cancer cells adapt to therapy and outsmart the drugs by switching their gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such adaptations do not affect the DNA itself, a hidden layer of regulation controlling the activity of genes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15681&quot;&gt;epigenetic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-017-0173-2&quot;&gt;metabolic signals&lt;/a&gt; — help cancer cells survive. By targeting this hidden program, it may be possible to overcome deadly cancer resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0554-1&quot;&gt;new research now published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Systems Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cancer systems biology team of Professor Fabian V. Filipp at the University of California Merced introduces a cellular model of cancer resistance. Under the selective pressure of mitogen activated kinase inhibitors cells are completely rewired yet manage to escape the anti-cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probing melanoma genomes reveals new targets and challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients respond very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how cancer becomes treatment resistant, it is useful to compare pathways in treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant cancers such as melanomas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857&quot;&gt;Melanoma&lt;/a&gt; is a cancer that originates in melanocytes, the cells that produce the skin-color pigment melanin and is usually caused by UV damage. Though not the most common form of skin cancer, it is the most aggressive. And if it’s not caught and treated early, it’s also among the deadliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UV damage gives rise to point mutations — changes in a single letter of the 3 billion letter human genome. These mutations can &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2016.01.003&quot;&gt;interfere with signals&lt;/a&gt; that tell cells when to grow and divide and when to stop. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857&quot;&gt;Mutations in a protein called BRAF&lt;/a&gt;, a major signaling regulator, cause growth signals to be stuck in the “on” position and drive cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scientists have managed to come up with drugs that target and turn off aberrant BRAF signaling, cancer cells are clever and learn to adapt to these BRAF-inhibitors. Today, many patients respond to targeted treatment against BRAF signaling very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10074&quot; style=&quot;width: 1010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10074&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/researchers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Professor Fabian V. Filipp with his team working on precision targeting of malignant melanoma at UC Merced Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory. High-throughput screening in combination with systems biology analysis identifies master regulators and new drug targets of therapy resistance in malignant melanoma.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Photo by Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Fabian V. Filipp. Used with permission. CC BY-NC-SA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewiring of gene expression and metabolism to bypass drug blockage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma is able circumvent BRAF inhibitors not by changing the genes themselves, but by changing gene activity, making them more or less active. Some of the genes with reduced activity were in the same or related signaling pathway as BRAF, the mutated protein that gave rise to the cancer and the main target of chemotherapy. The resistant cells managed to evolve in a way to bypass the signaling blockade or come up with a new way to maintain proliferation. Genes with increased activity were in metabolic pathways that allowed cancer cells to bypass BRAF altogether and continue to grow and divide. Cancer cells had essentially figured out how to survive by rewiring their metabolism in response to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems biology predicts adaptive responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daunting as this may sound, it actually offers hope to scientists and clinicians who want to treat chemo-resistant cancers. Non-genomic drug adaptation can be accomplished reproducibly in cultured cells, and combination therapies that block adaptive mechanisms in vitro have shown promise in improving rates and durability of response. Thus, better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer models in combination with systems biology will pave the way for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systems biology approach reveals that signaling pathways undergo major rewiring at the transcriptional level while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of such transcriptional plasticity is dysregulation at the level of different upstream master regulators, while maintaining similar effector genes. Combination therapies including targeted approaches and immune checkpoint inhibition are promising and rapidly improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10081&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-10081&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/180404_Filipp_Systems_Biology_Cancer_Rsistance_Screen-1024x640.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Cellular models of therapy resistance allow for screens of combination therapies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Images by Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Fabian V. Filipp. Used with permission. CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these therapies to show durable, progression-free successes in the clinical setting, adaptation mechanisms of treatment resistances need to be understood. Cellular models in combination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.4103/1477-3163.115423&quot;&gt;systems biology analyses&lt;/a&gt; across epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes provide insight into how non-genomic drug adaptation is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing efforts are focused on utilizing the established &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/srep32611&quot;&gt;preclinical models&lt;/a&gt; to overcome drug adaptation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10555-017-9662-4&quot;&gt;precision medicine&lt;/a&gt; profiling of cancer patients. Over time, a better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Modernization of mortuary practice and grief</title>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/536790534/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern western mortuary practices are characterized by the professionalization of the management and presentation of the corpse. These practices serve as a stark contrast to those in traditional societies across the world and those throughout history. Changes to how we treat and dispose of the dead are such that industrialized societies have become outliers on the spectrum of the world’s cultures. Modernity has afforded us with a more efficient system for handling the dead, yet research suggests that these alterations may be negatively impacting long-term grief outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death. Today, bereaved individuals in developed nations rarely participate in the ritualized preparation of the corpse, and, indeed, have minimal exposure to cues of death of any sort. Death specialists, such as mortuary cosmetologists and morticians, now wash, dress, and embalm the dead, amongst &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342958/What-really-happens-die-Behind-scenes-funeral-homes-America-dead-prepared-final-resting-place.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other invasive procedures&lt;/a&gt;. They have replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ideas.ted.com/11-fascinating-funeral-traditions-from-around-the-globe/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many traditional rituals&lt;/a&gt; of handling of the dead person by family and other community members. As a result, most people do not have the opportunity to see or interact with their loved one in a natural state of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human relationships require huge investments and generate massive benefits, and we are not willing to let go of them unless we have unequivocal evidence that the person is dead. This is one reason why it is common for bereaved individuals who have not seen their loved-one’s corpses, such as death through tragedy, to demand to see the body or evidence that the person died and why &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.who.int/hac/techguidance/management_of_dead_bodies.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the World Health Organization recommend it&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, any suggestions that the person may still be alive weighs heavy on our minds. We typically use cues of agency and appearances to determine if a person is alive, or dead. If the person moves, or if they look like a living person, then we assume that he or she is alive. Oftentimes people comment that the dead person looks as though he or she were simply sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the evolutionary sciences suggests that this tendency to assume an agent is alive was once adaptive and is now instinctual. For instance, assuming that a predator was dead when it was in fact alive would have been detrimental to our survival, so as a general rule of thumb, people are more receptive to cues of life than cues of death. When this basic tendency is coupled with the motivation to want to continue the relationship with the dead person, it takes only minimal cues to convince us that the person is still around. Often there is a conflict between what the bereaved person consciously believes and how they reason momentarily, such as a widow thinking that the sound of footsteps on the stairs is her deceased husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people now opt for a closed casket for their loved-ones, and even if they do see the corpse, it most often follows complex professional preparation of the corpse aimed at minimizing cues of death. The “disneyfication of death” is common practice, where the deceased are artificially manipulated to resemble their appearance during life. Often photographs depicting the person when they were alive are placed on top of the casket or with a funerary order of service. With the rise of social media, such as in memorandum Facebook pages enable the community to endlessly revisit the person when he or she was alive with the click of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers have shown that ritualization helps us to feel more in control of life events and they also provide us with an opportunity to receive social support from the community, which also has positive mental health benefits. Yet much of the ritualization involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://gizmodo.com/the-morbid-art-of-making-dead-bodies-beautiful-1221696867&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preparing the corpse for disposal has been given to professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now generally accepted in the clinical literature that long-term outcomes are better for those who view the body of a loved one, as doing so is thought to help people come to terms with the death. Naturalistic data suggests that even in traumatic circumstances, viewing the body of a loved one may increase anxiety and distress in the short term, but is associated with less distress in the longer term. Conversely, not seeing the body is associated with more difficult, prolonged grief. Health care professionals often observe that spending time both viewing and touching the body of a deceased loved one is conducive to better outcomes. Grief is one of the most intensely stressful experiences faced by humans and modern practices may be retarding the process.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/536771704/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Great leaders show composure during stressful situations. But remaining cool and collected in times of crisis is easier said than done, partly due to our own behavioral patterns. Allowing ourselves to become tethered to a particular agenda or resolution puts us at risk for increased stress and diminished communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open to personal change is the first step to improving conflict-resolution habits. Self-management allows leaders to more effectively manage conflicts. Mantras (or internal chants) are a great way to self-manage: these small reminders can help us control our emotions and, in turn, any conflicts that arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With insights from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-you-dont-know-about-leadership-but-probably-should-9780190620820&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What You Don’t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/change-9780190866853&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change: What Really Leads to Lasting Personal Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we put together a list of mantras for effective conflict-resolution. Take a look at the infographic below to see how you might better handle difficult conversations—both in and out of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that we learn better when taught via our preferred modality or “learning style” – such as visually, orally, or by doing – is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;not supported by evidence&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Some advocates of the learning styles approach argue that the reason for the lack of evidence to date is that students do so much of their learning outside of class. According to this view, psychologists have failed to find evidence for learning styles because they’ve focused too narrowly on whether it is beneficial to have congruence between teaching style and preferred learning style. Instead, they say psychologists should look for the beneficial effects of students studying outside of class in a manner that is consistent with their learning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Anatomical Sciences Education&lt;/em&gt;, a pair of researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine have conducted just such an investigation with hundreds of undergrads. Once again however the findings do not support the learning styles concept, reinforcing its reputation among mainstream psychologists as little more than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/&quot;&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33559&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of term, Polly Husmann and Valerie Dean O’Loughlin asked hundreds of undergrads on an anatomy course (which involved lectures and practical lab classes) to take one of the most popular online learning styles surveys, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/&quot;&gt;the VARK&lt;/a&gt;. Taken by millions of people worldwide, the VARK categorises students according to how much they prefer to learn visually, via auditory information, through reading and writing, or through kinaesthetics (by doing or by practical example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VARK website also offers study tips based on your supposed preferred learning style(s). The researchers encouraged their student participants to take the survey and to adopt the study practices consistent with their dominant learning style. Later in the term, the researchers surveyed them about the methods they’d actually used when studying outside of class, to see if they used methods in line with their supposed dominant learning style. Finally, the researchers accessed the students’ end-of-year grades to see if there was any association between grade performance, dominant learning style, and/or studying outside of class in a way consistent with one’s dominant learning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are bad news for advocates of the learning styles concept. Student grade performance was not correlated in any meaningful way with their dominant learning style or with any learning style(s) they scored highly on. Also, while most students (67 per cent) actually failed to study in a way consistent with their supposedly preferred learning style, those who did study in line with their dominant style did not achieve a better grade in their anatomy class than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, there were specific study strategies, such as practising microscope work and using lecture notes, that were associated with better grade performance, regardless of students’ learning style. Other activities, such as using flash cards, were associated with poorer performance, perhaps because they were a sign of learning by rote rather than deeper learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husmann and O’Loughlin don’t pull any punches in their conclusion. Their findings, they write – especially when considered in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; – “provide strong evidence that instructors and students should not be promoting the concept of learning styles for studying and/or for teaching interventions. Thus, the adage of ‘I can’t learn subject X because I am a visual learner’ should be put to rest once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777&quot;&gt;Another nail in the coffin for learning styles? Disparities among undergraduate anatomy students’ study strategies, class performance, and reported VARK learning styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Buckle up and enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.
Dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, dreams, the most intriguing, mysterious and exciting part of sleep. How much we know about it? You guessed it -- not enough to be sure of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s skip all the Freudian “wishes of the unconscious” (it is a blog about science after all…) and get straight to the facts. 
Some researchers think that there is a link between newly made memories, their consolidation and the formation of dreams.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04288&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One hypothesis is that when elements from a new memory appear in dreams it gets easier for the brain to save them as they get replayed in their original state (=you “perceive” the memories again). There are studies showing that in the morning, after dreaming about newly learnt stuff, people are better at recalling this stuff than people who did not dream about it.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04288&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the exact brain regions responsible for dream generation remain elusive, in a couple of recent studies scientists have made some progress in identifying which brain part makes us dream. It turns out that the parieto-occipital region, working for mental imagery and processing of all your perceptions during the day, is a hot zone for dreaming during the nighttime.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5462120/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And if enjoy your nighttime adventures (Jesus, that came out wrong), you should take really good care of this region -- studies show that brain damage affecting it leads to the loss of the dream experiences.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21227155&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Moreover, the scientists looked into what brain areas are activated while you dream of certain stuff. For that, they created five rough categories (thinking/perceiving, speech, faces, movement and any kind of a spatial setting) and found that when people dream of a certain category the brain area which is responsible for it in the waking state was also significantly more active than the others. Meaning that the “perception” of specific information activates the same brain parts, no matter, real or dreamt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.
What can go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with everything in life, sleep can go wrong -- and there are many ways for it to do so: from the once in a while insomnia we are all familiar with to the incurable “fatal family insomnia”, a disease which prevents you from falling asleep at all, resulting in hallucinations, dementia and death. Woah. Intense. But let’s start with something less heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are insomnias -- when you cannot fall asleep,  hypersomnia -- when you sleep too much, parasomnias -- when you display abnormal behavior during sleep and some others (such as sleep apnea when you have troubles breathing during sleep). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomnia can be caused by a myriad of factors -- you might just be too nervous before an exam tomorrow, or you keep going through this stupid thing you said five years ago (or it is a side effect of another medical condition you have). However, sometimes your brain just sabotages your sleep -- research suggests that the brain of people with primary insomnia (that is, insomnia not connected to any other condition) might be lacking a certain neurotransmitter, GABA, which acts as a “brake fluid” of the brain. It was shown that adults with chronic insomnia have 30% less GABA than the average population.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sleep/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=27298&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Consequently the brain is unable to shut down the waking signals, leaving the brain hyperactivated. Moreover, it was found that these patients also have some problems with their brain connectivity -- the connections to and from thalamus, the region of the brain that regulates tons of stuff, among others consciousness, sleep and alertness, were weakened.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2016152038&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not clear yet whether the disrupted connections are the cause or the consequence of insomnia but at least it’s shedding some light on this mysterious disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersomnias, on another hand, make you sleepy all the time. Narcolepsy, a disease when you are excessively sleepy and uncontrollably fall asleep during the day time, is a prime example of a hypersomnia. It was found that people with narcolepsy have too little hypocretins in their brains.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9419374&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491897&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Hypocretins (what a slightly offensive term) are chemicals produced in hypothalamus (remember, we mentioned it in the first part?) which signal to the brainstem, a region which keeps us alert and awake, to.. well, keep us alert and awake. So when these hypocretin cell die off for some reason (mostly autoimmune response) it becomes hard for the affected person to stay awake for the longer period of times as nothing is signaling the brain that it should keep itself awake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now parasomnias include such things as sleep-walking, sleep terror and even sleep sex (although sometimes sleep sex is grouped in the same category as sleep-walking). 
A 2012 study revealed that 29,2% of Americans have had at least one sleepwalking episode in their lives.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://n.neurology.org/content/78/20/1583&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It typically occurs during the deep sleep of the stage 4 (the one that leaves you groggy should you wake up during it). While most occurrences are harmless, sometimes sleepwalking can really escalate (cue Kenneth Parks who sleep-drove 23 kilometres to his in-laws house and sleep-killed them and then sleep-drove himself to the police station). Studies suggest that such episodes might be due to our more “primitive” brain parts involved in emotional response (limbic system) and complex motor activity staying awake while the higher developed brain areas controlling rationality and memory remain dormant. The brain is stuck in the wake-sleep-limbo and is regulated by an archaic survival system as our normal control mechanisms are still asleep. 
&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23415568&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who murdered his in-laws during a sleepwalking episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now lastly let’s look at what happens how not getting enough sleep actually affects your brain. We all know sleep deprivation is a bitch -- you don’t feel well, you start forgetting things, you snap at people and you are just operating on an autopilot. But what exactly does it do to your brain?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Agent Cooper knows best.&lt;/p&gt;
          
          

        
      
      
    

  


&lt;p&gt;Just recently, scientists found that 24 hours of sleep deprivation can cause symptoms similar to schizophrenia: people developed strong attention and concentration deficits and were not able to filter incoming sensory information which in turn led to a sensory overload.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/27/9134.short&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They also reported an altered sense of time and smell and some people even said they had an impression that they were able to read thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago there was also a study making rounds on all social media titled something like “Brain EATS ITSELF when you don’t sleep enough!!!”. What the study actually found was that the cells responsible for cleaning out trash, destroying and digesting worn-out cells and pruning unnecessary connections between brain cells (synapses) go into overdrive in sleep-deprived mice.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/21/5263&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Astrocytes, cells which take care of redundant synapses, were active in only about 5% of cells in the brains of the well-rested mice; in the sleep deprived mice, however, this number increased to 13%. Not only that, astrocytes in sleep deprived mice began to not only carefully prune the synapses to refresh brain’s wiring, but to actually eating them in a process known as “phagocytosis” (from an Ancient Greek word meaning “to devour”). However, despite how bad it sounds (and how well the sensationalist headers like “the brain eats itself!!!” sound) the scientists said that the synapses which are getting eaten are one of the strongest, oldest and most heavily used. So in a way it is like old pieces of furniture being taken care of with a little bit of tough love. Which the researchers did not deem to be too catastrophic. Another result was a bit more worrisome. Microglia, cells which clear out old and worn-out cells (also using phagocytosis) went into overdrive after chronic sleep deprivation as well. This is not that good because microglial hyperactivation was linked to diverse neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834890/&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862638&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It has also been shown that disturbed sleep makes people more vulnerable to dementia&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5955/1005&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2670749?redirect=true&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; -- so maybe there is a link there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study has found that sleep deprivation led to a much slower reaction to outside events -- caused by the slower transmission rates between neurons.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4433&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So basically brain cells got tired too and just couldn’t transfer information in a normally fast way leading to cognitive lapses and slowed down reaction times. Instead of a post-8-hour-sleep Bugs Bunny-like race the thoughts were crawling like a turtle. 
So the moral of the story is: go to bed. No more Netflix and facebook for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.
So how much sleep do we need and how to sleep well?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have heard of the magic 8 hours of sleep. Eight hours for the most restful sleep, eight hours to align your chakras, eight hours this eight hours that. But is it actually accurate? It seems that articles challenging the 8 hour notion and offering hot new takes on the optimal sleep duration are popping up more often than I actually manage to get a full-night sleep.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/sleep-experts-close-in-on-the-optimal-nights-sleep-1405984970&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bulletproof.com/sleep-hacking-1-million-people-prove-sleeping-5-hours-is-healther-than-sleeping-8-hours/&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So what’s the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, although there is no ultimate exact-to-the-minute answer there is at least an estimate scientists seem to converge on. 
Of course, there are people, aptly called “short sleepers”, who, due to a rare genetic mutation, wake up fully rested after a very short amount of sleep (such as 4 or 5 hours) and for whom the normal rules don’t apply.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884988/&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the majority of the population is less lucky and for us ordinary people seven to eight hours seem to be a pretty good estimate. There are studies investigating the relationship between sleep and things like cardiovascular disease&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12546611&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624831/&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643470/&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, obesity&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21696306&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, depression&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566613&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and mortality rate&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20469800&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19645960&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17969458&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and showing that this relationship looks like a U-shaped curve with the above mentioned things being the lowest at 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Furthermore, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pressroom/adult-sleep-duration-consensus.pdf&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the National Sleep Foundation&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/s2352-7218%2815%2900015-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have released the sleep time duration recommendations and they both agree that it should be 7 or 8 hours (the AASM cryptically calls it “7 or more” while stating that more than 9 hours might also have adverse effects). Oversleeping does, indeed, have adverse effects: one study has found that long sleepers might be at a higher risk for dementia&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473367&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, some studies have shown that over-the-top long sleep duration (as well as too short btw!) lead to decrease in cognitive functioning&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26791423_Self-reported_sleep_duration_and_cognitive_functioning_in_a_general_population&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and impaired memory&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079936/&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and some more studies have found that inflammation levels are much higher in people sleeping more than 8 hours.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2635584/&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17322482&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this criteria it appears that the Western society is constantly toying with sleep deprivation -- some surveys estimate that 35% of the US adults and three quarters of Brits participating in the questionnaire are getting less than 7 hours of sleep.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Great-British-Bedtime-Report-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aasm.org/cdc-publishes-new-estimates-of-u-s-adult-sleep-duration/&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is pretty unfortunate since, as we remember from the previous sections, lack of sleep can take a heavy toll on your health. Moreover, it is estimated that in the US alone the sleep deprivation costs the economy billions of dollars in lost efficiency and performance.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19958/&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, it is important to plan your days the way that you get at least 7 hours of sleep most of the days -- I know, I know, it is annoying considering that an average adult in our society needs like 30 hours every day just to catch up on all the chores and workload and social life and relaxation and and and, but in the long run it is really important to not deprive our body of the precious sleep time and to make time for a full recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are probably asking: can I catch up on sleep? What if I just sleep 12 hours on the weekend: will it make my body forget the terrible all-nighters I pulled all week? Unfortunately it doesn’t work like this. One study has found that catching up on sleep on a weekend after having a sleep deprived week only decreased the subjective feelings of sleepiness and the level of inflammation.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941878&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The impaired cognitive performance (speak focus and attention) resulting from the sleep deprivation did not improve after the extensive weekend sleep session. Meaning: sleeping a lot in advance (or retroactively) won’t help your impaired concentration and attention levels; you have to sleep an adequate amount every night to keep them high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how to actually sleep better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learnt in the previous part, blue light is not a friend when it comes to falling asleep. Meaning a power-down routine including putting away your devices around an hour or two before going to bed, not using the said devices in bed in order to not associate rest with work or the overwhelming information flow (she typed on her laptop while laying in bed) or at least downloading an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://justgetflux.com&quot;&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt; which decreases the brightness of the screen before bedtime and eliminates the blue light from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method to wind down before bed includes relaxation. A mindfulness meditation (meaning no more and no less than just concentrating on your breathing, bodily experiences, your environment and noticing your thoughts instead of engaging with them) has been shown to help people with insomnia and to improve sleep quality (aside from its other 10000 health benefits).&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328970/&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2110998&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9411784&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298493&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090609072719.htm&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000578940700072X&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Something as simple as concentrating on your breath for 10 minute instead of looking at r/funny can go a long way. Your mind calms down and stops racing with the To-Do-List for tomorrow or the embarassing situations list from today. Personally I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10percenthappier.com&quot;&gt;10% Happier App (Meditation for Fidgety Sceptics)&lt;/a&gt; and I couldn’t be happier with it. They also have free meditations! (I was not paid for this ad… Unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another intuitive thing to help you sleep is to avoid caffeine before bed -- and by before bed I mean already after lunch. One study found that consuming caffeine as early as 6 hours before bedtime delays reduced total sleep time by 1 hour.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=29198&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So to make sure caffeine does not interfere with your sleeping habits it is probably a good idea to drink it at maximum 7-8 hours before bed. Another study has found that caffeine also can delay the timing of your internal clock and thus reduce your sleeping time by keeping you awake longer&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/305/305ra146&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; -- just another small reminder not to drink coffee in the second half of the day. To sum up, the sleep-friendly way to consume your daily drug would be the following: stick to the 2pm cut-off and taper caffeine as the day goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to keep it cool in the bedroom (insert an awkward sex joke here) -- it has been suggested that the optimal range for sleeping is between 18 and 21 degree Celsius (65 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepnumber.com/eng/individualNeeds/sleepTemperature.cfm&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-christopher-winter/best-temperature-for-sleep_b_3705049.html&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/cant-sleep-adjust-the-temperature&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some hours before falling asleep our body temperature starts to fall -- and the mild drop in the room temperature helps induce sleep. One study has found that just a 0.4C increase in skin temperature (which allows the body to release more heat) led to sounder sleep and fewer wake-ups.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, some studies show that disturbed thermoregulation (and thus a too high body temperature during the night) is associated with some forms of insomnia.&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18603220?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have a good idea of how to make the most of your sleep, what are the adverse effects of thinking 3 hours of sleep after an all-nighter are enough and also that some guy killed people during a sleep-walking episode. Good night and stay tuned for a neuroscience news block coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

As we grow older or have a brain injury or a stroke or develop a neurodegenerative disease, we forget much more often. Is there a technological intervention that can help us remember?

In NoStim lists, stimulation was not delivered on analogous trials, and the comparison between those two conditions comprised the main contrast shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VnrQIwHaPAQ/WsAcrT63YrI/AAAAAAAAMf4/j3jM_gJemFsFNYzVQyS59BdDSx-bdK4JACLcBGAs/s1600/Stim_NoStim%2Bodds%2Bratio.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;440&quot; data-original-width=&quot;305&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VnrQIwHaPAQ/WsAcrT63YrI/AAAAAAAAMf4/j3jM_gJemFsFNYzVQyS59BdDSx-bdK4JACLcBGAs/s320/Stim_NoStim%2Bodds%2Bratio.png&quot; width=&quot;221&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3a (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02753-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ezzyat et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; Stimulation delivered to lateral temporal cortex targets increased the probability of recall compared to matched unstimulated words in the same subject (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and stimulation delivered to Non-lateral temporal targets in an independent group (P &amp;lt; 0.01). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors found that that lateral temporal cortex stimulation increased the relative probability of item recall by 15% (using a log-binomial model to estimate the relative change in recall probability). {But if you want to see all of the data, peruse the &lt;b&gt;Appendix&lt;/b&gt; below. Overall recall isn't that great...}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lateral temporal cortex (n=18) meant &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_temporal_gyrus&quot; title=&quot;Middle temporal gyrus&quot;&gt;MTG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_temporal_gyrus&quot; title=&quot;Superior temporal gyrus&quot;&gt;STG&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_temporal_gyrus&quot; title=&quot;Inferior temporal gyrus&quot;&gt;IFG&lt;/a&gt; (mostly on the left). Non-lateral temporal cortex (n=11) meant elsewhere (see &lt;b&gt;Appendix&lt;/b&gt; below). The improvements were greatest with stimulation in the middle portion of the left middle temporal gyrus. There are many reason for poor encoding, and one could be that subjects  were not paying enough attention. The authors didn't have the electrode  coverage to test that explicitly. This leads me to believe that electrical stimulation was enhancing the semantic encoding of the words. The MTG is thought to be critical for semantic representations and language comprehension in general (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3039157/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turken &amp;amp; Dronkers, 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, my interpretation of the results is that stimulation may have  boosted semantic encoding of the words, given the nature of the stimuli  (words, obviously), the left lateralization with a focus in MTG, and the lack of an  encoding task. The verbal memory literature clearly demonstrates that when  subjects have a deep semantic encoding task (e.g., living/non-living decision),  compared to shallow orthographic (are there letters that extend above/below?) or  phonological tasks, recall and recognition are improved. Which led me to ask some questions, and one of the authors kindly replied (Dan Rizzuto, personal communication). &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you ever have conditions that contrasted different encoding tasks? Here I meant to ask about semantic vs orthographic encoding (because the instructions were always to “remember the words” with no specific encoding task).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We studied three verbal learning tasks (uncategorized free recall, categorized free recall, paired associates learning) and one spatial navigation task during the DARPA RAM project. We were able to successfully decode recalled / non-recalled words using the same classifier across the three different verbal memory tasks, but we never got sufficient paired associates data to determine whether we could reliably increase memory performance on this task.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Did you ever test nonverbal stimuli (not nameable pictures, which have a verbal code), but visual-spatial stimuli? Here I was trying to assess the lexical-semantic nature of the effect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;With regard to the spatial navigation task, we did observe a few individual patients with LTC stimulation-related enhancement, but we haven't yet replicated the effect across the population.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this method may have therapeutic implications in the future, at present it is too impractical, and the gains were quite small. Nonetheless, it is an accomplished piece of work to demonstrate closed-loop memory enhancement in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since that time, however, the UCLA group has reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/29515&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theta-burst microstimulation&lt;/a&gt; of....     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;....the right entorhinal area during learning significantly improved subsequent memory specificity for novel portraits; participants were able both to recognize previously-viewed photos and reject similar lures. These results suggest that microstimulation with physiologic level currents—a radical departure from commonly used deep brain stimulation protocols—is sufficient to modulate human behavior and provides an avenue for refined interrogation of the circuits involved in human memory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, I was running between two sessions and missed that particular talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This level of prediction is more like a proof of concept and would not be clinically acceptable at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thanks also to Youssef Ezzyat and Cory Inman, whom I met at the symposium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ezzyat Y, Wanda PA, Levy DF, Kadel A, Aka A, Pedisich I, Sperling MR, Sharan AD, Lega BC, Burks A, Gross RE, Inman CS, Jobst BC, Gorenstein MA, Davis KA, Worrell GA, Kucewicz MT, Stein JM, Gorniak R, Das SR, Rizzuto DS, Kahana MJ.

Alongside industry leaders like Microsoft, Coupa, IBM, and KPMG, Science Exchange is on the shortlist for two awards: Best New Procurement Consultancy Project, with pharmaceutical client GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Health, and Best Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Specialist Provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange was recognized for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/enterprise&quot;&gt;P2P platform&lt;/a&gt;, which empowered procurement teams and increased R&amp;amp;D operational efficiency at GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health (GSK-CH) and another major global pharmaceutical client with rapid access to innovation through outsourced R&amp;amp;D.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“We are honored to be recognized once again by Procurement Leaders for the work we are doing with our clients to help accelerate breakthrough discoveries,” said Dr. Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder of Science Exchange. “Outsourcing with scientific service providers is crucial for increasing R&amp;amp;D efficiency, but finding and qualifying providers can be a time-consuming process. Our platform accelerates scientific breakthroughs by  connecting researchers to thousands of scientific services from a network of thoroughly vetted providers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The winners of the awards will be announced on May 17, 2018 at the World Procurement Awards Ceremony in London, England. To find out more and see a list of all the finalists, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;visit the website at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldprocurementawards.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;www.worldprocurementawards.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best New Procurement Consultancy Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the category Best New Procurement Consultancy Project, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health (GSK-CH) implemented Science Exchange to increase the productivity of their R&amp;amp;D operations. Through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/enterprise&quot;&gt;Science Exchange platform&lt;/a&gt;, GSK-CH researchers gained instant access to the 2,500+ outsourced service providers on the Science Exchange network, including niche and innovative technologies. Science Exchange was able to broaden the GSK-CH R&amp;amp;D organization’s geographical reach, capitalize on local demand, help spur innovation, and advance their timelines to bring products to market faster. Some of the results included an 11% increase in GSK-CH’s access to innovative providers (YTD) and 44 new niche providers selected by GSK-CH during scouting efforts this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best P2P Specialist Provider&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the category Best P2P Specialist Provider, a leading global pharmaceutical company explored the potential to increase their R&amp;amp;D productivity by using the Science Exchange technology platform to improve its outsourcing processes. Instead of spending hours a day exploring service providers, the scientists logged into Science Exchange and quickly reviewed service provider satisfaction ratings, secured competitive quotes, and selected a supplier to meet their research needs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After one year of using Science Exchange, this global pharmaceutical company’s preclinical services group reported that scientists saved 1,300 hours, the legal and procurement teams saved 2,730 hours, and the combined time-savings translated to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost savings.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;About World Procurement Awards &lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The World Procurement Awards, in association with SAP Ariba, are the most celebrated and sought-after awards in procurement, representing the best projects, people and organizations across the world. They reward the collective efforts of individuals and teams and are an affirmation of the hard work, innovation and dedication of those at the forefront of this dynamic global profession.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This year saw a record number of entries from some of the most influential companies across 36 countries for the 12th annual awards. The judges were impressed with the sheer quality of this year’s submissions, commenting that the bar had once again been raised, with innovation at the heart of each project as teams across the globe work hard to position themselves as valuable business partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Many journals are adopting a recently developed mechanism for correcting the scientific record known as “retract and replace” — usually employed when the original paper has been affected by honest errors. But if an article is retracted and replaced, can readers always tell? To find out, Ana Marušić at the University of Split School of … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/29/a-new-publishing-approach-retract-and-replace-is-having-growing-pains/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;A new publishing approach — retract and replace — is having growing pains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: The Psychology of Fighting, Digested: 9 Fascinating Findings Involving Boxing and Other Combat Sports</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/29/the-psychology-of-fighting-digested-9-fascinating-findings-involving-boxing-and-other-combat-sports/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the world heavyweight boxing championship reunification fight on March 31, 2018, featuring Great Britain’s Anthony Joshua versus Joseph Parker from New Zealand – the first time that two undefeated heavyweight world champions competed in the UK – we trawled the psychology literature looking for intriguing findings involving boxers and other sporting fighters. From the curse of the pre-match smile, to the cognitive biases that sway your choice of greatest ever boxer, here’s the psychology of fighting, digested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33609&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can judge a lot from a fighter’s face&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Joshua and Parker stood face to face for the customary stare down earlier this week, there were no smiles to be seen. Perhaps the fighters heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/11/smiling-fighters-are-more-likely-to-lose/&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; we covered five years ago involving competitors from the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which showed that those who smiled more intensely at the pre-match face-off were more likely to lose that upcoming fight. The researchers’ theory is that smiles are an involuntary signal of submission and lack of aggression, just as teeth baring is in the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another line of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/06/20/a-mans-fighting-ability-is-written-in-his-face/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, also involving UFC fighters, found that those with faces that are wide relative to their length are more formidable fighters. The same paper showed how we pick up on this cue instinctively, judging fighters with wider faces as more deadly. One theory is that face-width is correlated with testosterone levels – men with higher basal testosterone have wider faces, as well as greater strength and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/26/6/1470/204957&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that people could predict, at better than chance levels, the winners of mixed martial arts fights purely from looking at the faces of any two competitors. The participants seemed to be picking up on facial cues linked to masculinity, strength and aggressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A beard doesn’t offer any protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this week’s pre-match press conference Joshua Parker appeared clean-shaven, having previously sported a fulsome beard. Given the research on the facial cues linked with fighting success, boxers could be forgiven for wanting to wear a thick beard as a way to appear more intimidating and masculine. But if they are hoping it might also offer some protection, they are mistaken, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(17)30266-0/abstract&quot;&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; of 395 UFC fighters that found those with beards were just as vulnerable to being knocked out, and were no more likely to win. “We suggest that beards represent dishonest signals of formidability,” the researchers concluded. However, Parker may wish to take note of another finding from the study – fighters with a longer reach were more likely to win (Joshua has a longer reach than Parker by 10cm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-match mind games are an important part of the sport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the media build up to the Joshua–Parker fight, Parker’s camp released a video featuring all the times that Joshua has previously been “dropped” – a clear attempt to get under his skin. These kind of mind games are an important part of the contest, of which Mohammed Ali was arguably the master.  Despite their importance, these games have been little studied by psychologists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/9342/1/Wilson_Rushton_and_Kenny_Greenough%20-%20journal%20article.pdf&quot;&gt;A recent interview-based study&lt;/a&gt; of four elite male amateur boxers from Manchester is a rare exception. The boxers described their mind game tactics during the pre-match weigh-in (including exuding confidence by tensing their muscles, and flashing a smile at their opponent – perhaps a mistake, see above); at the warm up immediately prior to a fight (e.g. switching stances deliberately to confuse their opponent); and during the ring entrance (e.g. making prolonged eye contact, and wearing a robe with badges implying prior success).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of “making the weight” has costs and benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In boxing and other combat sports that have weight divisions, competitors often go to extreme lengths to lose weight prior to a pre-match weigh-in, and then they rehydrate and refuel in the short time they have left before the fight. This is not such an issue for Joshua and Parker because as super heavy-weights, they do not need to make a particular weight limit for the fight. However research suggests that the practice of drastically cutting weight prior to weigh-ins may be harmful to fighters in many ways – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/6/390&quot;&gt;a recent study of amateur boxers&lt;/a&gt; found that it led to “higher scores on anger, fatigue, and tension with reduced vigour” and that the boxers performed worse on a circuit training task after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more surprising is how cutting weight seems to also have a positive psychological component. Elite Swedish competitors in wrestling, judo and taekwondo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.natajournals.org/doi/full/10.4085/1062-6050-48.1.04&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how making the weight led them to feel more like “real athletes”. Others told how it signals power and control and gave them a mental advantage: “You feel a bit like that Rocky Balboa character, in the scene when he is running up those stairs. You know, the preparations, because you have to give yourself a decent chance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southpaws have an advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-handers have an advantage in many sports because of the simple fact that they are used to competing against right-handers, whereas right-handers are far less accustomed to competing against left-handers. This left-hand advantage applies in boxing where left-handed fighters are called southpaws (right-handers may also switch to a southpaw stance, leading with their right hand). For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1357650X.2014.961471?scroll=top&amp;amp;needAccess=true&quot;&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 2,500 professional boxers’ records from 1924 to 2012 found that southpaws had a better win-lose ratio, on average. A much smaller &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/43/2/142&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving semi-professional Turkish boxers came to the same conclusion. Indeed, one explanation for the persistence of left-handedness at a similar rate through human history is the so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9025310&quot;&gt;fighting hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;“, which is that idea that being left-handed confers a fighting advantage. Joshua and Parker are both orthodox right-handed fighters so they need not concern themselves too much with this research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boxing and martial arts train your brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blows to the head are profoundly harmful to the human brain – make no mistake. There is a wealth of research on the neurological toll of being a boxer, including at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060915204035.htm?utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ScienceDaily_TMD_1&amp;amp;utm_source=TMD&quot;&gt;amateur level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the head-impacts in combat sport cause neurological harm, conversely the training of reflexes and reactions that are an integral part of boxing and related sports have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452216306960#b0060&quot;&gt;a recent brain-wave study&lt;/a&gt; of boxers and fencers responding to go and stop commands found that both groups showed enhanced preparatory brain activity and faster response times than controls (fencers showed the greater advantage because their responses were faster &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more accurate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-014-0719-y&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; compared the ability of young and old martial artists and controls to detect dots in their visual periphery as fast as possible: the participants who practised judo or karate were faster, and older participants who practised a martial art competitively when they were young showed less age-related slowing in their reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which combat sport is associated with the greatest cognitive enhancement? There’s an argument that Kung Fu is king, at least based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier_Sanchez-Lopez2/publication/276493620_Differences_between_Judo_Taekwondo_and_Kung-fu_Athletes_in_Sustained_Attention_and_Impulse_Control/links/567a6cb608ae40c0e27f4cbe.pdf&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; of sustained attention and impulse control among Judo, Taekwondo and Kung-fu athletes. The last group showed “better inhibition ability (indicated by fewer commission errors) and less response time variability and performance decrement” than the others. The researchers attributed this to “the greater dedication demanded by kung-fu training as well as the martial art’s promotion of discipline, self-control and meditation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martial arts reduce aggression and aid emotional intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of boxing and martial arts often argue that, while the sports undeniably involve aggression, they also teach self-control and restraint, thereby encouraging better behaviour outside of the ring or dojo. This seems to be backed up by research, at least among children and teenagers. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/07/the-art-of-not-fighting-martial-arts-reduce-child-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 12 prior studies found that participating in martial arts reduced child and teen aggression, including lowering their physical aggression, verbal and physical bullying, theft and vandalism. One recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.904.9148&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; even suggested that boxing can boost “emotional intelligence”. Comparing boxers, judokas and controls, the researchers found that both combat groups scored higher on appraising others’ emotions, while the boxers scored highest on using and controlling their emotions, and they scored lowest on trait neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sparring is very different from the real thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that one secret to becoming a sporting champion is learning to perform under pressure with the same freedom and composure as you do when training. Key to developing this ability, though, is making sure that training is as realistic as possible, which is arguably a greater challenge in boxing and  martial arts than in non-combat sports. This dilemma was highlighted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00025/full&quot;&gt;an impressive recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that took fighting and psychological metrics during taekwondo sparring and compared them with same metrics during a competitive fight. There were many significant differences, both in terms of performance (for instance, when sparring, the fighters were less attacking and kept a greater distance) and psychologically (for example, the fighters were less anxious and felt less mentally challenged during sparring). “This study showed that fighting in training does not adequately simulate the affective and cognitive demands of fighting in competition,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The psychology behind who you think is the greatest ever boxer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the sport, if you play the game of “Who was the greatest?” your judgment will probably be swayed by the “availability heuristic” (we judge as more important those examples that we can bring more easily to mind) and the “reminiscence bump” (we find it easier to recall memories from our teens and early twenties). So if you are in your youth today, it is quite likely, in years to come, that you will tell your children that Anthony Joshua was the greatest ever boxer, though this may of course depend on the outcome of Saturday’s match, and whether he can also defeat Deontay Wilder, if that fight ever happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/09/what-your-choice-of-best-ever-footballer-says-about-human-memory/&quot;&gt;the reminiscence bump effect&lt;/a&gt; in an online survey of people’s beliefs about the “greatest ever footballer” – participants overwhelming tended to name players whose career mid-point coincided with participants’ teens and early twenties (for instance, Johan Cruijff was most often selected by participants who were aged 9 to 18 when he was at his career midpoint; Pelé was most often selected by participants who were aged between 12 and 21 years when he was mid-career).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar phenomenon was observed for judgments about &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1998.87.3f.1310&quot;&gt;the “greatest boxers of all time”&lt;/a&gt; by noted boxing historians for &lt;em&gt;Ring&lt;/em&gt; magazine in 1998. In compiling their top 20, the judges, all of whom were born after 1939, showed a clear bias against fighters from the pre-1939 era. Writing in the journal &lt;em&gt;Perceptual and Motor Skills&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers said their analysis “does not support the magazine’s contention that ‘history has been served’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck on Saturday, AJ.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Draft of chapter 6, Spike initiation with an initial segment</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/draft-of-chapter-6-spike-initiation-with-an-initial-segment/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have just uploaded an incomplete draft of chapter 6, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theory-of-action-potentials-chapter-6.pdf&quot;&gt;Spike initiation with an initial segment&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. This chapter deals with how spikes are initiated in most vertebrate neurons (and also some invertebrate neurons), where there is a hotspot of excitability close to a large soma. This situation has a number of interesting implications which make spike initiation quite different from the situation investigated by Hodgkin and Huxley, that of stimulating the middle of an axon. Most of the chapter describes the theory that I have developed to analyze this situation, called &quot;resistive coupling theory&quot; because the axonal hotspot is resistively coupled to the soma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter is currently unfinished, because a few points require a little more research, which we have not finished. The presentation is also a bit more technical than I would like, so this is really a draft. I wanted nonetheless to release it now, as I have not uploaded a chapter for a while and it could be some time before the chapter is finished.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blonde women are arguably the most sexually objectified and stereotyped women, but could this equate to more #metoo scenarios for blondes? Women often report experiencing increased attention and harassment from strangers as a given when going blonde. With an increased level of sexual attention and harassment, do women with blonde hair (from the bottle or not) have a greater risk of sexual assault than brunettes?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My First Day as a First-Time Blonde…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was a brunette. Using the magical powers of bleach I am now a first-time “blonde” (#silverhairtrend). It’s only hair…right? I immediately learned my error the moment I exited the hairdressers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets feel different: there is definitely more regular catcalling, definitely more leering, I’m definitely approached more, and the creep/stalker factor definitely went up a very hefty notch. I mean, being a woman (#metoo), unwanted sexual attention is certainly not unusual, but at this frequency (#nonstop) and extra level of invasiveness…really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea that blonde women have it this bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Is it just me? Or do all blondes get harassed more on the street…and beyond? Should I be brushing up on my Krav Maga? Is it time to invest in my first pepper spray? If in doubt, research!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Research Says…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Question 1: Are Blondes Stereotyped as Sex Objects? &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources say YES!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no statistics released regarding hair color and rates of harassment or sexual assault. One thing research has made clear is that blonde women are more &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/11/the-dangers-of-american-sexual-prudishness/&quot;&gt;sexually objectified&lt;/a&gt; than brunettes, i.e., reduced to a sexual object, rather than being seen as a full person. Similarly, research strongly demonstrates that the greater the sexual objectification the less deserving of respect a woman is considered to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, women that are more sexually objectified are considered less human and are more likely to be processed by the male brain like a toaster or a sheep than a human! (The reverse relationship hasn’t been found in women’s brains, the tendency demonstrated thus far is to process sexually objectified men as human beings, not objects or animals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As reported in both qualitative research and popular media, women who have been on both sides of the peroxide bottle before commonly report more encounters with strangers where they feel to be treated more like an object, are presumed to be dumber, receive less respect, are taken less seriously, and receive aggression more readily than when they are brunettes. You can feel it, it’s palpable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired of being a sexual object in the workplace, accomplished CEO Eileen Carey says that she made the decision to dye her blonde hair darker to fend off unwanted sexual attention, to be taken more seriously, allowing her to be perceived as the strong &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/03/06/why-some-human-brains-become-leaders-while-others-followers/&quot;&gt;business leader&lt;/a&gt; that she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is not alone. This ‘going brunette to escape the blonde stereotype’ trend is echoed in a qualitative study of the challenges facing female undergraduate engineering students. One student refused to return to blonde hair from fear of negative treatment from her male peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go back to being a blonde because I feel like I’m getting enough grief as it is as a woman. I feel like honestly, a woman with blonde hair, they just take you like a stereotypical Barbie. I feel like the brunette gives me a little more power. They [male peers] seem to take me more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Question 2: Are Blondes harassed more by strangers? &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial sources say YES!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empirical research exists on what makes blondes more attractive. For example, one study has shown that men (on average) judge women with blonde hair to be ‘significantly’ younger- and healthier-looking. Findings from other studies include blonde women being perceived as more popular and less intelligent (especially platinum blondes) than brunettes (i.e., the dumb blonde stereotype). But research asking if or why blonde women are sexually harassed, abused, or assaulted more is nearly nonexistent. At least for peer-reviewed research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although certainly not highly controlled experiments, some modern-day superwomen have come to science’s rescue with their own blonde Vs brunette experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such woman is Devin Lytle, a lifetime-long brunette, she dyed her hair platinum blonde to conduct her own set of social experiments. As generally echoed in more hardcore science, she was seen as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/04/the-laws-of-attraction-a-neurology-and-psychology-expert-explains/&quot;&gt;more attractive&lt;/a&gt;, got more tinder swipes, and was viewed as sweeter and less uptight than her native brunette alter ego. Importantly, this seemed to come hand in hand with getting more catcalls on the street (three as a blonde and zero as a brunette, despite wearing the exact same outfit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayley Quinn, another natural brunette, did three social experiments using a blonde wig (a chivalry test, a tinder test, and a street attractiveness test). She couldn’t even get started with street experiments without being approached as a blonde. Although there was no “catcalling experiment” per se, her personal experience was that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love being a brunette, it’s easier and nicer. But if you want to go blonde we can definitely say that blondes might not have more fun, but they definitely get noticed more, definitely get approached more, and definitely get judged more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Some very early research from the 1980s supports our DIY scientists, concluding that objectified women—and by extension, blondes in particular—are subject to more sexual harassment, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual attention in public spaces by strangers. Today, in research settings, the tendency towards female harassment has been shown to intensify simply by showing men videos that objectify women—which is not rare for blondes in popular media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Question 3: Does the objectification and dehumanization of blondes increase risk of sexual assault? &lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does for objectified women generally, why not blondes!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although context is always king, it’s safe to say that the blonde woman stereotype is THE most sexually objectifying and therefore most &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/12/28/mind-games-sciences-attempts-at-thought-control/&quot;&gt;dehumanizing&lt;/a&gt; of all the hair color stereotypes. But is this dehumanization a prelude to violence and increased risk of sexual assault?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research undoubtedly shows that dehumanization as a consequence of sexual objectification has dire consequences. This is pretty evident in research on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/05/01/societal-assumptions-on-abuse-and-the-victims-perspective/&quot;&gt;rape perceptions&lt;/a&gt;, where sexual objectification increases victim blaming and diminishes rapist blame in cases of stranger rape. Just like a torturous death of an animal can be seen as less torturous if the animal is considered to be for food, the sexual assault of a woman is seen as less of an assault if the woman is considered to be for sex—like blondes—making them more vulnerable to violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research holds that men with hostile or aggressive views toward women are more likely to objectify. In reverse, if a man tends to view women more like animals or objects they are more likely to be sexually aggressive towards women. The latest study showed that sexual objectification increases &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/20/the-role-of-serotonin-and-glutamine-in-aggression/&quot;&gt;physical aggression&lt;/a&gt; toward women without provocation (i.e., even if there is no negative behaviour that could provoke aggression, if you’re seen as a sex object, aggression towards you is generally higher). It doesn’t look good for blondes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although currently there is no direct research exploring causal relationships between women’s hair color, associated stereotypes, and rates of harassment or assault, connecting the dots between the early evidence makes it clear we would be “very blonde” not to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I say…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I LOVE my new hair, I do look younger and more healthy—when you are dealing with health problems this is priceless! Although I am understandably annoyed by this extra unwanted attention, perhaps naively, having always consider myself a tough woman that has fought off men, saving both myself and others from assault, I am not (and refuse to be) more scared because of my change in hair color. Naive or not, I cannot help but worry for women who may not have the devictimizing confidence I carry like a weapon or that fear they can’t defend themselves. Women having to dye their hair darker to feel safer around strangers is not ok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly didn’t expect that going blonde would instil a strong desire to break a potentially dangerous stereotype. Although the interplay between the media misrepresentation of blondes and evolutionary engrained perceptions of fertility and youth likely drive the painting of all blonde haired women with the same sexually objectifying and dehumanizing dye brush, we as women still have the means to take some of that power back. And I plan to do just that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does power posing –  such as standing with your hands on your hips and your feet spaced well apart – really help to improve your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; – according to Amy Cuddy, one of the pioneers of the idea, at Harvard University (famous for her massively popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; on the subject and her best-selling book &lt;i&gt;Presence&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; – according to a critical analysis by Joseph Simmons and Uri Simonsohn at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2791272&quot;&gt;published in Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. The pair’s statistical analysis of 33 previous studies of potential posture effects led them to a damning conclusion: “the existing evidence is too weak to… advocate for people to engage in power posing to better their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now Cuddy, and colleagues, are back, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/CzbNAn7Ch6ZZirK9yMGH/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; also published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;. While Cuddy appears to be softening her claims about what power-posing can achieve, she and her colleagues argue that their new analysis shows that there is strong evidence that posture affects emotions in particular, and that power-posing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; likely to have a meaningful impact on people, and should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33561&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new paper involves the same type of statistical analysis (called a p-curve analysis) adopted by Simmons and Simonsohn, which uses the distribution of “p values” to estimate the likelihood of falsely positive results in a given set of studies. But whereas Simmons and Simonsohn used this technique to analyse 33 published studies that Cuddy and others had highlighted in a 2015 paper, the new analysis was performed on every single peer-reviewed study in the field that Cuddy and her colleagues could find. This literature search added 21 studies to the total. In the new analysis, the researchers also looked specifically at potential effects of posture on feelings of power, which Simmons and Simonsohn did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis provides clear evidence, Cuddy’s team argue, that people who adopt open, expansive, “power” poses do &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; more powerful. And “feeling powerful is an intrinsically consequential, theoretically important, fundamental outcome,” they write. “We believe that even transient feelings of power can have long-lasting consequences for people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say their new work also provides “very strong” evidence that expansive vs. contractive (such as self-hugging) postures have other emotion-related effects, including affecting participants’ recall of positive vs. negative memories, their self-evaluations, their specific emotional state, and their ability to recover from a negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about impacts of power posing on actual behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims that power posing can change the way people behave – affecting their willingness to take risks or how they perform in a job interview, for example – are not supported by the new analysis, nor for that matter were they supported by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2017.1342447&quot;&gt;recent series of papers&lt;/a&gt; that failed to replicate previous work that had found power posing alters behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cuddy and her colleagues argue that “there is a need for experimental tests of incremental or longitudinal effects of adopting expansive postures over time on various outcomes,” adding that “Right now, we are not aware of any such research”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas about what power-posing can, and can’t, do are clearly being refined. And will no doubt continue to be refined, as more studies are published – something that this new work perhaps makes more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their 2017 paper, Simmons and Simonsohn questioned the justification for spending “valuable resources” on research into power posing. In the conclusion to the new paper, Cuddy and her co-authors write: “Our findings…should encourage researchers who are investigating this area to continue to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>A few months ago, Dirk Werling discovered he had made a horrible mistake: He had inadvertently plagiarized in his recent review. On January 20, Werling said he came across a 2016 paper while working on a grant and realized he had published some of the text in his 2018 review in Research in Veterinary Science. … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/27/absolutely-mortified-after-unintentionally-plagiarizing-author-offers-to-step-down-from-new-post/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;“Absolutely mortified” after unintentionally plagiarizing, author offers to step down from new post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Display without Delay: Search, Browse &amp; Cite PLOS Articles with Quick Abstracts from Google Scholar</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/yTxhsxkvH-M/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/03/quick-abstracts_3-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Working off your mobile device? No problem. We just made it easier to use your phone to find and scan PLOS articles.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re someone who’s out in the field more than in the lab, you may have been challenged finding research on the fly. That’s now in the past. To expedite discovery and access to PLOS research articles, we’ve worked with Google Scholar to include PLOS abstracts in their new Quick Abstracts feature. Researchers around the world can now view complete abstracts and explore citations quickly and efficiently from any mobile device. For scientists, educators, policy makers and journalists, this means more efficient and timely access to the academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.googleblog.com/2018/03/quickly-flip-through-papers-on-your.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Abstracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allows researchers to tap on any search result to browse the full abstract text of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/publications&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; directly on their cell phone, then either return to the search results or swipe right and left to read additional abstracts. From a link at the bottom of the abstract text, readers are taken directly to the complete article. Quick Abstracts even serves up preprint abstracts from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, further extending discoverability of work by authors who opt to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post their preprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at time of submission to PLOS journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Abstracts includes all the expected features of Google Scholar, including saving to “My Library” through the star button, and display of citing and related articles. Additionally, an entire discovery network is available through use of search strings on the Google Scholar homepage. For example, entering “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;q=site%3Ajournals.plos.org&amp;amp;btnG=&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;site:journals.plos.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” in the search bar retrieves abstracts of the entire database of PLOS research articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation for All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research, discovery and knowledge on the go shouldn’t be restricted to technology-driven economies. While the majority of cell phone users in the United States and Europe benefit from 3G, and even 4G, technologies and fast data delivery speeds on their mobile devices, this is not the case &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensignal.com/reports/2016/08/global-state-of-the-mobile-network&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Quick Abstracts integrates mobile network optimization that enables abstract display without delay, especially important for communities in the global south browsing and reading journals such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and related research in additional PLOS journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open. Fast. Global.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of Quick Abstracts is a logical extension of our ongoing relationship with Google Scholar—one based on making research more open and available throughout the global scholarly research community. Our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CC BY licensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/open-access&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Access ethos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and mobile-ready delivery of journal content enables innovators like Google Scholar to bring their latest technologies to PLOS, for the benefit of our authors and the wider scientific community. Like our partnership with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;laboratory methods citations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and collaboration with bioRxiv for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprints with our journal submissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, this is just one more example of how we’re working with external collaborators to transform research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;No more waiting to get back to your desk, lab or laptop to explore a potential new project, prepare for journal club or add to your reference list—head to scholar.google.com from your cell phone for abstract display without delay.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With suicide among &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36378573&quot;&gt;university students on the increase in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an urgent need to find better ways to support those students who are experiencing distress. Many campuses have provisions in place, such as student counselling services, but students often prefer to turn to their peers in times of need. This raises the possibility that students themselves are best placed to sound the alarm if and when one of their friends is going through a crisis. A new study from the US – where there are similar concerns about student mental health issues – has investigated how well college roommates are able to recognise each other’s levels of emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217754192&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlight the challenge of requiring students to look out for each other – generally, students who shared a room underestimated each other’s distress levels. And while students who were identified by their roommates as being very distressed were indeed more likely to actually be very distressed, many of them were not, which demonstrates the problem of false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33554&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qi Xu and Patrick Shrout at New York University recruited 187 same-sex pairs of students who shared a room together at college and had done so for at least five months (85 per cent of the pairs were female and just over half were White). In February and then again in April, the students rated how much over the previous six weeks they had experienced various emotions indicative of distress, such as hopelessness, and how much they thought their roommate had experienced the same emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the students underestimated each other’s distress. Gender and relationship closeness between roommates made no difference. The students were swayed to an extent by their own distress levels, such that they had a bias to see their roommate as less distressed than they were themselves (this is consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/24/other-people-may-experience-more-misery-than-you-realise/&quot;&gt;prior research&lt;/a&gt; that’s found we generally tend to assume other people are happier than they are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of the size of the students’ mis-measure of each other’s distress, on average for each unit increase in self-reported distress reported by one roommate, their room buddy tended to estimate that their distress had only increased by 0.26 units (and that’s even after accounting for the bias caused by any changes in the estimating student’s own distress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the ability of students to spot specifically if their roommate had been experiencing a significant level of distress? The researchers estimated that nearly 20 per cent of their sample had a score indicative of moderate or severe distress. If a participant thought their roommate was significantly distressed then that student’s risk of actually being so was double the average rate (that is, around 40 per cent of students rated as significantly distressed by their roommate actually were significantly distressed based on their self-ratings). The problem is, this still means that the majority – 60 per cent – of students rated as significantly distressed by a roommate were not actually very distressed. In other words, if college authorities followed up every time that a student reported their roommate to be significantly distressed, there would be a lot of false alarms, meaning wasted resources, at least some awkwardness, perhaps even resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu and Shrout said their results “underscore the need to consider peer reports as a screening tool rather than a precise source of information”. They added that “more universal training on how to identify and respond to the distress of peers might have the benefit of encouraging conversations among roommates about what actions each might take if he or she noticed another experiencing extreme distress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217754192&quot;&gt;Accuracy and Bias in Perception of Distress Level and Distress Change Among Same-Sex College Student Roommate Dyads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Toxicology-Research-Laboratory-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2017 was an exciting year for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We continued to publish some of the most exciting research related to a range of pharmacological and toxicological topics. Throughout the year we published articles on models predicting drug-drug interactions, potential drugs to suppress tumor growth and toxins which adversely impact physiological functioning.  Below are three articles from 2017 that we believe deserve extra attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational modeling can predict adverse drug reactions induced by drug interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications can cause several adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, when more than one medication is taken at a time ADRs can increase due to drug-drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than 800 drugs on the market, and it is incredibly difficult to track whether there are drug-drug interaction ADRs for specific drug combinations since they either do not exist, have not been reported, or the drug combination has not been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 800 drugs on the market, and it is incredibly difficult to track whether there are drug-drug interaction ADRs for specific drug combinations since they either do not exist, have not been reported, or the drug combination has not been taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these challenges, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0153-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Liu et al. used computational modeling to determine the number and severity of drug-drug interaction ADRs without having to track human patients. For this computational model, the authors utilized the STITCH database, which tracks drug-protein interaction profiles, and TWOSIDES, which tracks ADRs caused by synergistic drug-drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of these databases allowed for the identification of what types of drugs had high and low rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs. Drug classes such as cardiovascular drugs and musculoskeletal drugs were associated with the highest numbers of drug-drug interaction ADRs while antineoplastics (anti-tumor drugs) and immunomodulators were associated with the lowest rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modeling process also allowed for the calculation of the rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs between two classes of drugs. For example, combining antifungals and proton-pump inhibitors can result in high rates of ADRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the modeling predicted the rate of ADRs when combining a drug of one class with drugs of another class.  For example, the anti-infectious agent, norfloxacin, had a low adverse drug-drug interaction score when taken with anti-convulsants while a different anti-infectious agent, Nafcillin, had a high adverse drug-drug interaction score when taken with an anti-convulsant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the myriad of drugs on the market, this study provides important information for the safety and efficacy of drug prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure to the antimicrobial, triclosan, can decrease the resilience of the mouse gut microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10065&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Triclosan products&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10065&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Triclosan-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Substances containing triclosan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;flickr.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synergistic relationship between microbiota and an animal is critical for the animal’s health with alterations in the gut potentially leading to health issues. The microbiota can change in response to factors including diet, pesticides and metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triclosan is an antimicrobial that is extensively used in medical and household products such as soaps, cleaning products, and even toothpastes. Worryingly, growing evidence is showing that triclosan may have a negative impact on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0150-9&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology &lt;/em&gt;tested whether triclosan does disrupt the gut microbiome, mice were exposed to water with triclosan or plain water to act as a control. Researchers performed 16s rRNA sequencing to identify the type and number of gut bacteria species during 13 weeks of triclosan exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16S rRNA refers to a specific part of bacteria ribosomal RNA that allows for bacterial species identification. The researchers found that triclosan had a significant impact on both the composition and function of the gut microbiome in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance was the increase in certain bacterial genes which indicated that chronic triclosan exposure was leading to antibacterial resistance. While certain antibacterial resistant genes increased, other gut bacteria decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combined change in gut bacteria can have detrimental effects for two reasons. First, an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria can result in a decrease in antibiotic efficacy.  Second, a variety of gut bacterial species is important because greater species richness can attenuate any disruptions to the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study therefore demonstrates that triclosan can have potential detrimental effects on gut microbiota and repercussions on an animal’s health. More research needs to be done to determine if and what kind of health effects occur as well as whether these findings can be extrapolated to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methylxanthines alter the structure and function of the cardiac system in zebrafish embryos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylxanthines are one of the most commonly ingested substances in the world. They are found in regularly consumed beverages, such as coffee, and are also used medicinally to treat ailments such as asthma, peripheral vascular disease, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that a single early exposure of methylxanthines can have toxic effects on body morphology, cardiovascular structures, and cardiovascular functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that methylxanthines can be toxic and that this toxicity can start as early as gestation.  The authors of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0179-9&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; examined the potential toxic effects on the developing cardiovascular system by using zebrafish, which show a surprisingly similar response to cardiotoxins as mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the cardiotoxic effects of methylxanthines, four different doses of eight different methylxanthines were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;injected into recently fertilized zebrafish eggs, and the effects of methylxanthines on embryo morphology and cardiovascular structure and functioning were observed at 48 and 72 hours after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest doses of caffeine, IBMX and pentoxifylline (used for pain in peripheral artery disease) showed the greatest percent of morphological defects in embryos. Cardiovascular structural alterations occurred in 20-40% of embryos when exposed to the highest dose of methylxanthines except for diprophylline and etophylline, two drugs used to treat respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10066&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10066&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Zebrafish-embryo-morphology-300x192.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Zebrafish embryo morphology&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of the methylxanthines also increased heart rate in normal looking embryos at 48 hours after fertilization but returned to normal 24 hours after this. These data show that a single early exposure of methylxanthines can have toxic effects on body morphology, cardiovascular structures, and cardiovascular functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to examine whether these effects can translate to higher order species especially to placental mammals since the complex mother-placenta-fetus relationship may prevent certain drugs from passing from the mother to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/27/drug-related-deaths-learning-from-the-past/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Fotolia_85982322_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 saw, for the third consecutive year, the highest number of drug related deaths ever recorded in Scotland. In that year, 867 people lost their lives to drugs. This amounts to a 23% rise on 2015, and more than double the number of deaths of ten years ago (421 in 2006). Rates have continued to rise since the 1990s and they continue to contribute to Scotland’s higher mortality rates overall, relative to the rest of Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1980s, less and less of this higher mortality could be explained by association with deprivation alone. It has been proposed that this could be because the social, economic and political contexts of the 1980s created a delayed negative health impact. Indeed, we have found this to be the case for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/jech/early/2016/07/18/jech-2016-207296.full.pdf&quot;&gt;trends in suicide in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, which also rose in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born between around 1960 and 1980 did experience a higher risk of drug-related deaths since the 1990s, and the group at highest risk were males living in the most deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Drugs-and-Alcohol-Misuse/Publications/2014-10-28/2014-10-28-Drug-Prevalence-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that problem drug use is related to social circumstances, with job loss, poverty, Adverse Childhood Experiences and trauma all being factors. We therefore set out to determine whether Scotland’s trend in drug-related deaths could be explained by a group of people who were young adults of working age in Scotland and had been exposed to the changing social, economic and political contexts of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5267-2&quot;&gt;Our research, published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that this is likely to be the case. Those born between around 1960 and 1980 did experience a higher risk of drug-related deaths since the 1990s (when they were working age), and the group at highest risk were males living in the most deprived areas. The impact of this effect can be seen over the years as this group of people get older, carrying their greater risk of drug-related death with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the combination of social and economic policies that lead to a rapid rise in income inequality, an increase in unemployment, inadequate housing, poor employment conditions and a negative social context, have serious consequences for health and could account for the higher risk of drug related deaths in this generation of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting this group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what of the people who were subject to these past policies, who are older now, and who carry an increased risk of drug-related death? It is paramount that they have available to them additional support to take account of the impact that these circumstances have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full impact of the excess mortality in the generation with high drug-related deaths is unlikely to be known for some time. But we know it already represents the deaths of hundreds of people prematurely; half of the current estimated population of 61,500 people in Scotland with drug problems is over 35 years old (considered to be older drug users) and older drug users accounted for almost three quarters (71%) of drug–related deaths in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this group of people continues to age, drugs services will need to adapt to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this group of people continues to age, drugs services will need to adapt to their needs as co-morbidities from chronic conditions associated with ageing and drug use become more prevalent. It is estimated, for example, that prolonged problematic drug use adds about 15 years’ additional physiological health damage. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sdf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Working-group-report-OPDPs-in-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found that older people with drug problems report experiencing stigma, loneliness and isolation. These act as barriers to seeking support and accessing services, preventing individuals from addressing the harms they experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a need to specifically tailor or adapt, as well as design services to meet the distinct medical, psychological, and social needs such as housing, social security and support services, of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for current drugs policy for Scotland? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, we should learn from the past and inform current and future policy to help prevent a further generation being at greater risk of drug-related deaths in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem drug use disproportionately affects people who experience socio-economic disadvantage. It is clear that social and economic policy has the potential to either improve, or harm health. On that basis, NHS Health Scotland believes that policy to reduce harm from drug use must take account of the wider things that impact on our health, like housing, work, income and social connectedness – the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-inequalities/the-right-to-health&quot;&gt;social determinants of health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an approach that puts improving health and reducing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-inequalities/what-are-health-inequalities&quot;&gt;health inequalities&lt;/a&gt; first, takes a non-punitive harm reduction approach to recovery, offers low-threshold services, tackles associated stigma and responds to individual need as well as addressing broader socio-economic circumstances that increase individuals’ vulnerability to problem drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing these wider social inequalities, and reducing poverty, will help play an important role in the prevention of drug misuse and a reduction in associated harms. As the research shows, for many who were exposed to social policy that did not do this, it’s too late for prevention. But what it also shows is that we can take action to reduce harm and prevent more deaths in this group, as well as taking action to ensure the social and economic policies of the future improve health and reduce health inequalities to prevent a repeat of the impact on the generation of the 1980s playing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a structure found on both sides of the brain in the temporal lobes, near the ears. It plays an important role in memory and thinking about the past and future. This led a team of researchers, led by Cornelia McCormick at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, to wonder if people with damage to both hippocampi are still capable of mind-wandering – after all, when we mind wander or day-dream, a lot of the time it is about things we’ve done or plan to do. And if these patients can mind wander, will the content of their mind-wandering thoughts be different from healthy controls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/11/2745&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers shadowed 6 male patients with bilateral hippocampus damage for two days during daylight hours, occasionally prompting them to report what they were thinking about, and compared their descriptions with those obtained from 12 age-matched healthy controls over the same period. The patients with hippocampus damage mind-wandered just as much as the controls, but the form and content of their mind-wandering was very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33536&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed the patients (who had small but highly specific lesions to the hippocampus, caused by a form of encephalitis) and controls while they were attending a psych lab for two days of brain scans and other tests. Twenty times during these eight-hour days, the researchers prompted the participants with the question: “What were you thinking about just before I asked you?”. They timed these prompts deliberately during quiet periods when mind-wandering might be especially likely, and immediately transcribed the participants’ answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding the answers, the researchers found extremely high rates of mind-wandering – defined as having thoughts disengaged from the outside world (or perceptually “decoupled”) – among both patients and controls, of around 80 to 90 per cent. The high rates of mind-wandering are not such a surprise, at least among the controls, because of the way the researchers had timed their prompts. For comparison, past research suggests that we mind-wander about 30 to 50 per cent of our waking lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the patients’ mind-wandering thoughts were very different from the healthy controls’. Whereas the controls’ mind-wandering was mostly episodic (about events past and present) and consisted of visual scenes, the patients’ mind-wandering was largely semantic (about facts) and verbal. “Small, selective lesions of their hippocampus dramatically affected the nature of their mind-wandering,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast in mind-wandering between patients and controls is in the context that on neuropsychological testing the hippocampus patients had impaired episodic memory, but performed normally in all other ways, including on tests of working memory, so it is highly unlikely they were simply unable to recall their mind-wandering thoughts. They also had no trouble recalling the nature of two other experiments they took part in, which covered similar time-scales to the mind-wandering research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from research with healthy people that mind-wandering depends on activity in a network of brain regions known as the “default mode network”, which includes the hippocampus. Also, people who report particularly rich and detailed mental time travel during mind-wandering tend to have stronger connectivity between their hippocampi and other key regions of the default mode network. However, this new study is the first to suggest strongly that an intact hippocampus is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for “normal” mind-wandering involving mental time travel and vivid visual scenes. The results also complement other research showing that hippocampus patients struggle to imagine the past and future when prompted to do so, revealing that this impairment extends to the content of their spontaneous thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By showing [that the hippocampus] plays a causal role in a phenomenon as ubiquitous as mind-wandering, this exposes the impact of the hippocampus beyond its traditionally perceived role in episodic memory, placing it at the centre or our everyday mental experiences,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/11/2745&quot;&gt;Mind-Wandering in People with Hippocampal Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Brain by Matt Wasser from the Noun Project&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quietly, stealthily, a new type of neuroscientist is taking shape. From within the myriad ranks of theorists have risen teams of neuroscientists that do science with data on neural activity, on the sparse splutterings of hundreds of neurons. Not the creation of methods for analysing data, though all do that too. Not the gathering of that data, for that requires another, formidable, skill set. But neuroscientists using the full gamut of modern computational techniques on that data to answer scientific questions about the brain. A neural data science has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out I’m one of them, this clan of neural data scientists. Accidentally. As far as I can tell, that’s how all scientific fields are born: accidentally. Researchers follow their noses, start doing new things, and suddenly find there’s a small crowd of them in the kitchen at parties (because it’s where the drinks are, in the fridge — scientists are smart). So here’s a little manifesto for neural data science: why it’s emerging, and how we might set about doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The why is the same as all areas of science that have spat out a data science: the amount of data is getting out of hand. For the science of recording lots of neurons, this data deluge has a scientific rationale, of sorts. Brains work by passing messages between neurons. Most of those messages take the form of tiny pulses of electricity: spikes, we call them. So to many it seems logical that if we want to understand how brains work (and when they don’t work) we need to capture all the messages being passed between all the neurons. And that means recording as many spikes from as many neurons as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby zebrafish brain has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MishaAhrens/status/899373164102287362?s=19&quot;&gt;about 130,000&lt;/a&gt; neurons, and at least 1 million connections between them; a bumblebee brain has about one million neurons. You can see how this would get out of hand very quickly. Right now we record somewhere between tens to a few hundred neurons at the same time with standard kit. At the limits are people recording a few thousand, and even a few getting tens of thousands (albeit these recordings capture neuron activity at rates much slower than the neurons could be sending their spikes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call this madness systems neuroscience: neuroscience, for the study of neurons; systems, for daring to record from more than one neuron at a time. And the data are mind-bendingly complex. What we have are tens to thousands of simultaneously recorded time-series, each the stream of spiking events (actual spikes, or some indirect measure thereof) from one neuron. By definition, they are not stationary, their statistics change over time. Their rates of activity spread over many orders of magnitude, from monk-like quiet contemplation to “drum kit in a wind tunnel”. And their patterns of activity range from clock-like regularity, to stuttering and spluttering, to alternating between bouts of mania and bouts of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now marry that to the behaviour of the animal you’ve recorded the neurons from. This behaviour is hundreds of trials of choices; or arm movements; or routes taken through an environment. Or the movement of a sense organ, or the entire posture of the musculature. Repeat for multiple animals. Possibly multiple brain regions. And sometimes whole brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no ground-truth. There isn’t a right answer; there are no training labels for the data, except the behaviour. We don’t know how brains encode behaviour. So we can do things with behavioural labels, but we almost always know these are not the answer. They are just clues to the “answer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systems neuroscience is then a rich playground for those who can marry their knowledge of neuroscience to their know-how for analysing data. A neural data science is being born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it — or could it be — done? Here’s a rough guide. The raison d’etre of the neural data scientist is to ask scientific questions of data from systems neuroscience; to ask: how do all these neurons work together to do their thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are roughly three ways we can answer that question. We can see these three ways by looking at the correspondence between established classes of problems in machine learning and computational challenges in systems neuroscience. Let’s start by looking at what we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have some data from &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; neurons that we’ve collected over time. We’ll lump these into a matrix we’ll call &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; — as many columns as neurons, and as many rows as time-points we’ve recorded (where it’s up to us how long a “time-point” lasts: we might make it short, and just have each entry record a 1 for a spike, and 0 otherwise. Or we might make it long, and each entry records the number of spikes during that elapsed time). Over that time, stuff has been happening in the world — including what the body has been doing. So let’s lump all that into a matrix we’ll call &lt;em&gt;S &lt;/em&gt;— as many columns as there are features in the world we care about, and as many rows as time-points we’ve recorded for those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, machine learning involves building three classes of models about the state of the world and the available data: generative, discriminative, and density. As a rough guide, this table shows how each class corresponds to a fundamental question in systems neuroscience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iE5yc6dFw3Kb769QTiUVBw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/ Density models &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt;: is there structure in the spikes? &lt;/strong&gt;Sounds dull. But actually this is key to great swathes of neuroscience research, in which we want to know the effect of something (a drug, a behaviour, a sleep) on the brain; in which we are asking: how has the structure of neural activity changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a recording of a bunch of neurons, we can answer this in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we can quantify the spike-train of each neuron, by measuring the statistics of each column of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, like the rate of spiking. And then ask: what is the model &lt;em&gt;P(X) &lt;/em&gt;for these statistics? We can cluster these statistics to find “types” of neuron; or simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008212001505?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;fit models to their entire joint distribution&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, we have some model of the data structure at the granularity of single neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we can create generative models of the entire population’s activity, using the rows of &lt;em&gt;X — &lt;/em&gt;the vectors of the moment-to-moment activity of the whole population. Such models typically aim to understand how much of the structure of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; can be recreated from just a few constraints, whether they be the distribution of how many vectors have how many spikes; or the pairwise correlations between neurons; or combinations thereof. These are particularly useful for working out if there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28783140/&quot;&gt;any special sauce&lt;/a&gt; in the population’s activity, if it is anything more than the collective activity of a set of independent or boringly simple neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, we can take the position that the neural activity in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is some high dimensional realisation of a low dimensional space, where the number of dimensions &lt;em&gt;D &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n.&lt;/em&gt; Typically we mean by this: some neurons in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are correlated, so we don’t need to use the whole of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; to understand the population — instead we can replace them with a much simpler representation. We might cluster the time-series directly, so decomposing &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; into a set of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; smaller matrices &lt;em&gt;X_1&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;X_N&lt;/em&gt;, each of which has (relatively) strong correlations within it, and so can be treated independently. Or we might use some kind of dimension reduction approach like Principal Components Analysis, to get a small set of time-series that each describes one dominant form of variation in the population’s activity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can do more than this. The above assumes we want to use dimension reduction to collapse neurons — that we apply reduction to the columns of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. But we could just as easily collapse time, by applying dimension reduction to the rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than asking if neural activity is redundant, this is asking if different moments in time have similar patterns of neural activity. If there are only a handful of these, clearly the dynamics of the recorded neurons are very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can throw in dynamical systems approaches here too. Here we try to fit simple models to the changes in &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;over time (i.e. mapping from one row to the next), and use those models to quantify the types of dynamics &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; contains — using terms like “attractor”, “separatrix”, “saddle node”, “pitchfork bifurcation”, and “the Arsenal collapse” (only one of those is not a real thing). One might plausibly argue the dynamical models so fitted are all density models &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt;, as they describe the structure of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell, we could even try and fit an entire dynamical model of a neural circuit, a bunch of differential equations describing each neuron, to &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, so that our model &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt; is then sampled every time we run the model from different initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these density models, we can fit them separately to the neural activity we recorded in a bunch of different states (&lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt;,…, &lt;em&gt;Sm&lt;/em&gt;), and answer questions like: how does the structure of a population of neurons change between sleeping and waking? Or during development of the animal? Or in the course of learning a task (where &lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt; might be trial 1, and &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt; trial 2; or &lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt; is session 1 and &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt; session 2; or many combinations thereof). We can also ask: how many dimensions does neuron activity span? Are the dimensions different between different regions of cortex? And has anyone seen my keys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ Generative models P(X|S): what causes a spike?&lt;/strong&gt; Now we’re talking. Things like linear-nonlinear models, or generalised linear models. Typically these models are applied to single neurons, to each column of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. With them we are fitting a model that uses the state of the world &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; as input, and spits out a neural activity series that matches the neuron’s activity as closely as possible. By then inspecting the weighting given to each feature of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; in reproducing the neuron’s activity, we can work out what that neuron appears to give a damn about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might want to chose a model that has some flexibility in what counts as “the state of the world”. We can include the neuron’s own past activity as a feature, and see if it cares about what it did in the past. For some types of neuron, the answer is yes. Bursting can take a lot out of a neuron, and it needs to lie down for a wee rest before it can go again. We can also think more broadly, and include the rest of the population — the rest of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; — as part of the state of the world &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; while the neuron is firing. After all, neurons occasionally influence each others’ firing, or so I’m led to believe. So there is a tiny chance that the response of a neuron in visual cortex is not &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; driven by the orientation of an edge in the outside world, but may also depend on what the 10000 cortical neurons connecting to it are also doing. What we then learn is the approximately most influential neurons in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to apply these generative models to single neurons. We can equally apply them to our density models; we can ask what each cluster, or dimension, is encoding about the world. Or, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/27342&quot;&gt;as some people did here&lt;/a&gt;, we can use the density model itself as the state of the world, and ask what features of that model downstream neurons give a damn about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of questions we can answer with these generative models are pretty obvious: what combination of features best predict a neuron’s response? Are there neurons selective for just one thing? How do neurons influence each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Discriminative models &lt;em&gt;P(S|X)&lt;/em&gt;: what information do spikes carry?&lt;/strong&gt; This is a core question in systems neuroscience as it is the challenge faced by all neurons that are downstream from our recorded population — all neurons that receive inputs from the neurons we recorded from and stuffed in our matrix &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. For those downstream neurons must infer what they need to know about the external world based solely on spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we can use standard classifiers, that map inputs onto labelled outputs. We can use the rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; as input, each a snapshot of the population’s activity, and attempt to predict one, some, or all of the features in the corresponding rows of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;. Possibly with some time delay, so we use row &lt;em&gt;X_t&lt;/em&gt; to predict the state &lt;em&gt;S_t-n &lt;/em&gt;that was &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; steps in the past if we’re interested in how populations code states that are input to the brain; or we can use row &lt;em&gt;X_t&lt;/em&gt; to predict the state &lt;em&gt;S_t+n &lt;/em&gt;that is &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; steps in the future if we’re interested in how populations code for some effect of the brain on the world. Like the activity in motor cortex that is happening before I type each letter right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, we take some (but not all, for we do not overfit) rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, and train the classifier to find the best possible mapping of &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;to the corresponding chunk of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;. Then we test the classifier on how well it can predict the rest of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from the corresponding rest of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re extraordinarily lucky, your &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; could be so long that you’re able to divide them into train, test, and validate sets. Keep the last in a locked box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could of course use as powerful a classifier as we like. From logistic regression, through Bayesian approaches, to using a 23 layer neural network. It rather depends on what you want out of the answer, and the trade-off between interpretability and power you’re comfortable with. My writings elsewhere have made it plain which side of this trade-off I tend to favour. But I’m happy to be proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encoding models of neurons are insightful, but touch on some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/168237&quot;&gt;old and deep philosophical quandaries&lt;/a&gt;. Testing encoding using a discriminative model assumes that something downstream is trying to decode &lt;em&gt;S &lt;/em&gt;from neural activity. There are two problems with this. Neurons do not decode; neurons take in spikes as input and output their own spikes. Rather, they &lt;strong&gt;re-code&lt;/strong&gt;, from one set of spikes into another set of spikes: perhaps fewer, or slower; perhaps more, or faster; perhaps from a steady stream into an oscillation. So discriminative models are more accurately asking what information our neurons are re-coding. But even if we take this view, there’s a deeper problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With very few exceptions, there is no such thing as a “downstream” neuron. The neurons we recorded in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are part of the intricately wired brain, full of endless loops; their output affects their own input. Worse, some of the neurons in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are downstream from the others: some of them input directly to the others. Because, as noted above, neurons influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rough, perhaps useful, manifesto for a neural data science. It is incomplete; no doubt something above is wrong (answers on a postcard to the usual address). The above is an attempt to synthesise the work of a group of labs with very disparate interests, but a common drive to use these kinds of model on big sets of neural data to answer deep questions about how brains work. Many of these are data labs, teams that analyse experimental data to answer their own questions; to name a few — Johnathan Pillow; Christian Machens; Konrad Kording; Kanaka Rajan; John Cunningham; Adrienne Fairhall; Philip Berens; Cian O’Donnell; Il Memming Park; Jakob Macke; Gasper Tkacik; Oliver Marre. Um, me. Others are experimental labs with strong data science inclinations: Anne Churchland; Mark Churchland; Nicole Rust; Krishna Shenoy; Carlos Brody; many others I apologise for not naming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are conferences where this kind of work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_18&quot;&gt;is welcomed&lt;/a&gt;, nay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/conferences-meetings/isn2017/&quot;&gt;even encouraged&lt;/a&gt;. A journal for neural data science is on its way. Something is building. Come on in, the data’s lovely*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* yeah I had to refer to data as a singular to get that crap joke to work. The fact I’m writing this footnote to explain this will give you some idea of the fastidious attention to detail neural data scientists expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=d7e3969086f2&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2&quot;&gt;A neural data science: how and why&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Brain Blogger: Different Coping Styles May Cause, Prevent, or Treat OCD</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/03/26/different-coping-styles-may-cause-prevent-or-treat-ocd/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2006/05/09/studies-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-linked-to-exaggerated-perception-of-error-in-brain/&quot;&gt;OCD&lt;/a&gt;) tend to fall back on maladaptive coping strategies such as rumination and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/09/controlling-intrusive-thoughts-suppress-repress-or-accept/&quot;&gt;thought suppression&lt;/a&gt;, according to new research; even though adaptive coping skills such as acceptance and problem-solving could improve their quality of life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many OCD patients tend to lack those adaptive coping skills while in the throes of the disorder, according to a new German study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Therapy and Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCD is a complex psychological condition in which the patient suffers from persistent unwanted thoughts and high levels of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. The disorder can lead to a severe reduction in one’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers compared the behavior of 60 patients with OCD to a group of 110 people with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; as well as a control group of 1,050 adults. All participants completed anonymous online surveys in which they reported their medical and psychological histories, along with their levels of compulsivity and abilities to cope in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also answered a questionnaire that covered different adaptive and maladaptive coping styles that one might use to deal with difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed the Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Styles Questionnaire (MAX) that had been recently developed by the researchers. This questionnaire measures coping styles using three dimensions: maladaptive coping (thought suppression, rumination), adaptive coping (problem-solving, acceptance), and avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants gave information about the coping strategies they use against their OCD symptoms such as problem-solving and rumination, as well as other coping styles that have recently been adopted in therapy, such as acceptance and suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with OCD were found to possess more maladaptive coping skills than all of the other participants, including those suffering from depression. They also possessed fewer functional skills to help them cope and adapt. Those who lacked adaptive coping skills were more likely to have poor insight into their condition and a resistance to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As put by the study leader, Dr. Steffen Moritz from the University Hospital Hamburg in Germany:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients with OCD are characterized by both more maladaptive coping and less adaptive coping relative to controls. Coping skills are important for many aspects of daily life beyond mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching children skills such as how to cope with bullying at school, poor performance or problems with their parents, for example, in the framework of general cognitive preventative treatment and resilience training in school, may help children to better deal with emotional turmoil and challenging situations during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also prevent the progression of a vulnerability to later obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression as well as other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the findings highlight some of the skills that patients with OCD lack, Moritz says further research is needed to find out to what extent improving such coping skills during childhood and adolescence through &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/&quot;&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) or similar interventions may indeed improve an OCD patient’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618755704?journalCode=ppsa&quot;&gt;pre-registered mass replication attempt&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; has raised doubts about another celebrated psychology finding. The collaboration between 40 laboratories found scant evidence for the so-called “Professor Prime”, undermining the famous finding that when people imagined themselves as a professor rather than a football hooligan it led them to perform better on a trivia quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-01060-003&quot;&gt;published in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, the Dutch researchers Ap Dijksterhuis and Daan Van Knippenberg asked participants to spend five minutes writing about themselves as if they were a professor or a football hooligan, thus priming them with one concept or the other. Next, the participants completed an unrelated trivia test of twenty questions, and those primed with the professor concept achieved an average of two and a half more correct answers  – a 13 per cent advantage – versus those in the hooligan condition. The authors concluded that “priming a stereotype or trait leads to complex overt behavior in line with this activated stereotype or trait”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was part of an exciting new wave of research that moved beyond earlier priming studies that had focused on how “primes” make it easier to recognise related concepts (e.g. encountering the prime word “football” makes us quicker to recognise related words like “goal” or “game”). The field became animated by so-called “social priming” claims, like John Bargh’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-06400-003&quot;&gt;classic study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested priming the concept of elderliness led participants to walk away from the lab more slowly (a finding that other labs failed to replicate, helping to spark the so-called replication crisis in psychology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst this crisis, until now the Professor Prime finding – perhaps the kingpin of these effects – was still standing (even if lampooned by, among others, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrPrimestei&quot;&gt;Dr Primestein Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;). The effect became the focus of this latest mass replication attempt (known as a “registered replication report”) when, in a great example of collaborative science, Dijksterhuis and Van Knippenberg volunteered their study as the latest to face scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to releasing their original materials to the other participating labs, Dijksterhuis and Van Knippenberg re-ran their own study and found a smaller effect than they had previously, and one that was confined to male participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure followed by the other 40 labs was almost identical to the original, except they used a new set of 30 trivia questions pretested to ensure a useful range of difficulty. Unlike the original, they also preregistered their stopping conditions (at what point they would cease looking for further participants; selective stopping is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/&quot;&gt;questionable research practice&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to misrepresentation of experimental effects). The labs also aimed for a gender balance between participants, which only 23 of them achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the original study showed a 13 per cent advantage to participants who got the Professor Prime, the average effect achieved by 23 labs involving over 5,500 participants found an advantage of just 0.014 per cent – almost 100 times weaker – and the variability across studies meant that this tiny effect was not statistically significant. Restricting the analysis to only male participants made no difference, and when the data from all 40 labs was included (i.e. also including those with a gender bias in their sample), the effect was even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only hint of an effect came after the researchers excluded anyone who thought the priming task was in any way linked to the trivia task – which was two thirds of the participants – in which case the Professor Prime was associated with a 2 per cent advantage. This is still much smaller than the original and there must be doubts about the meaningfulness of a small effect that is present only in a minority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to see this as anything other than yet another serious blow to the social priming literature. But it’s also a success for non-adversarial science – an example of psychology cleaning up its issues and coming to a better understanding of the effects that matter enough for us to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXVIII)The Bayesian brain</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxviiithe-bayesian-brain/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our sensors give us an incomplete, noisy, and indirect information about the world. For example, estimating the location of a sound source is difficult because in natural contexts, the sound of interest is corrupted by other sound sources, reflections, etc. Thus it is not possible to know the position of the source with certainty. The ‘Bayesian coding hypothesis’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15541511&quot;&gt;Knill &amp;amp; Pouget, 2014&lt;/a&gt;) postulates that the brain represents not the most likely position, but the entire probability distribution of the position. It then uses those distributions to do Bayesian inference, for example, when combining different sources of information (say, auditory and visual). This would allow the brain to optimally infer the most likely position. There is indeed some evidence for optimal inference in psychophysical experiments – although there is also some contradicting evidence (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/suboptimality-in-perceptual-decision-making/F0F0F136CA71A23F2DF3BC3E2ED4297B&quot;&gt;Rahnev &amp;amp; Denison, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea has some appeal. The problem is that, by framing perception as a statistical inference problem, it focuses on the most trivial type of uncertainty, statistical uncertainty. It is illustrated by the following quote: “The fundamental concept behind the Bayesian approach to perceptual computations is that the information provided by a set of sensory data about the world is represented by a conditional probability density function over the set of unknown variables”. Implicit in this representation is a particular model, for which variables are defined. Typically, one model describes a particular experimental situation. For example, the model would describe the distribution of auditory cues associated with the position of the sound source. Another situation would be described by a different model, for example one with two sound sources would require a model with two variables. Or if the listening environment is a room and the size of that room might vary, then we would need a model with the dimensions of the room as variables. In any of these cases where we have identified and fixed parametric sources of variation, then the Bayesian approach works fine, because we are indeed facing a problem of statistical inference. But that framework doesn’t fit any real life situation. In real life, perceptual scenes have variable structure, which corresponds to the model in statistical inference (there is one source, or two sources, we are in a room, the second source comes from the window, etc). The perceptual problem is therefore not just to infer the parameters of the model (dimensions of the room etc), but also the model itself, its structure. Thus, it is not possible in general to represent an auditory scene by a probability distribution on a set of parameters, because the very notion of a parameter already assumes that the structure of the scene is known and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferring parameters for a known statistical model is relatively easy. What is really difficult, and is still challenging for machine learning algorithms today, is to identify the structure of a perceptual scene, what constitutes an object (object formation), how objects are related to each other (scene analysis). These fundamental perceptual processes do not exist in the Bayesian brain. This touches on two very different types of uncertainty: statistical uncertainty, variations that can be interpreted and expected in the framework of a model; and epistemic uncertainty,  the model is unknown (the difference has been famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk&quot;&gt;explained by Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the “Bayesian brain” idea addresses an interesting problem (statistical inference), but it trivializes the problem of perception, by missing the fact that the real challenge is epistemic uncertainty (building a perceptual model), not statistical uncertainty (tuning the parameters): the world is not noisy, it is complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These are leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores of the Neotropics, collecting leaves and flowers they feed to a fungus crop they cultivate in underground chambers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symbiosis is similar to our own agriculture in many ways: the ants are obligately dependent on the fungus for food, they fertilize it using material they collect, and even use antibiotics to treat fungus garden diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mutualistic relationship has long drawn the attention of scientists trying to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation between organisms across kingdoms of life. However, these ants are also fascinating because of their unique mating biology, and because the queens are extraordinarily long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mating idiosyncrasies of leaf-cutting ants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A queen can live for two or three decades, during which she will never re-mate, but will prudently use the sperm from these males to fertilize millions of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaf-cutting ant queens mate during a single mating event early in adult life. When a queen embarks on a mating flight, she will mate with multiple male partners, and return to the ground to shed her wings and seek a suitable place to burrow a nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while the males drop dead almost immediately after they have delivered sperm to queens, a queen can live for two or three decades, during which she will never re-mate, but will prudently use the sperm from these males — stored in a specialized organ called the spermatheca — to fertilize millions of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such lengthy sperm storage represents a record in the animal kingdom, and creates an exceptional lifetime commitment between partners — it would be analogous to vertebrate females being constantly pregnant with sperm of a few males that need to be kept alive at ambient temperature and protected from senescence mechanisms for years after the male partners are dead and gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since multiple males inseminate a leaf-cutting ant queen in a single afternoon, the spermatozoa of different males compete for storage in the queen spermatheca. This interplay between competition for storage and the need to remain alive for many years after storage has created unique evolutionary adaptations in ant sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unravelling reproductive conflicts in ants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fertility research in vertebrates has firmly established that sperm are capable of responding to subtle changes in their surroundings, allowing them to reach and fertilize female eggs more effectively. These can be changes in pH, ion concentrations or temperature of reproductive tracts and glandular secretions, or the presence of specific molecules that attract sperm to fertilization sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adapting an experimental procedure to quantify sperm motility normally used in vertebrate studies, we discovered that ant sperm are able to do the same: not only do a greater proportion of sperm become motile and swim faster when in contact with secretions of male and queen reproductive organs, but they do so differently depending on whether these secretions belong to themselves, or to queens and rival males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first noticed that when ejaculates from different males are mixed, sperm motility increases compared to when the same ejaculates swim individually. To identify the factors inducing these increases, we performed additional experiments by collecting sperm from a focal male and making them swim in seminal fluid from the same male, from a rival male, or in secretions from different compartments of the queen reproductive organs, as well as mixes of these various fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that, compared to a saline control, the seminal fluid that is ejaculated together with sperm enhanced motility, and that motility was further increased as soon as these sperm came into contact with either the seminal fluid of a rival male or fluid contained in a queen’s spermatheca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, from the perspective of the focal sperm, both the rival male seminal fluid and queen spermathecal fluid are secretions from non-self tissue, we concluded that the sperm must respond to molecules present in non-self secretions and regulate motility accordingly — a response that makes sense when the presence of rival ejaculates means that racing for storage will increase a male’s reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do sperm differentiate between own and alien secretions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperm could potentially become maximally mobile as soon as they are inseminated in a queen, independently of the presence of any competing sperm, so why do they swim slower in their own seminal fluid? Expressing a recognition mechanism to differentiate between self and non-self is presumably costly, so our observations require an evolutionary explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a trade-off between the increased motility required to win the competitive race for storage and the long-term survival of sperm once they are in storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that this recognition evolved because sustaining sperm motility is energetically expensive and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sperm are particularly susceptible to structural damage incurred by ROS because they lack extensive damage repair mechanisms, meaning that any increase in ROS will likely lead to irreversible loss of sperm fertilization capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there may be a trade-off between the increased motility required to win the competitive race for storage and the long-term survival of sperm once they are in storage — important because it may be many years before they are used to fertilize eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from multiple studies suggest ROS damage control is a key factor in maintaining sperm viability — queens of multiple ant and bee species upregulate anti-oxidative enzymes after sperm storage, and these enzymes are also abundant in their seminal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to shed further light upon the evolutionary dilemma of how ants ensure long-term sperm survival in spite of costly sperm competition, future research should try to measure the ROS production associated with sperm motility more explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a brief video telling students that it’s possible to improve their intelligence and abilities make much difference to their educational outcomes? And if fostering a “growth mindset” in this way does make a difference, does it benefit all students and schools equally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on growth mindset over the past twenty years has progressed from experiments in a laboratory into real world settings, such as classrooms. This has shown that having a growth mindset leads to a small but positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/do-students-with-a-growth-mindset-get-better-grades&quot;&gt;improvement in grades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/08/a-30-minute-lesson-in-the-malleability-of-personality-has-long-term-benefits-for-anxious-depressed-teenagers/&quot;&gt;better mental health.&lt;/a&gt; But to date, little work has examined whether a brief mindset intervention is likely to help some adolescents more than others, especially those at greater risk of poor outcomes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to rectify this, 23 of the leading researchers in this field, including the likes of Carol Dweck, Angela Duckworth and David Yeager, recently collaborated on a large study which they released briefly as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/md2qa&quot;&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; (they are now revising the manuscript pending submission to peer review). As a Chartered Psychologist who delivers mindset workshops, I believe the preliminary findings are extremely promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33510&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 12,542 ninth grade students aged 14 to 15-years-old from 65 different US schools. They watched two 25-minute videos, roughly twenty days apart, early in the school year. Half the students, randomly determined, watched two growth mindset videos featuring clips about the brain that explained that intellectual abilities are not fixed but can be developed. The other half of the students acted as the control group and watched two videos about the brain in general but unrelated to growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers took several steps to ensure scientific rigour. This was possibly because of the recent issues in psychology around &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;failed replications of other studies&lt;/a&gt; or to avoid any accusations of bias. This included pre-registering their hypothesis and having an independent third party recruit the sample and administer the intervention. Finally, neither the students, teachers, nor the people analysing the data knew who had been in the intervention and who had been in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those students who received the growth mindset intervention went on to achieve higher grades at the end of the school year than the controls (a .03 grade point difference, on average). Furthermore, and as they predicted, the researchers found that the intervention’s effect was most pronounced for struggling students, who achieved .08 more grade points on average compared with struggling students in the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the growth mindset students were 3 per cent less likely to fall into the “poor performance threshold” with GPAs in the D or F range than those in the control group – putting them  “on a new trajectory” in the researchers’ words, and reducing the likelihood of their graduation being delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are struggling students more likely to benefit from this sort of intervention? The researchers suggest that high achieving students “may already have habits (e.g. turning in work on time) or beliefs (e.g. a growth mindset) that lead to higher grades”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth mindset intervention also had different positive outcomes depending on which school the students went to. For struggling students that went to a school that was not in the top 25 per cent for academic performance, the intervention had a positive impact on their grades. Students who attended high achieving schools did not get a boost to grades but were more likely to choose more challenging courses the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, students who attended schools with a culture that endorses high expectations and academic effort benefited most from the intervention. This suggests that if students receive a growth mindset message but feel that it is at odds with the practices, behaviour and ethos of the school, it is unlikely to have much impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the pertinent practical considerations from this study is not to do with magnitude of the intervention’s initial effect (which at three percentage points with regards to graduation doesn’t sound huge at first), but rather the impact of the intervention relative to the time, cost and effort it takes to implement it, and how it can potentially change the trajectory that a young person is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to this, the authors made three points worth considering. First, the intervention lasted under an hour. Second, it was very cheap, especially when compared against other types of interventions that have achieved a similar impact. For example, they note that a supplementary literacy course cost £2,000 per student. Third, because the intervention was delivered online, it is highly scaleable – the researchers estimate that rolling out the intervention nationwide would benefit approximately 98,000 students across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that their findings “illustrate the power of even slight adjustments in motivational priorities to create enduring change during adolescence”. Given that shifting the needle on student achievement and graduation rates is notoriously difficult, any intervention that is short, inexpensive and scalable is something definitely worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
