	<title>BMC Series blog: Systems Medicine: Computing the state of the body</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/03/16/systems-medicine-computing-state-body/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Genetic code&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Genomic-research-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Systems Medicine’ is a multidisciplinary field focused on unravelling, computing and integrating physiological and biochemical data, with the mission to develop a specially tailored system of information. As computer-based approaches become increasingly pervasive, not just in developed countries, but worldwide, the need to take physician-centred and patient-centred approaches in the design and development of this field becomes ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For roughly 50 years now, researchers and practitioners in computational and biomedical sciences have worked to formulate theory and practice that influences the direction of these approaches, and this diverse work makes up the field of Systems Medicine [1, 2]. Broadly speaking, it includes the study of what technology might be able to do for physicians and patients and how both parties might interact with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Good Practices are already in place, such as: the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), the E-Cell, as well as established educational curricula such as the MS Degree program in Georgetown University, USA and networking and society efforts, such as the European Association for Systems Medicine (EASyM) [3, 4, 5, 6]. This collection on ‘‘Systems Medicine’’ constitutes a significant milestone on an idea that stretches back through the vision posed by Allanson and Fairclough’s ‘‘A research agenda for physiological computing’’ [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of work planned in the thematic series is to provide a platform for a systemic approach, which avoids reductionism and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, immunological, gastrointestinal, etc.) [7, 8]. The results of any experiment require interpretation, especially when the data relate to systems as complex as living organisms. To be meaningful, the data has to fit within the family of ideas, principles or paradigms recognized by the field [9]. Biomedical data is most easily interpretable, for example, when it fits the expectations of a practicing physician, e.g. cardiologist; data that doesn’t fit these expectations often gets ignored [10]. Therefore, a computational reframing and establishment of good simulation practices, similar to the good clinical practices, will benefit medicine as a whole, if it allows physicians to incorporate into the field heretofore -unexpected or ill-fitting observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel character of computation in systems medicine seems to nurture the imagination and foster ingenuity. It is exhilarating to witness the inventiveness which is abundant in the biomedical computing field and the meaningful application of analysis tools that are being brought to bear on the fascinating challenges of the blend of medicine with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These editors’ writings have already helped me to get my bearings amid the concepts of digital health, orienting my perspective on even my own work. I look forward to furthering that educational process with the present volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would hence welcome submissions of original research articles (including systematic reviews and meta-analyses), but also methodology, software and database articles. This collection in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Systems Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will also include invited reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of manuscripts is 15th December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Stanley Rapoport hasn’t had much luck with his co-authors. Recently, we’ve reported on multiple retractions of papers co-authored by Rapoport after three different first authors were found to have committed misconduct. Now, the fallout from one of those cases had led to four more retractions, bringing Rapoport’s total to 12. The latest batch of retractions […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racism and prejudice are sometimes blatant, but often manifest in subtle ways. The current emblem of these subtle slights is the “microaggression”, a concept that has generated a large programme of research and launched itself into the popular consciousness – prompting last month’s decision by Merriam-Webster &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/microaggression-words-were-watching&quot;&gt;to add it to their dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new review in &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; by Scott Lilienfeld of Emory University argues that core empirical and conceptual questions about microaggressions remain unaddressed, meaning the struggle against them takes place on a confusing battlefield, one where it’s hard to tell between friend and foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20999&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a microaggression? First coined in the 1970s but rejuvenated in 2007 in a paper in the &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt; by Derald Wing Sue and colleagues, it originally referred only to racism but has expanded to a range of commonplace slights or hostility towards an oppressed group. The definition includes &lt;em&gt;microinvalidations&lt;/em&gt;, such as being told that a negative interaction couldn’t have been due to racist motives, and &lt;em&gt;microinsults&lt;/em&gt;, such as a teacher avoiding calling on you in class due to your gender, as well as a third class of &lt;em&gt;microassaults&lt;/em&gt;. The prototypical microaggression hides the offence within apparently innocent words or actions, which places those on the receiving end into a catch-22: swallow the indignity, or respond and risk being accused of overreaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems coherent on its face, but Lilienfeld argues there is an elastic nature to the definition, for example allowing Sue to assert that “the fact that psychological research has continued to inadequately address race and ethnicity…is in itself a microaggression.” In addition, items filed as microassaults include racial slurs and swastika graffiti; Lilienfeld argues that there is nothing micro about these events, so including them alongside the other examples muddies the waters and could spuriously make microaggressions appear culpable for harm, when the responsible party was old-fashioned abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that the edges of microaggression are poorly defined: ambiguity is baked into the entire concept. Advocates see this as a key feature, and claim that more ambiguous acts of prejudice are the most damaging, because they are the hardest to deal with – that aforementioned catch-22. (Sue again: “The invisibility of racial microaggressions may be more harmful to people of color than hate crimes or the covert and deliberate acts of White supremacists such as the Klan and Skinheads.”) Ambiguity can have its uses but the risk is that the concept becomes overly subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it could be that the experience of microaggressions is at least partially explained by a propensity to see fault or attack in statements. It could also be that the apparent impact of microaggressions on health or wellbeing is because people prone to negative emotionality (they score high on the trait of neuroticism) are more likely both to perceive microaggressions and to experience poorer health. One study did find an effect of microaggressions on negative moods and physical symptoms even after controlling for trait neuroticism, but the personality scale used in this study didn’t include any items related to proneness to feeling victimised, which seems an oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality having a hand in microaggression experience would also explain why some people from minority groups report no microaggressions when canvassed. The (limited) evidence that more ambiguous slights lead to more negative outcomes could also reflect the established psychological fact that in “weak” situations with no clear guidelines for action, people’s personality – in this case, their negative emotionality – tends to assert itself to fill in the interpretive gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilienfeld raises a lot of other issues we simply don’t have space for here: political assumptions, no measurement of base rates of everyday slights, inclusion criteria that limits participants to those who already buy into the concept to begin with, and the need to address whether people who commit microaggressions show other signs of a prejudicial mindset (something that research into the Implicit Affect test &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;has also struggled to demonstrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But he stresses that while he is not here to praise research into microaggression, nor is he here to bury it. He emphasises that many of these issues could be addressed by joining the microaggression field more closely with other more established areas of psychological research, and he offers a number of steps researchers could take to strengthen their research base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilienfeld also suggests we all consider putting aside the word microaggression in favour of “perceived racial slight” – because we don’t yet understand the role of interpretation due to personality, and because it simply isn’t clear that those using microaggressions are showing aggression as we usually understand the word. Putting aside the charged term, together with the “victim and perpetrator” parlance used by advocates and researchers, would allow us to affirm that these ambiguous events have a reality of their own, while recognising that the nature of that reality needs further investigation to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Conserving a behavior: a unique fish behaviour observed for the first – and last – time?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Grouper fig 1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-fig-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fishing for a unique behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well do we understand fish behaviour? Many fish species, in many habitats, have been extensively studied. Yet with the increasing impact of fishing and other human activities on the marine environment, we can question how much natural behaviour that would be observed in pristine environments has vanished from the areas we are actually able to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take fish mating behaviour. The classic pattern is of male and female fish gathering at spawning grounds, females releasing their eggs directly into the water, and males releasing their sperm to fertilise these eggs. Beyond these basic behaviours however, fish utilise a huge range of mating strategies, with individuals within a single species flexibly using different tactics depending on the situation and their own status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fish behave during mating will often depend on the density at which they gather at spawning grounds, with some mating tactics only seen when a considerable number of females have aggregated. Given how increasingly rare pristine spawning grounds are – especially for large, commercially fished species – we have to question how much mating behaviour we never see because these exploited species are never able to gather in sufficiently large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes research conducted on spawning aggregations in un-fished areas – if they can still be found – especially valuable, providing a critical opportunity to observe baseline behavior and determine what impact overfishing is having on natural mating practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the authors of an article &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0120-5&quot;&gt;recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to achieve. The researchers, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncf-india.org/people/rucha-karkarey&quot;&gt;Rucha Karkarey at the Nature Conservation Foundation in India&lt;/a&gt;, studied the squaretail grouper; a common species on coral reefs across the Indo-Pacific, very well studied, but heavily exploited by fisheries. With considerable effort, the researchers located an un-fished, pristine spawning ground and observed new mating behaviors never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8691&quot; style=&quot;width: 677px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A male grouper, showing the scars from past battles, guards his territory.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8691&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A male grouper, showing the scars from past battles, guards his territory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Rucha Karkarey&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Island Eden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted on Bitra, one of the most remote islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago, itself located a remote 400km south-west of the Indian coast. Bitra is a tiny island, home to just over 200 people, but crucially is surrounded by a substantial coral reef. Traditionally, local fishing has only been an artisanal enterprise, so the researchers hoped there was a good chance Bitra could be the place to observe an ‘untouched’ spawning aggregation of the squaretail grouper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on such a remote island was not without its challenges. The logistics of travelling to such a remote place and the difficulties of surveying the reefs meant it was several years before the researchers determined when the squaretail grouper gather to spawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific region, grouper spawn on the day of either the new moon or the full moon, depending on location and species. After several years of opportunistic surveys, and much questioning of local fishermen, the researchers determined that the new moon in January was when squaretailed groupers would gather in the largest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with this intelligence, the researchers set out to survey the reefs during the new moon of January in 2013 and 2014, hoping to see behavior never observed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moonless rendezvous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male grouper arrived at the spawning site up to three days before the new moon in order to establish territories. Females, easily distinguishable from males by their distended bellies, arrived the day prior to the new moon in large schools of 150-200 fish. After their arrival, the researchers surveyed the breeding ground through snorkelling and scuba diving, observing and videoing mating behaviours. As they had hoped, the grouper aggregation was substantial, containing the highest densities ever recorded for this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males made their territories on two types of habitat, either the slope of the reef or the reef shelf. Large males were much more common on the slope, with smaller males more likely to make their territories on the shelf; given the fierce competition between males to establish and defend territories, this implies that the reef slope provides the best mating grounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the majority of females gathered on the slope, where fish density was approx. six times higher than on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet unexpectedly, larger females seemed to prefer searching for mates among the smaller males on the reef shelf. Meanwhile, larger males on the slope were observed preferentially courting smaller females even when larger females were present. Among fish generally, it is common – and intuitive – for larger males to prefer larger females (who can produce more eggs) and vice versa. The inverse size-assortment seen in these large aggregations of grouper is a unique behaviour never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8690&quot; style=&quot;width: 648px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Courtship tactics. In image a. a school of females swim over the territory of a male. B. shows the 'traditional' pair-courtship behavior, as male displays to a female who has entered his territory. C &amp;amp; D show the newly observed school courtship behavior; two large males (circled in c.) make a foray into the female school, while in d. a group of females simultaneously spawn with a single male.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8690 size-full&quot; height=&quot;860&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-fig-1-full.jpg&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Courtship tactics. a. a school of females swim over a male’s territory. b. the ‘traditional’ pair-courtship behavior, as a male displays to a female who has entered his territory. c. &amp;amp; d. the newly observed school courtship behavior: two large males (circled in c.) make a foray into the female school, while in d. a group of females simultaneously spawn with a single male.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Karkarey et al. 2017&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just who the fish chose to mate with that surprised the researchers; &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they mated was unusual as well. The ‘classic’ squaretail grouper mating behaviour, commonly observed in other locations, is pair spawning. Here, a female will break away from her larger school and visit a male’s territory. The male courts her by approaching with a quivering motion, followed by a display of the underside of his body. If she’s impressed, the pair will release their eggs and sperm in a ‘spawning rush’ just above the male’s territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the large mating aggregations on the reefs around Bitra, the researchers also observed a second, never before seen, mating behaviour which they term ‘school-courtship’. Here, males made regular forays into the water above their territories, courting multiple females in a school before rapidly returning to their territory. This is distinct to the usual pair spawning in that it took place outside the male’s territory and involved a single male mating simultaneously with multiple females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the school-courtship strategy was very dependent on the size of a male and the location of its territory; only larger males with territories on the reef slope were observed using this novel tactic. For these males the tactic was highly successful, as they associated with three times more females than males using pair-courtship tactics. It came with a cost though; these males spent almost quadruple the time engaging in aggressive behaviour with other males to defend their territories. This newly discovered mating behavior seems to be very much a high-risk-high-reward tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above video shows an example of the unique school-spawning behavior. In the foreground, a male guards his territory in ‘traditional’ style. To the left, in the background, another male can be seen leaving his territory to make a foray into the school of females above. The male is seen courting multiple females in the school, followed by a sudden upward spawning rush between the male and 4–5 females from the school, proceeded by a release of gametes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paradise lost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the sting to this tale. During the course of their investigations, the researchers noted that a nascent but troubling commercial fishing industry had appeared on the reefs around Bitra. While not specifically targeting grouper, such an increase in fishing pressure clearly presents a threat to their breeding aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the researcher’s most recent data from 2015 and 2016 found an alarming 50% decline in peak aggregation compared to 2013 levels. Surveying the breeding schools in 2016 they were unable to observe a single instance of the novel school courtship behaviour. Is this unique behaviour to become extinct almost as soon as we have learnt of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the specific case of the squaretail grouper, these findings raise a wider concern about the perils of overfishing. Even if commercially exploited species are able to survive with sustainable populations (a big if for many species) we may still be eliminating unique and important behaviors that can only exist when fish are able to gather in large densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have potentially substantial effects on these species. In the squaretail grouper, the novel school-courtship behaviour is only used by the ‘best’ males (i.e. the largest individuals, able to obtain the best territories) and potentially substantially increases their mating success. This suggests that its elimination in overfished populations could have significant effects on the future demographics and evolution of the species. Even aside from this, isn’t there something tragic about seeing such unique and fascinating behaviour, the product of countless years of evolution, disappear from our oceans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope for the Bitra squaretail grouper. The researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncf-india.org/projects/aggregating-groupers&quot;&gt;presented their findings&lt;/a&gt; to the local community and sought their support in protecting the grouper. The response has been positive, with many even expressing a local pride that their island hosts an apparently unique natural phenomenon. With the cooperation of the Lakshadweep Fisheries Department and Administration they are attempting to establish a reserve that will ban commercial fishing in the grouper breeding areas in the few days around the January new moon. If these efforts are successful then perhaps the squaretail grouper will continue to display the full variety of their natural behaviour in at least one part of our vast oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: No WAVE, no reward: hope for addictive brains</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/PVqXQtEwm9A/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cocaine&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/03/Cocaine-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine is a common illicit drug of abuse which is able to strongly modify the brain. Cocaine-induced synaptic modifications are implicated in the neuronal adaptations underling addiction. Cocaine is able to increase the synaptic contents of dopamine (the “feel-good” chemical), by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) which is in charge for the synaptic re-uptake of the neurotransmitter. This massive increase in dopamine produces euphoria and pleasure. Despite several decades of efforts, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for cocaine-induced neuronal maladaptations are far from being completely understood and unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/6/1395.full.pdf&quot;&gt;PNAS article&lt;/a&gt;, the laboratory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2000/greengard-bio.html&quot;&gt;Paul Greengard&lt;/a&gt; (Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000) has revealed for the first time how a protein called WAVE1 is able to regulate the brain’s response to cocaine. Indeed, these results provide novel insights into the molecular functioning of the “addicted brain” and could lead to better interventions for treating addiction to cocaine and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We knew about the connection between WAVE1 and dopamine many years ago, but until now no one knew the mechanisms by which cocaine stimulates WAVE1 and how WAVE1 regulates cocaine’s actions&lt;/em&gt;” says Yong Kim, a Research Assistant Professor in Greengard’s lab and the senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the authors showed that WAVE1 was necessary to induce the rewarding and psychomotor effects of cocaine administration by knocking-down WAVE1 in the dopaminoceptive neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region highly involved in reward and motivation. However, it must be noted that the neurons of the NAc are not all the same. In fact, the nucleus accumbens is mainly composed of medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) which can be further subdivided depending on the expression of the dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) or the dopamine receptor 2 (D2R). We can then distinguish D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs. Surprisingly, cocaine-induced behavioral alterations were strongly reduced only when WAVE1 was genetically ablated in D1R-MSNs. However, this effect was not observed when WAVE1 was removed from cells containing the D2R, thus revealing new details about the neurobiological mechanisms of cocaine. In addition, the authors observed that WAVE1 phosphorylation was modulated by dopamine through its dopamine D1R receptor since pharmacological blockade of this specific receptor was able to block cocaine-induced WAVE1 post-translational modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this study also provides new evidence regarding the functional role of WAVE1 at the level of the brain’s synapses, the tiny junctions between neuronal cells through which impulses pass. The authors observed that WAVE1 activation is associated with morphological and functional decreases in excitatory synapses on specific D1R-MSNs. Importantly, “&lt;em&gt;certain polymorphisms in WAVE1 complex proteins in humans might contribute to vulnerability in functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses underlying addiction behavior such as cocaine craving and relapse&lt;/em&gt;”, say Ilaria Ceglia, the leading author of the study. Altogether the results suggest that this protein may play a critical role in providing a regulatory negative feedback at the level of specific excitatory synapses as a part of the cellular and molecular maladaptations induced by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It’s well known that cocaine increases the signaling of dopamine in the brain&lt;/em&gt;” Kim says. “&lt;em&gt;Understanding more about the mechanism of cocaine action is providing new insights into the neurobiology of addiction. Our eventual goal is to use these findings to find a way to develop a drug to treat addiction&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies will obviously be required to deeply understand all the molecular actors responsible for the psychostimulant effects induced by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

Beside allowing reports to be flexible and modified automatically, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; makes reproducible research simpler than manual approaches. When used properly, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; describes the steps of an experiment explicitly, and these steps are self-documented (by using R code). &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; itself is not complicated, however it does require some knowledge of the R language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be divided in two parts. In first part I will give a brief background to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt;. I will use second part of the talk to demonstrate several examples on how to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; to make a (dynamic) research paper.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience (XXV) - Are there biological models in computational neuroscience?</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxv-are-there-biological-models-in-computational-neuroscience/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-i-definitions-and-the-data-driven-approach/&quot;&gt;Computational neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; is the science of how the brain “computes”, that is, how the brain performs cognitive functions such as recognizing a face or walking. Here I will argue that most models of cognition developed in the field, especially as regards sensory systems, are actually not biological models but hybrid models consisting of a neural model together with an abstract model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, many neural models are not meant to be models of cognition. For example, there are models that are developed to explain the irregular spiking of cortical neurons, or oscillations. I will not consider them. According to the definition above, I categorize them in theoretical neuroscience rather than computational neuroscience. Here I consider for example models of perception, memory, motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example that I know well is the problem of localizing a sound source from timing cues. There are a number of models, including a spiking neuron model that we have developed (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000993&quot;&gt;Goodman and Brette, 2010&lt;/a&gt;). This model takes as input two sound waves, corresponding to the two monaural sounds produced by the sound source, and outputs the estimated direction of the source. But the neural model, of course, does not output a direction. Rather, the output of the neural model is the activity of a layer of neurons. In the model, we consider that direction is encoded by the identity of the maximally active neuron. In another popular model in the field, direction is encoded by the relative total activity of two groups of neurons (see our comparison of models in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/content/2/e01312&quot;&gt;Goodman et al. 2013&lt;/a&gt;). In all models, there is a final step which maps the activity of neurons to estimated sound location, and this step is not a neural model but an abstract model. This causes big epistemological problems when it comes to assessing and comparing the empirical value of models because a crucial part of the models is not physiological. Some argue that neurons are tuned to sound location; others that population activity varies systematically with sound location. Both are right, and thus none of these observations is a decisive argument to discriminate between the models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is seen in other sensory modalities. The output is the identity of a face; or of an odor; etc. The symmetrical situation occurs in motor control models: this time the abstract model is on the side of the input (mapping from spatial position to neural activity or neural input). Memory models face this situation twice, with abstract models both on the input (the thing to be memorized) and the output (the recall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, this situation has to do with the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xviii-representational-approaches-in-computational-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;most models in computational neuroscience take a representational approach&lt;/a&gt;: they describe how neural networks represent in their firing some aspect of the external world. The representational approach requires defining a mapping (called the “decoder”) from neural activity to objective properties of objects, and this mapping cannot be part of the neural model. Indeed, sound location is a property of objects and thus does not belong to the domain of neural activity. So no sound localization model can ever be purely neuronal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus to develop biological models, it is necessary to discard the representational approach. Instead of “encoding” things, neurons control the body; neurons are agents (rather than painters in the representational approach). For example, a model of sound localization should be a model of an orientational response, including the motor command. The model explains not how space is “represented”, but how an animal orients its head (for example) to a sound source. When we try to model an actual behavior, we find that the nature of the problem changes quite significantly. For example, because a particular behavior is an event, neural firing must also be seen as events. In this context, counting spikes and looking at the mutual information between the count and some stimulus property is not very meaningful. What matters is the events that the spikes trigger in the targets (muscles or other neurons). The goal is not to represent the sensory signals but to produce an appropriate behavior. One also realizes that the relation between sensory signals and actions is circular, and therefore &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xix-does-the-brain-process-information/&quot;&gt;cannot be adequately described as “processing”&lt;/a&gt;: sensory signals make you turn the head, but if you turn the head, the sensory signals change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, most models of cognition in computational neuroscience are not biological models. They include neuron models together with abstract models, a necessity stemming from the representational approach. To a make biological model requires including a model of the sensorimotor loop. I believe this is the path that the community should take.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/experience-blindness-echolocation-daniel-kish&quot;&gt;Daniel Kish’s life&lt;/a&gt; reads like the origins story out of a super hero comic book. To treat his cancer, doctors removed both Kish’s eyes when he was aged one. Later, as a child, he taught himself to echolocate like a bat. Using the echoes from his own clicking sounds he detects the world around him. He can even cycle busy streets and it’s his life’s mission to empower other blind children by teaching them echolocation or what he calls flashsonar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists studying the skill have found that it is eminently teachable, for blind people and the sighted. But what’s also become clear is that there is a huge amount of variation between individuals: some people, blind or sighted, seem to pick it up easily while others struggle. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-016-4833-z?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Experimental Brain Research&lt;/em&gt; is among the first to try to find out which mental abilities, if any, correlate with echolocation aptitude. The findings could help screening to see who is likely to benefit from echolocation and offer clues to how to help those who struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20880&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina Ekkel and her colleagues blindfolded 23 sighted undergrad participants and asked them to sit opposite a small acrylic disc and a large disc. One disc was always located higher than the other with the positions switched discreetly from trial to trial.  Each trial, the participants’ task was to identify the respective location of the discs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants wore a small speaker on their foreheads and on each echolocation trial, to help them locate the discs, they could press a button to emit a short burst of white noise from this speaker as many times as they wanted for up to 20 seconds (on average, the participants chose to make 2.7 sounds). On control trials they had to locate the discs without making any sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although participants were allowed to move their heads (doing so makes echolocation much more effective), five participants chose to always kept their heads still and they never performed any better than if they’d just guessed at random, so their data was omitted from further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as performing four sessions of the echolocation tests for one to two hours over two days, the remaining participants also completed tests of their cognitive abilities including: their spatial cognition (based on their ability to remember the location of shapes on a plate); their working memory (recalling lists of digits); and their sustained and divided attention (they took the “Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task/PASAT”: presented with a series of 60 single-digit numbers, they had to add each new number to the preceding one and state the sum out loud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the participants never performed better than chance in the control trials – they may as well have been guessing. In contrast, average correct performance across the echolocation trials was 63.2 per cent. There was also a clear training effect with performance in the fourth session clearly outstripping performance in the first. But consistent with past research, there were again large differences in individual aptitude: in the final sessions, the top performing participant managed 96 per cent accuracy versus 48 per cent achieved by the lowest performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing participants’ echolocation improvement with their performance on the other cognitive tests, only their sustained and divided attentional abilities were relevant. The higher participants scored on the PASAT attentional test, the more improvement they showed in echolocation. This makes sense if you consider the concentration that must be involved in using echolocation effectively. By contrast, participants’ scores on spatial cognition and working memory did not correlate with their echolocation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results add to past research that’s shown people who lose their sight earlier in life tend to find it easier to learn echolocation, perhaps because they’ve had more practice using other senses to compensate for their lack of sight. The new findings suggest that attentional abilities are another key factor that’s relevant. Screening based on attentional skills might help identify those most likely to benefit from echolocation training, or perhaps honing attention skills could be a useful adjunct to training in echolocation. For now all this is highly speculative: the present results were correlational (it’s not necessarily the case that attentional skills are directly relevant), and among things, we need to see if the results replicate in blind participants.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Machine learning reveals correlations of gene expression and outcomes in ovarian cancer</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Machine learning in the fight against cancer.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Genetic-data-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complexity of cancer has famously eluded conquering by modern medicine. Every tumor has many aberrations that drive its growth. As a result, treatments that target single vulnerabilities are typically of short-lived efficacy. After being diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer in 2013, I wagered that what was needed was an algorithm capable of digesting and analyzing the complexity to provide a detailed view into the multitude of factors at work in a given tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pursue this goal, I began a collaboration with Greg Ver Steeg, who specializes in analyzing big data, to bring state-of-the-art machine learning to bear on the recently released large-scale data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA contains publicly available comprehensive maps of the key genomic changes in 33 types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg previously developed a machine learning method called Correlation Explanation (CorEx) which we applied to TCGA tumor data. CorEx uses information-theoretic principles to find hidden factors that ‘explain’ relationships in the data. In our case, these factors account for dependencies (correlations) among tumor genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our initial discussions, it was clear that CorEx showed promise, but required refinement to squeeze as much information as possible out of noisy gene expression data. Subsequent innovations in this context allow CorEx to learn patterns efficiently from relatively small numbers of patient genomic profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg and I used the improved CorEx to find patterns in RNA-seq gene expression data for 420 ovarian tumors. CorEx was able to find an extraordinary amount of structure in the data, much of which was associated with known cellular functions and pathways. We identified genes whose expression seems to be linked in ovarian cancer and with all these expression dependencies mapped out, we could begin to ask how they fit into a larger framework for understanding of tumor biology and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8684&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Figure 1: Tree representation of CorEx groups annotated with Gene Ontology terms&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8684 size-large&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/figure-1-1024x885.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: Tree representation of CorEx groups annotated with Gene Ontology terms&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Towards targeted treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions we asked was how to combine treatments in order to extend patient survival. We were able to show that combinations of the CorEx factors (i.e. patterns of gene expression that CorEx identified) were significantly associated with survival among the TCGA patients. This suggests a method for selecting combination therapies based on these patterns for future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also asked whether any factors associate with long term survival (a particular concern for me!). One specific factor stood out as a candidate. It contained several proteins regulating stemness properties – such as the ability of cells to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types – that are implicated in aggressive metastatic disease and chemoresistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis shows that tumors containing many cells with stemlike gene expression correlate with poor long-term patient survival. CorEx is especially good at detecting weak correlations in large sets of variables, and this is likely why it was able to detect this particular pattern for the first time in ovarian cancer expression data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8685&quot; style=&quot;width: 1489px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Difference in 5-year survival by score for combined CorEx factors containing shown protein networks&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8685&quot; height=&quot;827&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Figure-2.png&quot; width=&quot;1479&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Difference in 5-year survival by score for combined CorEx factors containing shown protein networks&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are interesting general highlights, the real significance of our findings lies in CoreEx’s capacity to identify multiple target networks in an individual tumor. When I recurred less than a year after completing my initial chemotherapy, I was able to compare my tumor’s gene expression to patterns of gene expression CorEx had identified in the TCGA data. I noticed that the expression factors present in my tumor suggested a very favorable immune activation. Generally, this would predict a favorable response to chemotherapy, but unfortunately that had not been the initial outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this information from CorEx to select an unconventional second chemotherapy regimen including an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which allows immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg and my efforts have borne fruit: I am still alive and off therapy for 18+ months – a second remission that is at least twice as long as the first one, which is rare in recurrent ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we cannot be sure that the extended remission was due to my algorithm-driven treatment choices, what is certain is that some patients benefit greatly from personalized treatment options and there is a great need to expand this benefit to more patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the TCGA ovarian cancer RNA-seq presents a rich tableau of tumor biology, of which we have only scratched the surface. We expect deeper exploration of the various factors that drive individual tumor growth, spread and survival will yield further insights to inform more rational, targeted treatment selection. Although much further research is needed before this method can be widely applied, with an algorithm like CorEx that is capable of sorting out the daunting complexity of tumor cell biology, we are hopeful the tide will soon turn in more cancer patients’ favor.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Transmission of cytokinesis forces via E-cadherin dilution and actomyosin flows</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/qUn1UOU3VaY/nature22041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 During epithelial cytokinesis, the remodelling of adhesive cell–cell contacts between the dividing cell and its neighbours has profound roles in the integrity, arrangement and morphogenesis of proliferative tissues1–7. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, this remodelling requires the activity of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in the interphasic cells neighbouring the dividing cell1,3,5. However, the mechanisms coordinating cytokinesis and MyoII activity in the neighbours are unknown. Here we find that in the Drosophila notum epithelium, each cell division is associated with a mechano-sensing and transmission event controlling MyoII dynamics in the neighbours. We established that the ring pulling forces promote local junction elongation, resulting in local E-cadherin (E-Cad) dilution at the ingressing adherens junction (AJ). In turn, the reduction of E-Cad concentration and the contractility of the neighbouring cells promote self-organized actomyosin flows, ultimately leading to MyoII accumulation at the base of the ingressing AJ. While force transduction has been extensively studied in the context of AJ reinforcement to stabilize adhesive cell-cell contacts8, we propose an alternative mechano-sensing mechanism able to coordinate actomyosin dynamics between epithelial cells and to sustain AJ remodelling in response to mechanical forces.

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1UES02MC4s4/nature21710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The persistence of the HIV reservoir in infected individuals is a major obstacle to the development of a cure for HIV. Here, using an in vitro model of HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells, we reveal a gene expression signature of 103 upregulated genes that are specific for latently infected cells, including genes for 16 transmembrane proteins. In vitro screening for surface expression in HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells shows that the low-affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, CD32a, is the most highly induced, with no detectable expression in bystander cells. Notably, productive HIV-1 infection of T-cell-receptor-stimulated CD4 T cells is not associated with CD32a expression, suggesting that a quiescence-dependent mechanism is required for its induction. Using blood samples from HIV-1-positive participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, we identify a subpopulation of 0.012% of CD4 T cells that express CD32a and host up to three copies of HIV DNA per cell. This CD32a+ reservoir was highly enriched in inducible replication-competent proviruses and can be predominant in some participants. Our discovery that CD32a+ lymphocytes represent the elusive HIV-1 reservoir may lead to insights that will facilitate the specific targeting and elimination of this reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21710&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21710&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/1UES02MC4s4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

 Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline. A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed. However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages, in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250–1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations. These findings also support the idea that conservation interventions that increase floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season have positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 During 2015–2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: DND1 maintains germline stem cells via recruitment of the CCR4–NOT complex to target mRNAs</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kfl76S-bBRI/nature21690</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The vertebrate-conserved RNA-binding protein DND1 is required for the survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs), as well as the suppression of germ cell tumours in mice. Here we show that in mice DND1 binds a UU(A/U) trinucleotide motif predominantly in the 3′ untranslated regions of mRNA, and destabilizes target mRNAs through direct recruitment of the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the extent of suppression is dependent on the number of DND1-binding sites. This DND1-dependent mRNA destabilization is required for the survival of mouse PGCs and spermatogonial stem cells by suppressing apoptosis. The spectrum of target RNAs includes positive regulators of apoptosis and inflammation, and modulators of signalling pathways that regulate stem-cell pluripotency, including the TGFβ superfamily, all of which are aberrantly elevated in DND1-deficient PGCs. We propose that the induction of the post-transcriptional suppressor DND1 synergizes with concurrent transcriptional changes to ensure precise developmental transitions during cellular differentiation and maintenance of the germ line.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Autism gene Ube3a and seizures impair sociability by repressing VTA Cbln1</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/hzptxGYwoRk/nature21678</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Maternally inherited 15q11-13 chromosomal triplications cause a frequent and highly penetrant type of autism linked to increased gene dosages of UBE3A, which encodes a ubiquitin ligase with transcriptional co-regulatory functions. Here, using in vivo mouse genetics, we show that increasing UBE3A in the nucleus downregulates the glutamatergic synapse organizer Cbln1, which is needed for sociability in mice. Epileptic seizures also repress Cbln1 and are found to expose sociability impairments in mice with asymptomatic increases in UBE3A. This Ube3a–seizure synergy maps to glutamate neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), where Cbln1 deletions impair sociability and weaken glutamatergic transmission. We provide preclinical evidence that viral-vector-based chemogenetic activation of, or restoration of Cbln1 in, VTA glutamatergic neurons reverses the sociability deficits induced by Ube3a and/or seizures. Our results suggest that gene and seizure interactions in VTA glutamatergic neurons impair sociability by downregulating Cbln1, a key node in the expanding protein interaction network of autism genes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The true tempo of evolutionary radiation and decline revealed on the Hawaiian archipelago</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/MLcZGcP0gfE/nature21675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Establishing the relationship between rates of change in species richness and biotic and abiotic environmental change is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Although exquisite fossil and geological records provide insight in rare cases, most groups lack high-quality fossil records. Consequently, biologists typically rely on molecular phylogenies to study the diversity dynamics of clades, usually by correlating changes in diversification rate with environmental or trait shifts. However, inferences drawn from molecular phylogenies can be limited owing to the challenge of accounting for extinct species, making it difficult to accurately determine the underlying diversity dynamics that produce them. Here, using a geologically informed model of the relationship between changing island area and species richness for the Hawaiian archipelago, we infer the rates of species richness change for 14 endemic groups over their entire evolutionary histories without the need for fossil data, or molecular phylogenies. We find that these endemic clades underwent evolutionary radiations characterized by initially increasing rates of species accumulation, followed by slow-downs. In fact, for most groups on most islands, their time of evolutionary expansion has long past, and they are now undergoing previously unrecognized long-term evolutionary decline. Our results show how landscape dynamism can drive evolutionary dynamics over broad timescales, including driving species loss that is not readily detected using molecular phylogenies, or without a rich fossil record. We anticipate that examination of other clades where the relationship between environmental change and species richness change can be quantified will reveal that many other living groups have also experienced similarly complex evolutionary trajectories, including long-term and ongoing evolutionary decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21675&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21675&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/MLcZGcP0gfE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: RNA m6A methylation regulates the ultraviolet-induced DNA damage response</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/CI1z4VMof3s/nature21671</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Cell proliferation and survival require the faithful maintenance and propagation of genetic information, which are threatened by the ubiquitous sources of DNA damage present intracellularly and in the external environment. A system of DNA repair, called the DNA damage response, detects and repairs damaged DNA and prevents cell division until the repair is complete. Here we report that methylation at the 6 position of adenosine (m6A) in RNA is rapidly (within 2 min) and transiently induced at DNA damage sites in response to ultraviolet irradiation. This modification occurs on numerous poly(A)+ transcripts and is regulated by the methyltransferase METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) and the demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein). In the absence of METTL3 catalytic activity, cells showed delayed repair of ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine adducts and elevated sensitivity to ultraviolet, demonstrating the importance of m6A in the ultraviolet-responsive DNA damage response. Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the ultraviolet response, some of which resynthesize DNA after the lesion has been excised by the nucleotide excision repair pathway, while others participate in trans-lesion synthesis to allow replication past damaged lesions in S phase. DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ), which has been implicated in both nucleotide excision repair and trans-lesion synthesis, required the catalytic activity of METTL3 for immediate localization to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage sites. Importantly, Pol κ overexpression qualitatively suppressed the cyclobutane pyrimidine removal defect associated with METTL3 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a novel function for RNA m6A modification in the ultraviolet-induced DNA damage response, and our findings collectively support a model in which m6A RNA serves as a beacon for the selective, rapid recruitment of Pol κ to damage sites to facilitate repair and cell survival.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Plants live in biogeochemically diverse soils with diverse microbiota. Plant organs associate intimately with a subset of these microbes, and the structure of the microbial community can be altered by soil nutrient content. Plant-associated microbes can compete with the plant and with each other for nutrients, but may also carry traits that increase the productivity of the plant. It is unknown how the plant immune system coordinates microbial recognition with nutritional cues during microbiome assembly. Here we establish that a genetic network controlling the phosphate stress response influences the structure of the root microbiome community, even under non-stress phosphate conditions. We define a molecular mechanism regulating coordination between nutrition and defence in the presence of a synthetic bacterial community. We further demonstrate that the master transcriptional regulators of phosphate stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana also directly repress defence, consistent with plant prioritization of nutritional stress over defence. Our work will further efforts to define and deploy useful microbes to enhance plant performance.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Phytoplankton can actively diversify their migration strategy in response to turbulent cues</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8xWnpep1UbQ/nature21415</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Marine phytoplankton inhabit a dynamic environment where turbulence, together with nutrient and light availability, shapes species fitness, succession and selection. Many species of phytoplankton are motile and undertake diel vertical migrations to gain access to nutrient-rich deeper layers at night and well-lit surface waters during the day. Disruption of this migratory strategy by turbulence is considered to be an important cause of the succession between motile and non-motile species when conditions turn turbulent. However, this classical view neglects the possibility that motile species may actively respond to turbulent cues to avoid layers of strong turbulence. Here we report that phytoplankton, including raphidophytes and dinoflagellates, can actively diversify their migratory strategy in response to hydrodynamic cues characteristic of overturning by Kolmogorov-scale eddies. Upon experiencing repeated overturning with timescales and statistics representative of ocean turbulence, an upward-swimming population rapidly (5–60 min) splits into two subpopulations, one swimming upward and one swimming downward. Quantitative morphological analysis of the harmful-algal-bloom-forming raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo together with a model of cell mechanics revealed that this behaviour was accompanied by a modulation of the cells’ fore–aft asymmetry. The minute magnitude of the required modulation, sufficient to invert the preferential swimming direction of the cells, highlights the advanced level of control that phytoplankton can exert on their migratory behaviour. Together with observations of enhanced cellular stress after overturning and the typically deleterious effects of strong turbulence on motile phytoplankton, these results point to an active adaptation of H. akashiwo to increase the chance of evading turbulent layers by diversifying the direction of migration within the population, in a manner suggestive of evolutionary bet-hedging. This migratory behaviour relaxes the boundaries between the fluid dynamic niches of motile and non-motile phytoplankton, and highlights that rapid responses to hydrodynamic cues are important survival strategies for phytoplankton in the ocean.

	<title>Romain Brette: New chapter : Excitability of an isopotential membrane</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/new-chapter-excitability-of-an-isopotential-membrane/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have just uploaded a new chapter of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-book-on-the-theory-of-action-potentials/&quot;&gt;book on the theory of action potentials&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/theory-of-action-potentials-chapter-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Excitability of an isopotential membrane&lt;/a&gt;. In this chapter, I look mostly at the concept of spike threshold: the different ways to define it, its quantitative relation to different biophysical parameters (eg properties of sodium channels), and the conditions for its existence (eg a sufficient number of channels). This is closely related to my previous work on the threshold equation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850&quot;&gt;Platkiewicz and Brette, 2010&lt;/a&gt;). It also contains some unpublished work (in particular updates of the threshold equation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to extend this chapter with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few Brian notebooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A section on excitability types (Hodgkin classification).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some experimental confirmations of the threshold equation that are under way (you will see in section 4.4.2 that current published experimental data do not allow precise testing of the theory).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now planning to work on the chapter on action potential propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All comments are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer! Universities, community groups and even the NHS recommend it, citing benefits for society and also yourself. The claimed personal outcomes include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/volunteering/Pages/Whyvolunteer.aspx&quot;&gt;boosting your health and subjective wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, but while the former is slowly gathering experimental backing, the wellbeing research is overwhelmingly correlational, making it hard to prove that volunteering is causing the gains (it’s certainly plausible, for instance, that happier people are simply more inclined to give up their time for free). Now the journal &lt;i&gt;Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23743603.2016.1273647?journalCode=rrsp20&quot;&gt;a more robust test&lt;/a&gt;: a randomised study. The researchers looked for evidence to support the mental wellbeing benefits from volunteering … but they looked in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20855&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley Whillans of the University of British Columbia led the study which investigated the impact of a popular American volunteering programme called Community Service Learning (CSL), in which university students earn study credits by volunteering for ten to twelve hours per week – for example, running a food bank, or mentoring younger students. The university participating in this study was frequently oversubscribed for its CSL programme and used a lottery to place students into the programme or onto a wait list, naturally creating experimental and control groups similar in background and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants reported their mental wellbeing before and after the two-semester long programme ran, using a measure covering life satisfaction, personal meaning, experienced emotions and depressive symptoms, as well as feelings of loneliness and social connectedness. Volunteers have tended to show high scores on all of these measures in past research, so Whillans’ team predicted they would find a moderate increase in these outcomes among the volunteers in their study. But comparing the 232 volunteers to the 56 wait list students, no such effect was found. There wasn’t even any evidence that volunteering might be having a beneficial effect on a specific subgroup of the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results seem to suggest that volunteering does little or nothing for wellbeing. But if true, this really would be surprising, given that volunteering encompasses activities and experiences that are known to make humans happier. Giving to others &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5831/1622&quot;&gt;produces neural hedonic responses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;reducing isolation is crucial to wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, and opportunities to practice mastery and autonomy are key components of human flourishing. The CSL programme should be an especially good example of beneficial volunteering as course credit depends on students reflecting on their participation and developing learning plans, linking the volunteering to their own personal development. So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that volunteering can involve so many activities that it doesn’t make sense to try and investigate it as a whole. One volunteer might be offered autonomy and mastery of a new domain, another might end up in stifling conditions, and would have flourished more left to her own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the data hint at another explanation. The students investigated were, subjectively speaking, in a good place: only five per cent were at risk of depression, as compared to national student rates of closer to twenty per cent. All attended a good quality university that provides plenty of socialising, stimulation and opportunities for self-improvement. Without a deficit in these aspects of life, perhaps volunteering simply doesn’t have much additional to offer. This explanation is far from certain, but it does tally with &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/55/5/S308/536418/Differential-Benefits-of-Volunteering-Across-the&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that those who benefit most from volunteering tend to be people from more vulnerable backgrounds with fewer opportunities to enhance their sense of meaning or self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to conclude? That well-adjusted, privileged people should avoid volunteering? Not at all. For the most advantaged, volunteering, and charity more generally, can be seen as a duty to pay something back into society and help it run smoothly, which in the long run benefits us all. But we shouldn’t make false claims about the psychological benefits. The right kind of volunteering might be a glorious experience; at other times it might feel more like a drudgery, compared to the alternatives. Don’t do it expecting immediate gratification. Do it because it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>The past year has seen the emergence of a new field of neuroscience: neuroTrumpology. Also known as Trumphrenology, this discipline seeks to diagnose and explain the behaviour of Donald Trump and his supporters through reference to the brain.



Here are some examples of neuroTrump scholarship: Donald Trump's Lizard Brain (February 2016) and After a brain injury, I suddenly displayed some behavior similar to Donald Trump’s (August 2016). More recently we have Trump’s Lies vs. Your Brain</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably won’t be reaching for your violin too quickly but a series of new studies provide compelling evidence that beauty is a kind of “relationship liability”. While more physically attractive people have a clear advantage when it comes to finding partners, the results suggest that their relationships are more likely to breakdown, at least in part because they take greater interest in alternative partners, especially when dissatisfied in their current relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add further nuance to our understanding of how physical beauty impacts people’s lives. While good-looking folk seem to enjoy many advantages in life, on average, such as higher pay, more happiness and others assuming they are friendly and intelligent, it seems there are complicating factors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/08/11/it-doesnt-always-pay-to-be-pretty/&quot;&gt;jealousy is one&lt;/a&gt;, and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/pere.12173/abstract&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that less stability in their romantic relationships is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20725&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Ma-Kellams at Harvard University and her colleagues began by asking two women to judge the attractiveness of 238 men as pictured in their high school yearbooks aged 17 to 18. The researchers then accessed Ancestry.com to find the men’s marriage and divorce data for the 30 years since their high school photos were taken. The men who were rated as more facially attractive were more likely to be divorced and to have had marriages of shorter length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the researchers accessed the divorce and marriage data for the top 20 actors and actresses listed on IMDB.com and the world’s 100 most powerful celebrities according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; (removing duplicates resulted in a list of 130 celebs). The same female raters who judged the men’s attractiveness in the first study also rated the attractiveness of the celebrities. The more attractive celebrities were more likely to be divorced and they tended to be married for shorter lengths of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does being more attractive seem to go together with an increased chance of relationship breakup? Of course there could be many reasons, but Ma-Kellams and her team wanted to test one factor in particular: whether more attractive people are more interested in alternative partners. Relevant here is the established finding that once we are in a committed relationship most of us begin to show certain biases that help to sustain that relationship, including seeing other people as less attractive than we would do if we were single. The researchers tested whether attractive people lack this protective bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over one hundred and thirty participants, just under half of them currently in an exclusive romantic relationship, rated how attracted they were to a good-looking person of the opposite sex, as depicted in a photo. Meanwhile, the researchers discreetly assessed the participants’ own physical attractiveness. The results revealed an intriguing interaction between participants’ own attractiveness, their relationship status, and the ratings they gave to the person in the photo. More attractive participants tended to rate the person in the photo as more physically appealing than did the less attractive participants, but only if they (themselves) were already in a committed relationship. In other words, rather than having a bias to downplay the appeal of a potential alternative partner, attractive participants in a relationship actually seemed to show heightened interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study conducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website was similar but added a couple of twists: some participants were first made to feel attractive by looking at pictures of unattractive people before rating their own attractiveness; also participants in this study rated their satisfaction with their current relationship. All participants then went on to rate the physical appeal of several images of good-looking people of the opposite sex. The results showed that participants made to feel physically attractive tended to rate the good-looking people in the photos as more appealing, but only if they were currently in a relationship with which they were dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common sense suggests beautiful people are more likely to attract interest from would-be alternative partners. These new findings suggest that they are also more inclined than average to take an interest in them, especially if feeling discontented. This might help explain the pattern to emerge from the archival and celebrity data suggesting that being attractive tends to correlate with having shorter relationships and more divorces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s important not to over interpret these results: perhaps other factors related to physical attractiveness were the true cause of the apparent effects on relationship outcomes. That said, the researchers did factor out the influence of wealth in the celebrity data, and the data based on the college book photos was from two schools in very different areas, one working class, the other more privileged. Another caveat is that the survey research asked participants to rate the physical appeal of attractive people, but didn’t measure any actual cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When weighing up potential partners, we usually think of beauty as a definite plus point. But if you’ve recently been snubbed by a good-looker, console yourself this way: if you’d successfully hooked up with them, the chances are it wouldn’t have lasted anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Early antibody therapy can induce long-lasting immunity to SHIV</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/EHBaiG5NINA/nature21435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Highly potent and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) have been used to prevent and treat lentivirus infections in humanized mice, macaques, and humans. In immunotherapy experiments, administration of bNAbs to chronically infected animals transiently suppresses virus replication, which invariably returns to pre-treatment levels and results in progression to clinical disease. Here we show that early administration of bNAbs in a macaque simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model is associated with very low levels of persistent viraemia, which leads to the establishment of T-cell immunity and resultant long-term infection control. Animals challenged with SHIVAD8-EO by mucosal or intravenous routes received a single 2-week course of two potent passively transferred bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074 (refs 13, 14)). Viraemia remained undetectable for 56–177 days, depending on bNAb half-life in vivo. Moreover, in the 13 treated monkeys, plasma virus loads subsequently declined to undetectable levels in 6 controller macaques. Four additional animals maintained their counts of T cells carrying the CD4 antigen (CD4+) and very low levels of viraemia persisted for over 2 years. The frequency of cells carrying replication-competent virus was less than 1 per 106 circulating CD4+ T cells in the six controller macaques. Infusion of a T-cell-depleting anti-CD8β monoclonal antibody to the controller animals led to a specific decline in levels of CD8+ T cells and the rapid reappearance of plasma viraemia. In contrast, macaques treated for 15 weeks with combination anti-retroviral therapy, beginning on day 3 after infection, experienced sustained rebound plasma viraemia when treatment was interrupted. Our results show that passive immunotherapy during acute SHIV infection differs from combination anti-retroviral therapy in that it facilitates the emergence of potent CD8+ T-cell immunity able to durably suppress virus replication.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: 3D structures of individual mammalian genomes studied by single-cell Hi-C</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/plEZtiuxEMI/nature21429</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The folding of genomic DNA from the beads-on-a-string-like structure of nucleosomes into higher-order assemblies is crucially linked to nuclear processes. Here we calculate 3D structures of entire mammalian genomes using data from a new chromosome conformation capture procedure that allows us to first image and then process single cells. The technique enables genome folding to be examined at a scale of less than 100 kb, and chromosome structures to be validated. The structures of individual topological-associated domains and loops vary substantially from cell to cell. By contrast, A and B compartments, lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could drive chromosome and genome folding. By studying genes regulated by pluripotency factor and nucleosome remodelling deacetylase (NuRD), we illustrate how the determination of single-cell genome structure provides a new approach for investigating biological processes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Energy transduction and alternating access of the mammalian ABC transporter P-glycoprotein</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/9U2vlgp-f_M/nature21414</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the exporter class harness the energy of ATP hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to power the energetically uphill efflux of substrates by a dedicated transmembrane domain (TMD). Although numerous investigations have described the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and defined the architecture of ABC exporters, a detailed structural dynamic understanding of the transduction of ATP energy to the work of substrate translocation remains elusive. Here we used double electron–electron resonance and molecular dynamics simulations to describe the ATP- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of the mouse ABC efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; also known as ABCB1), which has a central role in the clearance of xenobiotics and in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Pairs of spin labels were introduced at residues selected to track the putative inward-facing to outward-facing transition. Our findings illuminate how ATP energy is harnessed in the NBDs in a two-stroke cycle and elucidate the consequent conformational motion that reconfigures the TMD, two critical aspects of Pgp transport mechanism. Along with a fully atomistic model of the outward-facing conformation in membranes, the insight into Pgp conformational dynamics harmonizes mechanistic and structural data into a novel perspective on ATP-coupled transport and reveals mechanistic divergence within the efflux class of ABC transporters.

This got me thinking about what we might call the ethics of citation.



Citation is a little-discussed subject in science. Certainly, there's plenty of talk about citations - about whether it is right to judge papers by the number of citations they receive, whet</content:encoded>
