	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Earth’s hot springs and hydrothermal vents are home to a previously unidentified group of archaea. And, unlike similar tiny, single-celled organisms that live deep in sediments and munch on decaying plant matter, these archaea don’t produce the climate-warming gas methane, researchers report April 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microorganisms are the most diverse and abundant form of life on Earth, and we just know 1 percent of them,” says Valerie De Anda, an environmental microbiologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Our information is biased toward the organisms that affect humans. But there are a lot of organisms that drive the main chemical cycles on Earth that we just don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Archaea are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbiologists-grow-microbe-tied-complex-life-origins&quot;&gt;a particularly mysterious group&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/14/20&lt;/em&gt;). It wasn’t until the late 1970s that they were recognized as a third domain of life, distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes (which include everything else, from fungi to animals to plants).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many years, archaea were thought to exist only in the most extreme environments on Earth, such as hot springs. But archaea are actually everywhere, and these microbes can play a big role in how carbon and nitrogen cycle between Earth’s land, oceans and atmosphere. One group of archaea, Thaumarchaeota, are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-ocean-these-bacteria-play-key-role-trapping-carbon&quot;&gt;most abundant microbes in the ocean&lt;/a&gt;, De Anda says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/28/17&lt;/em&gt;). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows&quot;&gt;methane-producing archaea in cows’ stomachs&lt;/a&gt; cause the animals to burp large amounts of the gas into the atmosphere (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/18/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Now, De Anda and her colleagues have identified an entirely new phylum — a large branch of related organisms on the tree of life — of archaea. The first evidence of these new organisms were within sediments from seven hot springs in China as well as from the deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. Within these sediments, the team found bits of DNA that it meticulously assembled into the genetic blueprints, or genomes, of 15 different archaea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the genetic information of the genomes with that of thousands of previously identified genomes of microbes described in publicly available databases. But “these sequences were completely different from anything that we know,” De Anda says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues gave the new group the name Brockarchaeota, for Thomas Brock, a microbiologist who was the first to grow archaea in the laboratory and who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/science/thomas-brock-dead.html&quot;&gt;died in April&lt;/a&gt;. Brock’s discovery paved the way for polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, a Nobel Prize–winning technique used to copy small bits of DNA, and currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states&quot;&gt;used in tests for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/6/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brockarchaeota, it turns out, actually live all over the world — but until now, they were overlooked, undescribed and unnamed. Once De Anda and her team had pieced together the new genomes and then hunted for them in public databases, they discovered that bits of these previously unknown organisms had been found in hot springs, geothermal and hydrothermal vent sediments from South Africa to Indonesia to Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DNA detective work&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sediments collected at hot springs in China and at the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California (in orange) contained bits of DNA that scientists found came from a previously undescribed group of organisms, dubbed Brockarchaeota, that also have a unique metabolism. After reconstructing the genetic blueprints of 15 different organisms from this group, the researchers found that fragments of DNA from all over the world (places marked in blue) that researchers had already uploaded to publicly available databases also turned out to belong to this group.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the new genomes, the team also hunted for genes related to the microbes’ metabolism — what nutrients they consume and what kind of waste they produce. Initially, the team expected that — like other archaea previously found in such environments — these archaea would be methane producers. They do munch on the same materials that methane-producing archaea do: one-carbon compounds like methanol or methylsulfide. “But we couldn’t identify the genes that produce methane,” De Anda says. “They are not present in Brockarchaeota.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that these archaea must have a previously undescribed metabolism, through which they can recycle carbon — for example in sediments on the seafloor — without producing methane. And, given how widespread they are, De Anda says, these organisms could be playing a previously hidden but significant role in Earth’s carbon cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s twofold interesting — it’s a new phylum and a new metabolism,” says Luke McKay, a microbial ecologist of extreme environments at Montana State University in Bozeman. The fact that this entire group could have remained under the radar for so long, he adds, “is an indication of where we are in the state of microbiology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, McKay adds, the discovery is also a testimonial to the power of metagenomics, the technique by which researchers can painstakingly tease apart individual genomes out of a large hodgepodge of microbes in a given sample of water or sediments. Thanks to this technique, researchers are identifying more and more parts of the previously mysterious microbial world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much out there,” De Anda says. And “every time you sequence more DNA, you start to realize that there’s more out there that you weren’t able to see the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/06/humans-arent-the-only-animals-to-experience-jealousy-dogs-do-too/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is a fairly common human emotion — and for a long time, it was presumed it truly was only human. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781444323542.ch2&quot;&gt;have argued&lt;/a&gt; that jealousy, with its focus on social threat, requires a concept of “self” and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/27/a-promising-study-suggests-teachers-can-train-8-year-olds-in-theory-of-mind/&quot;&gt;theory of mind&lt;/a&gt; — being jealous of someone flirting with your partner, for example, requires a level of threat (real or imagined) to your relationship. This element of jealousy has been used to argue that animals, without such a sense of self, are therefore unable to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620979149&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, suggests this might not be the case. Amalia P. M. Bastos and team from the University of Auckland find evidence that dogs may, in fact, be able to mentally represent the threatening social interactions that give rise to jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42024&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some previous research has already suggested that dogs get jealous — one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27251-1&quot;&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that dogs would move in between or push owners away from interactions with fake dogs. But that research didn’t provide conclusive evidence that the dogs were actually experiencing jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team recruited 18 dogs and their owners: all dogs had been in the household for at least six months, were non-aggressive and showed no signs of discomfort within the experimental setting, removing the possibility that they would move towards a fake dog out of aggression or fear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner sat behind a large barrier, wearing a blindfold and noise-cancelling headphones. The dogs were placed around five metres away, tied to a door frame attached to a force gauge in order to measure how hard they pulled on their leash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the fake dog condition, a realistic-looking fake dog was placed next to the owner behind the barrier. The barrier was then moved across the room for five seconds in order to reveal the fake dog to the real dog. When the barrier was moved back, blocking the view of the fake dog, the owner was instructed to pet and talk to it as if it were real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the cylinder condition, on the other hand, owners were shown petting and talking to a fleece cylinder behind the barrier. The realistic looking fake dog was still in the room, however, placed behind a separate, smaller barrier and revealed to the real dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dogs in the fake dog condition pulled significantly harder on their leashes than those in the fleece cylinder condition, suggesting that the dogs were attempting to break up the interaction between their owner and a perceived rival. The fact that the fake dog was present during the cylinder trials is important, showing that the mere &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of a rival wasn’t enough to invoke jealous behaviours: it was the actual interaction with the dog’s owner that led to increased jealous behaviour. When the dogs were later allowed to reach the fake dog, the team also found that the dogs engaged in genital and face sniffing  —  suggesting that they believed the fake dogs were real throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the dogs seemed to show “signatures” of jealous behaviour similar to those in humans: they reacted to a social partner engaging with a social rival (the fake dog) but not another object (the fleece cylinder), and didn’t react when the rival was in the room but not engaging with their owner. And most strikingly, they reacted strongly even though they couldn’t directly see the interaction between the owner and rival. Together, this suggests that dogs do indeed experience some form of jealousy, and can even mentally represent the social interactions that give rise to jealous feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This insight is important for several reasons, not only confirming previous research on jealousy in dogs but suggesting that dogs may have more complex cognitive abilities than we might assume. This may indicate the ability to conjure other mental representations in different situations  —  and a much richer inner life than we currently understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620979149&quot;&gt;Dogs Mentally Represent Jealousy-Inducing Social Interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Saturn has a fuzzy core, spread over more than half the planet’s diameter</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-planet-core-fuzzy-ring-astronomy-space</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of Saturn’s rings has revealed properties of its core, hidden deep beneath the planet’s golden atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That core isn’t the lump of rock and ice that many scientists had envisioned, the new study finds. Instead, the core is diffuse, pervaded by huge amounts of hydrogen and helium and so spread out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13385&quot;&gt;it spans 70,000 kilometers&lt;/a&gt;, or about 60 percent of the planet’s diameter, researchers report April 28 at arXiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new intel should help planetary scientists better understand not only how giant planets formed in our solar system but also the nature of such worlds orbiting other stars.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To ascertain the structure of Saturn’s core, astronomer Christopher Mankovich and astrophysicist Jim Fuller, both at Caltech, examined the giant planet’s rings. Just as earthquakes help seismologists probe Earth’s interior, oscillations inside Saturn can reveal its internal composition. These oscillations alter Saturn’s gravitational forces, inducing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ring-ripples-reveal-how-long-day-lasts-saturn&quot;&gt;waves in the rings&lt;/a&gt; —especially the C ring, which is the nearest of the three main rings to the planet (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/22/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;By analyzing a wave in that ring, along with data on Saturn’s gravity field from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rip-cassini-saturn-nasa&quot;&gt;now-defunct Cassini spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/15/17&lt;/em&gt;), Mankovich and Fuller found that the core has about 17 Earth masses of rock and ice. But there’s so much hydrogen and helium mixed in, the core encompasses 55 Earth masses altogether — more than half of Saturn’s total, which is equivalent to the mass of 95 Earths. This “ring seismology” work will appear in a future &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a new way to look at gas giant planets in the solar system,” says Ravit Helled, a planetary scientist at the University of Zurich who was not involved with the work. “This knowledge is important because it reflects on our understanding of giant exoplanets,” and indicates that giant planets in other solar systems probably have more complex structures than many researchers had thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery also illuminates how Saturn formed, says Nadine Nettelmann, a planetary scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Older theories posited that a gas giant such as Saturn arises when rock and ice orbiting the sun start to conglomerate. Tenuous gaseous envelopes let additional solid materials sink to the center, forming a compact core. Only later, according to this theory, does the core attract lots of hydrogen and helium — the ingredients that make up most of the planet. Although these elements are gases on Earth, Saturn’s great gravity squeezes most of them into a fluid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But newer theories say instead that plenty of gas got incorporated into the core of rock and ice when it was taking shape 4.6 billion years ago. As the planet accreted additional mass, the proportion of gas rose. The structure Mankovich and Fuller deduce for Saturn’s core preserves this formation history, Nettelmann says, because the planet’s very center, representing the oldest part of Saturn, has the greatest proportion of rock and ice. The fraction of rock and ice decrease gradually rather than abruptly from the core’s center to its edge, reflecting the core’s development over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I find the conclusions very important and very exciting and the line of reasoning very convincing,” Nettelmann says. Still, she cautions that additional waves in the rings should be analyzed for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The type of oscillation that Mankovich and Fuller detect inside Saturn also implies that the core is stable rather than bubbling like a pot of water on a hot stove, which is one way a planet can carry heat from its hot interior outward. The core’s stability may help explain a long-standing puzzle: why Saturn emits more energy than it gets from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the planet formed, it was warm with the heat of its birth, but then it cooled off. The core’s stability could have put a lid on some of this cooling, however, which helped the planet retain heat that it still radiates to this day. In contrast, if the core had instead transported heat via the upwelling and downwelling of material, the planet would have cooled off faster and no longer give off so much heat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: How to detect, resist and counter the flood of fake news</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;From lies about election fraud to QAnon conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine falsehoods, misinformation is racing through our democracy. And it is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awash in bad information, people have swallowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment&quot;&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt; hoping the drug will protect them against COVID-19 — even with no evidence that it helps (&lt;em&gt;SN Online: 8/2/20&lt;/em&gt;). Others refuse to wear masks, contrary to the best public health advice available. In January, protestors disrupted a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles, blocking life-saving shots for hundreds of people. “COVID has opened everyone’s eyes to the dangers of health misinformation,” says cognitive scientist Briony Swire-Thompson of Northeastern University in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has made clear that bad information can kill. And scientists are struggling to stem the tide of misinformation that threatens to drown society. The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-12/topline_npr_misinformation_poll_123020.pdf&quot;&gt;83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information&lt;/a&gt;. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information — and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what they’re looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;anti-vaccine protestors outside of Dodger stadium&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099272&quot; height=&quot;656&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/050821_AW_misinfo_inline-1_1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099272&quot;&gt;In January, protests closed down a mass vaccination site at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099272&quot;&gt;Irfan Khan/&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Wow factor&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with “troll farms” in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3099185&amp;amp;preview=true&quot;&gt;unwittingly share misinformation&lt;/a&gt; on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented — whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. “Seeing is believing,” Sundar says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video sells&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic — in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a screencap of what WhatsApp users saw&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099273&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/050821_AW_misinfo_inline-2_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099273&quot;&gt;S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, in press at the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication&lt;/em&gt;, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. “People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form,” Sundar says. That’s especially important with the rise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-program-generates-eerily-realistic-fake-videos&quot;&gt;deepfake technologies&lt;/a&gt; that feature false but visually convincing videos (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/15/18, p. 12&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once it’s there. We’re constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it,” she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/17/1912441117&quot;&gt;because of the influence of their emotions and values&lt;/a&gt;, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives — or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One such approach is to “prebunk” beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gch2.201600008&quot;&gt;canceled any benefit of receiving the true information&lt;/a&gt;. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined people’s understanding of what was true.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that “Charles Darwin” and “members of the Spice Girls” were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getbadnews.com/#intro&quot;&gt;Bad News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goviralgame.com/en&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;GO VIRAL!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Take a breath&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it doesn’t take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what they’re doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as “Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling,” with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants’ analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771830163X&quot;&gt;lazy thinking rather than political bias&lt;/a&gt; may drive people’s susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into people’s behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/zhjkp/&quot;&gt;political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm people’s reasoning skills&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to “nudge” the concept of accuracy into people’s minds, helping them resist misinformation. “It’s basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form,” he says. “We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push in the right direction&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099270&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/050821_AW_misinfo_inline-4_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099270&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Source: G. Pennycook &lt;i&gt;et al/Nature&lt;/i&gt; 2021&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation — Breitbart and InfoWars — Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. It’s a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges — but the work, reported online March 17 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03344-2&quot;&gt;very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as “true” or “false” after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to debunk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if you’re fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or you’re more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobilize when you see misinformation being shared on social media as soon as possible. If you see something, say something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;The Debunking Handbook 2020&lt;/i&gt;; News Literacy Project&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2020043118&quot;&gt;after someone reads a headline can be helpful&lt;/a&gt;, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-moderation-birdwatch-focus-idUSKBN2BB13A&quot;&gt;run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging&lt;/a&gt;. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misinformation researchers have recently called for &lt;a href=&quot;https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/tackling-misinformation-what-researchers-could-do-with-social-media-data/&quot;&gt;social media companies to share more of their data&lt;/a&gt; so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users’ privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the work to date on misinformation’s spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately,” van der Linden says, “we’re trying to answer the question: What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to have herd immunity against misinformation?”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Some viruses thwart bacterial defenses with a unique genetic alphabet</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/virus-dna-z-bacteriophage-genetic-alphabet-bond-life</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some bacteria-killing viruses spell out their genetic instructions in a different DNA alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 40 years ago, scientists in Russia reported that a type of bacteriophage called cyanophage S-2L replaces the DNA building block adenine, commonly known as A, with 2-aminoadenine, designated Z. But no one knew how the phage went from A to Z, or why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After decades of wondering, two independent groups of scientists have discovered how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6541/516&quot;&gt;viruses make&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6541/520&quot;&gt;build Z into their genetic instructions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6541/512&quot;&gt;one reason they do it&lt;/a&gt;, the teams report in three studies in the April 30 &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings have implications for the origins of life on Earth, the search for life on other planets and &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6541/460&quot;&gt;multiple potential applications&lt;/a&gt; in biomedicine, synthetic biology, material sciences and computing, says Farren Isaacs, a molecular and synthetic biologist at Yale University who coauthored a commentary in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s a really fundamental discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Philippe Marlière, a xenobiologist then at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was “looking for examples divergent from life as we know it,” when he came across the 1977 Russian study describing the cyanophage with the unusual DNA. After getting a sample of the virus, Marlière and colleagues deciphered the phage’s complete set of genetic instructions, or genome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the virus’s genome, the researchers found instructions for building an enzyme, called PurZ, that could carry out the first step in making Z — also known as diaminopurine. The Pasteur Institute filed a patent on the enzyme in Marlière’s name in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the enzyme in hand, “it became crystal clear how Z was made, but we didn’t [do] any experiments to prove that we were right,” says Marlière, now president of the European Syndicate of Synthetic Scientists and Industrialists in Berlin. The project was halted for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t publish their findings until now, in part, because PurZ wasn’t the enzyme Marlière was looking for. Instead, he says he had hoped to find a different enzyme, a polymerase that would reject adenine and instead build DNA with Z in its place. “I was very, very disappointed,” he says, “because the polymerase I was craving could not be detected in that phage.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this phage’s polymerase isn’t what he was looking for. Marlière’s collaborator Pierre Alexandre Kaminski and colleagues found that cyanophage S-2L’s polymerase isn’t picky about using A or Z. Instead, another viral &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22626-x&quot;&gt;enzyme called DatZ degrades adenine building blocks&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the polymerase no choice but to use Z, Kaminski, a biochemist at the Pasteur Institute, and colleagues report April 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Periodically, Marlière searched genetic databases for other phages that have PurZ and might contain the elusive picky polymerase. Then about four years ago, he says, “I got results. Ding, ding, ding! And I didn’t get just one. I got 12. And bingo, right next door to this PurZ gene was, guess what, a polymerase gene. Aha!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/em&gt; bacteriophages that infect a wide variety of bacteria all have versions of the polymerase, called DpoZ, that preferentially insert Z instead of A into the viruses’ DNA, the researchers report. Marlière has filed a patent on the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How DNA’s Z–T bond differs from the more standard A–T bond&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;diagram of DNA base adenine bonding to thymine&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099464&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/042921_ti_zdna_inline_adenine-thymine.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099464&quot;&gt;D. Czernecki &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; 2021; C. Chang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The standard DNA base adenine, known as A (left), links up with its partner thymine, known as T (right), via two hydrogen bonds (orange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram of DNA base 2-aminoadenine bonding to thymine&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099461&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/042921_ti_zdna_inline_2-aminoadenine-thymine.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099461&quot;&gt;D. Czernecki &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; 2021; C. Chang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The base 2-aminoadenine, also called Z (left), has one more amino group (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, red) than adenine. That addition allows Z to form an extra hydrogen bond (orange) with thymine, which makes the Z-T pairing more stable than A-T pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alternative alphabet may be used far more widely than previously thought, says Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He first heard about the bacteriophage that use Z-containing DNA at a dinner party a few years ago, he recalls. Not knowing that the French scientists were still working on the puzzle, he also searched databases and found 60 bacteriophages that contain PurZ, including phages from both the &lt;em&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Podoviridae&lt;/em&gt; families. His team also worked out the biochemical pathway the phages use to make and incorporate Z, and found enzymes that degrade A.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just because the phages have the enzymes, they don’t necessarily use Z in their DNA. So Zhao and colleagues in China chose a phage called SH-Ab 15497 that infects &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, and confirmed that its DNA alphabet also has Z in place of A, his team reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Replacing As with Zs&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why phages would bother with the unconventional DNA was still unknown. One hypothesis is that replacing A with Z is a countermeasure against bacterial defense enzymes, known as restriction enzymes, that chop up DNA from invading phages. Such enzymes have a hard time recognizing and cutting DNA containing Z bases, Zhao and colleagues found. “The phage is trying to avoid being destroyed by the host,” he says. “This is really a protection mechanism for the phage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also part of a never-ending arms race between phages and bacteria, says Steven Benner, a chemist and astrobiologist at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Alachua, Fla. It’s possible that other phages that use Z or other alternative DNA bases may still be out there. “We have overlooked this life-form on Earth because our molecular tools didn’t allow us to look for it,” he says. “What these guys have done is discover an entire biosphere that was missing from our inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s debatable whether Z-containing phages are new forms of life (not to mention the ongoing debate about whether viruses are alive), says Floyd Romesberg, a synthetic biologist at the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Sanofi’s site in La Jolla, Calif. But it does open up new possibilities, he says, for what life is, was, and could become.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Life isn’t exactly what we thought it was. Life doesn’t have to be GTAC,” he says, referring to the four letters of the standard DNA alphabet. “What it says is that life can be more diverse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That realization could influence the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/will-we-know-extraterrestrial-life-when-we-see-it&quot;&gt;search for life on other planets&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/18/16&lt;/em&gt;). Scientists often assume that they should search for guanine, thymine, adenine and cytosine, the bases of DNA as we’ve known it until now. But maybe researchers should be looking for 2-aminoadenine, the Z base, instead, Benner says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, Z forms three hydrogen bonds with thymine, instead of the two hydrogen bonds that hold A–T base pairs together. That makes Z–T paired DNA more stable and potentially able to stand up to hotter or harsher conditions than conventional DNA can, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bacteriophage SH-Ab 15497&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099462&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/042921_ti_zdna_inline_3_desktop_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099462&quot;&gt;Bacteriophage SH-Ab 15497 (shown in this electron micrograph), which infects &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;, replaces A with Z in its genome.

Hua &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bacteriophage SH-Ab 15497&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099463&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/042921_ti_zdna_inline_3_mobile_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099463&quot;&gt;Bacteriophage SH-Ab 15497 (shown in this electron micrograph), which infects &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;, replaces A with Z in its genome.

Hua &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the extra stability, one might wonder why all organisms on Earth don’t use Z. Stability isn’t everything, Romesberg says. DNA has to be unwound and split apart to be copied. That may be harder to do with Z–T base pairs. Z also changes how DNA curves and bends, perhaps making it harder to pack into tight spaces the way A-containing genetic material can. That might make A more attractive for other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps it was just an accident that A came first. Once cells started using that base, too many things would have to change to completely switch to another base, says Romesberg, who has been working for years to get bacteria to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/organism-artificial-dna-alphabet-makes-its-debut&quot;&gt;incorporate exotic DNA bases&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/7/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cells have a hard time swapping because there are so many different parts that would have to be changed to accommodate a new DNA base. Viruses’ stripped-down genomes are more flexible, Romesberg says: They carry around less machinery because they make the host do most of the work. Even the Z-phage do just the first step in making Z and rely on several host enzymes to finish the recipe. It’s still not known whether cellular organisms can write Z into their DNA, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: A child’s 78,000-year-old grave marks Africa’s oldest known human burial</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-oldest-known-human-burial-child-grave-cave</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A child whose lifeless body was carefully placed in an East African cave around 78,300 years ago has made a grand return.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers who unearthed the ancient youngster’s remains say that they’ve found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03457-8&quot;&gt;oldest known intentional human burial in Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The investigators, who report the discovery in the May 6 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, have named the ancient youngster Mtoto, a Swahili word that means “child.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mtoto was buried in a sheltered part of a cave that was repeatedly occupied by people over a span of nearly 80,000 years, up to about 500 years ago,” said archaeologist Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, at a May 3 news conference. Local people still visit this spot to worship and conduct rituals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mtoto’s discovery suggests that “a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00805-6&quot;&gt;tradition of symbolically significant burials&lt;/a&gt;, at least for the very young, might have been culturally embedded in parts of Africa” toward the end of the Middle Stone Age, which ran from around 320,000 to 30,000 years ago, writes bioarchaeologist Louise Humphrey of the National History Museum in London in a comment published with the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Excavations at Panga ya Saidi, or PYS, a cave site located in forested hills about 15 kilometers from Kenya’s coast, revealed Mtoto’s grave. Petraglia and Max Planck archaeologist Nicole Boivin led work there starting in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preliminary signs of Mtoto’s burial appeared in 2013. Digging revealed part of a shallow pit, but fragmentary bones visible in the pit were too fragile to remove or study closely. Stone tools typical of Africa’s Middle Stone Age had turned up in the same sediment, giving researchers a sense of how old the bones were. Lab analyses indicated that the sediment had last been exposed to sunlight about 78,300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators excavated the entire pit in 2017 and covered it in plaster for transport to the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. There, researchers noticed that two teeth in the pit looked human.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Panga ya Saidi cave site&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099438&quot; height=&quot;454&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050421_bb_burial_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099438&quot;&gt;Excavations at this African cave site called Panga ya Saidi revealed the continent’s oldest known example of an intentional human burial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099438&quot;&gt;Mohammad Javad Shoaee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plastered pit was then sent to paleoanthropologist María Martinón-Torres at the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain. After removing plaster around the earthen block, her team used CT imaging to create digital versions of the PYS bones, revealing a &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; child’s partial skeleton. Fossil positions indicated that the child had been placed on his or her right side, with knees bent up toward the chest. Many bones were intact enough to be removed from the pit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The size and development of the two teeth in the pit indicated that the child had died at age 2.5 to 3 years. Microscopic study of the fossils and chemical analyses of pit sediment indicated that the child’s body was interred soon after death, before decomposition began. That explains why parts of the child’s skeleton remain well-preserved, including a skull base connected to three neck bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Special care was taken in burying Mtoto, Martinón-Torres said. For instance, the skull base and attached neck bones had collapsed away from other back bones in a way suggesting that the child’s head originally lay on a support or pillow that had decayed. Rotation of a collarbone and two ribs suggested that Mtoto’s upper body had originally been wrapped in a shroud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841600004X&quot;&gt;An infant found in a pit inside southern Africa’s Border Cave in 1941&lt;/a&gt; has previously been cited as Africa’s earliest burial. But evidence for that argument remains uncertain, Petraglia said. The Border Cave infant dates to between 74,000 and 58,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s true Mtoto is the oldest burial in Africa, more Middle Stone Age burials have been found in Eurasia and the Middle East than in Africa. Humans were buried in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-code-red-scarlet-symbols-emerge-israeli-cave&quot;&gt;Israeli cave more than 90,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;10/29/03&lt;/em&gt;). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-cave-fossils-have-revived-debate-over-neandertal-burials&quot;&gt;Neandertals may have buried their dead&lt;/a&gt; in an Iraqi Kurdistan cave 60,000 to 70,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: 2/18/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mtoto and the possible Border Cave burial fit a Middle Stone Age pattern in Eurasia of regularly interring infants and children in public spots, says archaeologist João Zilhão of the University of Barcelona, who was not involved in the study. After around 30,000 years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/fossil-may-expose-humanitys-hybrid-roots&quot;&gt;Eurasian infants and children were buried in remote locations&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: 5/8/99&lt;/em&gt;), unlike teens and adults, he says. It’s not clear why age-related differences in the treatment of the dead occurred at that time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many Middle Stone Age Africans may have buried the dead of all ages away from living areas, not in caves where people continued to live, says archaeologist Lyn Wadley of University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who also was not involved in the study. If that’s the case, finding more African burials from Mtoto’s time will most likely be a challenge. “Open-air burials are not easy to find and preservation is likely to be poor,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Mindfulness Can Make Independent-Minded People Less Likely To Help Others</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/05/mindfulness-can-make-independent-minded-people-less-likely-to-help-others/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness — in basic terms, the practice of being “present” in the moment and paying attention to one’s own thoughts and feelings — has seen something of a boom over the last few years. In the United States, the mindfulness business is set to reach a value of $2 billion by next year, while in the United Kingdom, lockdown &lt;a href=&quot;https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/mindfulness-apps-coronavirus-lockdown-explained-chilled-headspace-448667&quot;&gt;saw a spike in downloads for digital meditation offerings&lt;/a&gt; such as Headspace and Calm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is mindfulness all it’s cracked up to be? While it certainly has its benefits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality&quot;&gt;some argue&lt;/a&gt; that it encourages blind acceptance of the status quo, taking us so far into ourselves that we forget the rest of the world. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/xhyua/&quot;&gt;a new preprint&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Poulin and colleagues from New York’s University at Buffalo also find that mindfulness can decrease prosocial behaviours — at least for those who see themselves as independent from others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42014&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study was designed to look at the impact of mindfulness on prosocial activity, and in particular whether this depends on a person’s “self-construal”. In short, if someone has an independent self-construal they see the self as separate from others, rather than thinking more collectively and conceptualising themselves as part of a wider group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, one oriented around mindfulness meditation, and the other focusing on a control meditation in the form of mind wandering. Those in the mindfulness condition listened to a tape designed to induce mindfulness through mindful breathing, while those in the mind wandering condition were instructed to “let your mind wander and think freely without needing to focus hard on anything in particular”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After listening to the tapes, participants read about a local poverty and homelessness charity, before being asked whether or not they wanted to stuff envelopes in support of the organisation. Participants who decided to take part were left to do so for as long as they wanted. The team also measured participants’ self-construal by asking them to indicate how much they identified with friends, family, and wider groups compared to how much they thought of themselves as independent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most participants (84%) stuffed at least some envelopes after the task, though the number varied significantly  —  some stuffed up to 158, while others did just one. People who participated in the mindfulness meditation stuffed 15% more envelopes than those who did the control mediation — if they had an interdependent self-construal. But for those with independent self-construals, mindfulness &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; the number of envelopes stuffed by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated the first: this time, however, the team attempted to manipulate participants’ self-construal. Participants were asked to go through a paragraph selecting all of the pronouns. In the independent condition, participants selected singular pronouns (“&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; went to the city”) and in the interdependent condition, they selected plural pronouns (“&lt;em&gt;we &lt;/em&gt;went to the city”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the second study took place online, participants were not asked to stuff envelopes, but instead to sign up (or not) for time slots to chat online with alumni donors to request financial support for the same charity. And similar to the results of the first study, those primed with independent self-construal were less likely to volunteer after listening to the mindfulness exercise, while those in the interdependent condition saw an increased likelihood of volunteering after the mindfulness task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other research has found similar results; one 2017 study, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/17/mindfulness-training-does-not-foster-empathy-and-can-even-make-narcissists-worse/&quot;&gt;found that mindfulness did not have the empathy-boosting benefits&lt;/a&gt; that many of its adherents had claimed, at least in those high in narcissistic traits. This latter finding seems key: as in this study, it may not be that mindfulness decreases empathy or prosocial behaviours across the board, but only in combination with particular personality types. After all, interdependent participants saw an &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in prosocial behaviours, not a decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing a more nuanced view of the benefits of mindfulness, then, might be one way of dealing with this issue. Following its meteoric rise, mindfulness has often been positioned as a panacea, not only for anxiety or other mental health conditions but in other areas, too: productivity, creativity, personal relationships, and particular traits or habits. Rather than treating it as a wholesale good, however, it may be better to understand when mindfulness might be truly beneficial — and, importantly, for whom. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/xhyua/&quot;&gt;Minding your own business? Mindfulness decreases prosocial behavior for those with independent self-construals&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint, meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435&quot;&gt;Satoru Joshita and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791&quot;&gt;John Cole and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_6092e00c8ebdc&quot;&gt;

                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols&quot;&gt;Submission Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. This unique article type was developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A rare glimpse of a star before it went supernova defies expectations</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-glimpse-star-before-went-supernova-defies-expectations</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A rare glimpse of a star before it exploded in a fiery supernova looks nothing like astronomers expected, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that a relatively cool, puffy star ended its life in a hydrogen-free supernova. Until now, supernovas without hydrogen were thought to originate only from extremely hot, compact stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery “is a very important test case for stellar evolution,” says Sung-Chul Yoon, an astrophysicist at Seoul National University in South Korea, who was not involved in the work. Theorists have some ideas about how massive stars behave right before they blow up, but such hefty stars are scant in the local universe and many are nowhere near ready to go supernova, Yoon says. Retroactively identifying the star responsible for a supernova provides an opportunity to test scenarios of how stars evolve right before exploding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding those stars, however, is difficult, explains Charlie Kilpatrick, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. A telescope must have looked at that exact region of the sky in the years leading up to the supernova. And the explosion must have happened close enough for light from its much fainter source star to have reached a telescope.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Although both conditions are tricky to meet, Kilpatrick is undaunted by the hunt. After scientists discovered a supernova in December 2019, in a galaxy called NGC 4666 about 46 million light-years away, he and colleagues rushed to check old Hubble observations from the same region of the sky. They wanted to find the star behind the explosion, dubbed SN 2019yvr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After pouring over images and cross-checking observations with those from ground-based telescopes, the team found their quarry: a star at the same spot as the supernova, observed about 2.6 years before the explosion. It appeared to be a yellow star about 6,500° Celsius and about 320 times wider than the sun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was kind of puzzled by all that,” Kilpatrick says. The supernova SN 2019yvr lacked hydrogen, so its progenitor was expected to be hydrogen-deficient, too. But “if a star lacks a hydrogen envelope, then you expect to be seeing deeper inside of the star to the hotter layers,” Kilpatrick says. That is, the star should have looked extremely hot and blue and compact — maybe 10,0000 to 50,000° C, and no more than 50 times wider than the sun. The cool, large, yellow progenitor of SN 2019yvr, on the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab838&quot;&gt;appeared to be padded with lots of hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers report the results May 5 in the &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this kind of star to have produced a supernova like SN 2019yvr, it must have shed much of its hydrogen before blowing up, Kilpatrick says. But how?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and colleagues have come up with a couple scenarios. The star could have expelled much of its hydrogen into space through violent eruptions, possibly caused by some instability in the star’s core or interference from another star nearby. Or perhaps the star’s hydrogen could have been stripped off by another star that was in orbit around it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To whittle these possibilities down, Jan Eldridge, an astrophysicist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, suggests turning the Hubble telescope back on that area of the sky. Astronomers should first make sure that the star seen 2.6 years before SN 2019yvr really is gone now, says Eldridge, who was not involved in the work. Researchers could also check whether a star that once orbited SN 2019yvr’s progenitor still remains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve found a mystery, and they’ve got some solutions,” Eldridge notes. Trying to figure out how such an unlikely star pulled off this particular supernova, she says, “is going to be fun.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: How a small city in Brazil may reveal how fast vaccines can curb COVID-19</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-serrana-brazil-covid-mass-vaccine</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The city of Serrana in Brazil is a living experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The picturesque place, surrounded by sugarcane fields, is nestled in the southeast of one of the countries hit hardest by COVID-19. By the end of March, daily deaths in Brazil surged to 3,000 on average a day, a high in a pandemic that has claimed more than 405,000 lives there — the second worst death toll of any country in the world behind only the United States. And as vaccines slowly trickle into the country, only about 15 percent of the population has gotten at least one shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Except in Serrana. There, nearly all the adults have gotten their shots. What happens next in this city could provide a glimpse of what the future of the pandemic could be — not only in Brazil but across the globe as vaccinations pick up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04747821&quot;&gt;mass vaccination is an experiment&lt;/a&gt; dubbed Projeto S, which will measure the real-world effectiveness of the Chinese-made CoronaVac vaccine, including how well it protects against coronavirus variants. One variant called P.1, which first emerged in the Brazilian Amazon and is now widespread throughout Brazil, shows signs of being both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-p1-variant-brazil-strain-transmission-immunity&quot;&gt;more contagious and able to evade antibodies&lt;/a&gt; trained to recognize the coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/14/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Among the questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://especiais.g1.globo.com/bemestar/vacina/2021/mapa-brasil-vacina-covid/&quot;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; may help answer is “whether vaccinated people protect the unvaccinated, how long does their immunity last, and what variants are circulating,” says Marcos Borges, project coordinator and director of the Serrana State Hospital. “We’ll finally be able to observe how a large set of people respond to the vaccine in real-world conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Projeto S may be the best way to understand the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 in the short and medium terms, says Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Espírito Santo. “This is especially important because we don’t know when we will have most Brazilians vaccinated,” says Maciel, who is not involved in the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;aerial image of Serrana, Brazil&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099411&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050321_MR_covid-brazil_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099411&quot;&gt;This aerial image shows Serrana, a town of 45,600 people at the north of São Paulo state, where researchers are conducting Projeto S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099411&quot;&gt;Andre Penner/AP Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Setting up the project&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Serrana has the perfect ingredients for the Projeto S experiment. It’s relatively small, with 45,600 residents, with roughly 30,000 adults. It’s located near an important public health research center, University of São Paulo’s campus in nearby Ribeirão Preto. And the virus was clearly circulating in the community. A July 2020 study “showed that 5 percent of the population carried the active virus — that is one person in 20, a very high rate,” Borges says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The town’s residents were eager to be vaccinated, however. When the project launched in February, the team at Instituto Butantan, a research facility and vaccine maker based in São Paulo state that is sponsoring the project, set a goal of vaccinating at least 80 percent of town residents over 18 years old. “We took into account that Brazil has a long tradition of good adhesion to vaccination, so we knew these 80 percent were within reach,” says Borges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By April 11, 27,722 adult volunteers had gotten the first shot and almost all of them, 27,160, had gotten the second jab by the end of that month, meaning 95.7 percent of Serrana’s adults were fully vaccinated. This success came even as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/noticias-coronavirus/projeto-s-imuniza-27-mil-pessoas-98-da-populacao-alvo-de-serrana/&quot;&gt;Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro publicly shunned vaccines&lt;/a&gt; — CoronaVac in particular — on several occasions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was developed by China-based Sinovac Biotech. It uses an inactivated, or “killed” version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that can’t cause illness, but can train the body’s immune system to recognize the coronavirus so it can fight back against an encounter with the real pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.12.21255308v1&quot;&gt;Phase III clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; with 12,600 health care workers in São Paulo,  CoronaVac had an efficacy of roughly 50 percent two weeks after the second dose, researchers report in a preliminary study posted April 15 at medRxiv.org.  Fifty percent efficacy is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results&quot;&gt;threshold the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set as a baseline&lt;/a&gt; for considering emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. In comparison, in clinical trials, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results&quot;&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results&quot;&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; mRNA vaccines had an efficacy of around 95 percent (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/16/20; SN: 11/18/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;volunteer being screened for Projeto S&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099412&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050321_MR_covid-brazil_inline-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099412&quot;&gt;Volunteers go through a screening process before enrolling in Projeto S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099412&quot;&gt;Divulgação/Instituto Butantan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, CoronaVac offers good protection against death and serious forms of COVID-19; of nine health care workers hospitalized with COVID-19, six were unvaccinated, one had had a single dose of CoronaVac and two had gotten both doses. One person —an unvaccinated health care worker — died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Real-world data&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial is one thing. The real world is another. For instance, having immunized neighbors might make an important difference in how effective a vaccine actually is. “What is the difference between a vaccine that has 95 percent of individual efficacy and one that has over 50 percent? You’ve got to vaccinate 80 or 85 percent of people with the former to have the disease under control and must vaccinate everyone with the latter to have the same result,” says Ernesto Marques, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As most adults have been vaccinated in Serrana, Marques says he believes the results will show collective protection — or effectiveness — with CoronaVac, even if individual protection seems low comparatively. This is important not only to Brazil, “but to all countries adopting the vaccine, like Indonesia and Turkey. The results in Serrana will weigh immensely in COVID-19 vaccination policies wherever CoronaVac is used,” he says. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vaccine-covid-denman-bc-1.6009513&quot;&gt;Communities in other countries&lt;/a&gt; are attempting something similar with other vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outcomes may show whether the impact of Serrana’s mass vaccination spills beyond city limits. “Around 15,000 of Serrana’s 45,000 inhabitants commute large distances to work, so we’ll see how it all unfolds with a highly mobile population,” Borges says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Projeto S is yielding some tantalizing early results. Local media &lt;a href=&quot;https://g1.globo.com/sp/ribeirao-preto-franca/noticia/2021/04/23/vacinacao-em-massa-media-movel-de-casos-da-covid-19-se-mantem-em-queda-ha-1-mes-em-serrana-sp.ghtml&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the number of daily COVID-related infections decreased from 28 on March 20 to seven a month later. The share of cases that were severe dropped from a peak of &lt;a href=&quot;https://g1.globo.com/sp/ribeirao-preto-franca/noticia/2021/04/06/vacinacao-em-massa-serrana-sp-ve-sinais-de-queda-em-casos-graves-da-covid-19-e-na-busca-por-atendimentos.ghtml&quot;&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; this March to 10 percent in early April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;person getting CoronaVac vaccine&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099413&quot; height=&quot;454&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050321_MR_covid-brazil_inline-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099413&quot;&gt;A volunteer gets the second shot of CoronaVac at the Municipal School Jardim Dom Pedro I in Serrana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099413&quot;&gt;Divulgação/Instituto Butantan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the project’s vaccination from mid-February to mid-April, six immunized people died from COVID-19, according to the state government of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/noticias-coronavirus/projeto-s-imuniza-27-mil-pessoas-98-da-populacao-alvo-de-serrana/&quot;&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. Of those, five had received only one dose and the other person showed symptoms shortly after receiving the second dose, which leads researchers to believe the patient was already infected at the time of the second shot. Among the unvaccinated there were 14 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of May, none of the six infirmary beds at Serrana’s Santa Casa Hospital and the city’s Basic Healthcare Unit are occupied, and the waiting line for beds both in infirmaries and intensive care units has zeroed. As of May 3, there is one Serrana resident in an infirmary and nine patients in an ICU, according to the Serrana Health Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nurse Glenda de Moraes, who has worked for two decades in Serrana and is involved in the coordination of Projeto S, says that positive test results have dropped, too, “to less than 20 percent [per day], way less than the 30 to 40 percent of positives we had before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still according to the local Health Secretariat, confirmed cases peaked in January 2021, with 706 city residents infected with COVID-19. Infections then decreased in February and March (484 and 692 cases, respectively) and had a sharp drop in April, with 235 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of this is clearly “an effect from the vaccination,” Maciel says. But Borges is more cautious in relating all these changes to the mass immunization. “We are still studying it and when we have the results, we’ll be able to affirm for sure if these events are related,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Projeto S will continue following residents for a year. The questions that tracking can answer — for instance, how long does a vaccine provide protection — are crucial to helping Brazilians, and the rest of the world, find the path out of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Juliana Elaga, the first person to be vaccinated in Serrana, is sure this is the way out. “I suffered a lot with the pandemic, and the vaccination was a really emotional moment for me. I felt truly relieved after the second jab. Even still adopting social distancing and mask-wearing, my heart is more at rest.” Her 8-year-old, Petras, is a witness: “Mom used to wear two masks at once and rub her hands with alcohol-gel all the time. Now she seems a little more normal and not so worried all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Here’s what breakthrough infections reveal about COVID-19 vaccines</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As around 2 million people a day across the United States receive a dose of one of three COVID-19 vaccines, cases of the disease are once again on the decline thanks in part to rising immunity. But even as COVID-19 cases wane, researchers are scrutinizing ones popping up in a particular group of people: those who are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such cases, called breakthrough infections, aren’t unexpected. That’s because the vaccines are not 100 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people hear about breakthrough infections, they automatically think ‘oh, these vaccines are not working’ or ‘they’re not effective,’” says Richard Teran, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Epidemic Intelligence Service. “That is just not true … the majority of individuals who do get the vaccine are protected against COVID infection and also from severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three jabs currently authorized for use in the United States — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s — proved effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms in clinical trials. And evidence is building that Pfizer’s and Moderna’s jabs, both mRNA vaccines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease&quot;&gt;thwart infection as well&lt;/a&gt; in immunized people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/30/21&lt;/em&gt;). People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all doses of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when coronavirus breakthroughs do happen, there are several important questions for experts to consider, says Francesca Torriani, an infectious diseases physician and hospital epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do the breakthrough infections cause severe disease? Or do vaccinated people tend to have milder symptoms? Another question is whether immunized people who still get infected pass the virus on to others. Lastly, did an immunized person get the infection because their immune system didn’t kick into high gear after getting the shot? Or was it that the vaccine sparked an immune response that didn’t offer much protection against, perhaps, a coronavirus variant?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been some progress toward answering these questions since COVID-19 vaccines began making it into arms in late 2020. Here’s what researchers have learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Rare breakthroughs&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 95 million people in the United States who were fully vaccinated, only 9,245 — or 0.01 percent — have been infected with the coronavirus as of April 26, according to the CDC. Just over a quarter of those people never had symptoms; 132 people, or 1 percent of the breakthrough infections, died. Twenty of those deaths were in asymptomatic people or probably not related to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies analyzing vaccinated people in the real world show that not only are breakthrough COVID-19 cases rare (at least based on analyses of the mRNA vaccines; there has been less time to study J&amp;amp;J’s shot), they also lessen the chances of severe disease. What’s more, there are hints that vaccinated people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pfizer-vaccine-may-reduce-transmission&quot;&gt;less likely to transmit the virus&lt;/a&gt; to others (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, for example, vaccinations helped stem the coronavirus’ spread in skilled nursing facilities — which were hit hard earlier in the pandemic because of high risk of exposure and residents at risk of becoming severely ill. Among 14,765 fully vaccinated residents and staff members, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e1.htm&quot;&gt;22 people got the virus more than two weeks after their second dose&lt;/a&gt; of Moderna’s jab, Teran and colleagues reported in the April 30 &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of those 22 people were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, but two were hospitalized for COVID-19. One person, who had multiple underlying conditions, died. But there weren’t any additional cases traced back to the breakthrough infections, suggesting that the risk of transmission from infected vaccinated people is low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to get a better handle on transmission risk from vaccinated people and whether older people with underlying conditions might be more likely to have a breakthrough infection. But “I think [the study] really shows that the vaccines are working,” Teran says. And the shots are “our most important tool for stopping COVID transmission and finally slowing down this pandemic here in the U.S.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key to finding breakthrough infections is doing a lot of testing, says Torriani, who coauthored a March 23 &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; letter that described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101927&quot;&gt;success of mRNA vaccines at protecting health care workers in Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. An infected person might not have symptoms or only mild ones, meaning cases could easily fly under the radar or be mistaken for things like the common cold. So current CDC counts are likely an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vaccines and variants&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the ongoing pandemic that experts are meticulously watching is the emergence of coronavirus variants. Some mutations in the coronavirus could help it evade immune responses in vaccinated people, who could require a booster shot to provide better protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Israel, for instance, people vaccinated with Pfizer’s shot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254882v1&quot;&gt;may be more likely to be infected with a variant&lt;/a&gt; first identified in the United Kingdom or one from South Africa compared with unvaccinated people, researchers reported April 9 in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Unvaccinated people, on the other hand, are vulnerable to all versions of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the cases in vaccinated people appeared to happen in a particular time frame, says Adi Stern, an evolutionary virologist at Tel Aviv University. People who caught the version of the virus that emerged in the United Kingdom were more likely to have received only one vaccine dose, perhaps because they did not yet have full protection. Those who got two doses were more likely to get infected with the version from South Africa, but only until two weeks after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that two-week period, Stern and her colleagues didn’t see breakthrough cases of the variant from South Africa. Although that variant isn’t very common in Israel, which could mean such cases were simply hard to find. “What we think happens is that immunity hasn’t reached its peak, that it’s on its way to reaching the peak,” Stern says. “That’s when we think that there’s an advantage” for the variant.       &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, infections can happen even in the face of a strong immune response from a vaccine. One patient in New York, for instance, developed COVID-19 symptoms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105000&quot;&gt;19 days after receiving a second dose of Moderna’s jab&lt;/a&gt;, despite having high levels of protective antibodies, researchers reported online April 21 in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The virus responsible for the infection had a mutation thought to help the coronavirus evade the immune system. But it is possible that the patient got infected before the second shot took full effect, the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important for experts to be aware of such cases and use them to gather more information, says Ezgi Hacisuleyman, an RNA biochemist at Rockefeller University in New York City and coauthor of the study. That way if there is an uptick of cases in immunized individuals, researchers can quickly pinpoint them and determine if it’s a case of a coronavirus variant skirting around a strong immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, there aren’t enough breakthrough infections pegged to variants to merit the use of updated shots. “There are going to be [breakthrough infections] no matter what,” Stern says. “We need to keep an eye on the variants, but still I think we also have to trust the vaccine itself because we have evidence: It works.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: A few simple tricks make fake news stories stick in the brain</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/misinformation-fake-news-stories-social-media-brain</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Bad information isn’t new. Propagandists and scam artists have been selling their brand of proverbial snake oil for ages, all to bend people’s thinking to their goals. What’s different today is that the digital world flings information faster and farther than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our brains can’t always keep up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because we often rely on quick estimates to figure out whether something is true. These shortcuts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/simple-rules-can-ease-complex-financial-decisions&quot;&gt;called heuristics&lt;/a&gt;, are often based on very simple patterns (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/20/14, p. 24&lt;/em&gt;). For instance, most information we come across in our daily lives is true. So when forced to guess, we often err on the side of believing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other shortcuts exist that encourage information — true or false — to find its way into our minds, research on human psychology shows. We take notice of information that is new, that fires up our emotions, that supports what we already believe and that we hear over and over.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, these shortcuts make us “super-efficient,” quickly leading us to the right answer, says cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Marsh of Duke University. But in fast-moving digital landscapes, those shortcuts are “going to get us in trouble,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How the various online platforms feed us information changes the game, as well. “We are not only contending with our own cognitive crutches as humans,” says Jevin West, a computational social scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle who cowrote the 2020 book &lt;em&gt;Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re also contending with a platform, and with algorithms and bots that know how to pierce into our cognitive frailties.” The goal, he says, is “to glue our eyeballs to those platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, scientists who study misinformation pull back the curtain on some false social media posts to show how bad information can creep into our minds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sharing what’s new&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People take special notice of fresh information. “Novelty has an advantage in the information economy in terms of spreading farther, faster, deeper,” says information scientist Sinan Aral of MIT and author of the 2020 book &lt;em&gt;The Hype Machine: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;And How We Must Adapt&lt;/em&gt;. Fresh intel can inform our beliefs, behaviors and predictions in powerful ways. In a study of Twitter behavior that spanned 10 years, Aral and his colleagues found &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146.long&quot;&gt;more signs of surprise&lt;/a&gt; — an indicator that information was new — in people’s responses to false news stories than to true ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharing new tidbits can also provide a status boost, as any internet influencer knows. “We gain in status when we share novel information,” Aral says. “It makes us look like we’re in the know.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New information becomes even more alluring in times of uncertainty, West says. That played out early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when researchers and physicians were scrambling to find life-saving treatments. Unproven methods — vitamins, garlic and hydroxychloroquine, among others — got lots of attention. “There were not a lot of answers on how to treat COVID early in the pandemic,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Misinformation: Natural “cure”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert’s review&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This tweet provides unequivocal, confident certainty with “cure” and it appeals to people’s beliefs [in natural remedies] with “pawpaw tree” and “garlic.” The author understands well these tricks. The consumer will want to believe this, and … be in the know by seeing it before their friends receive it as a share. &lt;br /&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Jevin West, University of Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-background&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f1e106;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; This box and those below show false statements found on social media or in the news. These examples, all misleading and untrue, show how misinformation can trick us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Supports prior beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accepting information that’s consistent with what we already know to be true can feel like a safe bet. We tend to give that sort of message less scrutiny. “It’s more comfortable to find pieces of information that fit our narrative,” West says. “And when we are confronted with information that breaks that narrative, that’s incredibly uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this reliance on our stored knowledge can lead us astray. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-050807&quot;&gt;People are wrong about a lot of facts&lt;/a&gt;, easily confuse facts and opinions and claim to know facts that are impossible, as Marsh and her colleague Nadia Brashier of Harvard University wrote in 2020 in &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. And with so much information streaming in, it’s easy to find the material that fits with what you think you know. “To the extent that I want to believe X, I can go out there and find evidence for X,” Marsh says. “If I were an anti-vaxxer, it wouldn’t matter how many times you told me that vaccines are good, because it would be against my world identity,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baseball legend and civil rights advocate Hank Aaron died on January 22 at age 86. Some people soon noted that he’d received a COVID-19 vaccine 17 days earlier. Anti-vaccine groups used his death to blame vaccines, with no evidence that the vaccine was involved. “It’s so opportunistic,” says global health researcher Tim Mackey of the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Expert’s review&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This one is very emotive. Most everyone knows Hank Aaron. [The post is] playing on [a] reaction of shock over his death (novel info) and then introducing misinformation that leads people to believe he died from the COVID-19 vaccine. The use of the [CBS Sports] link is compelling as it’s from a trusted news source, even though the link says nothing about Aaron dying from the vaccine. It almost makes him an unknowing martyr for the anti-vax movement. Aaron said he wanted to encourage vaccine uptake among African American people. His untimely death is instead used strategically to target this population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Tim Mackey, UC San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Tugs on emotions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Playing on emotions is the “dirtiest, easiest trick,” West says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outrage, fear and disgust can capture a reader’s attention. That’s what turned up in Aral’s analyses of over 126,000 instances of rumors spreading through tweets, reported in 2018 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. False rumors were more likely to inspire disgust than true information, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“False news is shocking, surprising, blood-boiling, anger-inducing,” Aral says. “That shock and awe combines with novelty to really get false news spreading at a much faster rate than true news.” The presence of emotional language &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7313&quot;&gt;increases the spread of social media messages by about 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; for each emotion-triggering word, researchers at New York University reported in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with message content, readers’ emotions matter, too. People who rely on emotions to assess a news story are &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3&quot;&gt;more likely to be duped by fake news&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation scientist Cameron Martel of MIT and colleagues reported in 2020 in &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[In studies], this headline was particularly evocative of both anger and anxiety, even relative to other false news headlines. I would guess that this has to do with the fact that the headline is tapping into both a common myth about (false) vaccine dangers, and focuses on potential harm to a vulnerable population (children). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Cameron Martel, MIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;On repeat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the most outlandish idea begins to sound less wild the 10th time we hear it. That’s been the case since long before the internet existed. In a 1945 study, people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/h0058110&quot;&gt;more inclined to believe rumors&lt;/a&gt; about wartime rationing that they had heard before rather than unfamiliar ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies have found similar effects for &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721419827854&quot;&gt;repetition&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon sometimes called the “illusory truth effect.” Even when people know a statement is false, hearing it again and again gives it more weight, Marsh says. “Keep it simple. Say it over and over.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of repetition to be found on Twitter, where hashtags can draw many people into a conversation, Mackey says. On July 27, 2020, then-President Donald Trump tweeted a link to a video of a doctor making false claims that hydroxychloroquine can cure COVID-19. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30318-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;Similar tweets exploded soon after&lt;/a&gt;, jumping from an average of about 29,000 daily tweets to over a million just a day later, Mackey and his colleagues reported in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt; in February. “It just takes one piece of misinformation for people to run with,” Mackey says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[The tweet about Gates and Fauci] was a pretty common theme. Repetition for this one is all about building an online campaign. Essentially propagation serves two roles: (1) getting [the fake message] out there that people who are against use of hydroxychloroquine are involved in a conspiracy to keep the treatment out of people’s hands; and (2) a campaign [to] force these public figures to actually get tested. &lt;em&gt;— Tim Mackey, UC San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: 2,500 years ago, the philosopher Anaxagoras brought science’s spirit to Athens</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/anaxagoras-science-athens-history-philosophy</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t appear that anybody has noticed yet, but 2021 marks a rather important anniversary in the history of science and western civilization. It was 2,500 years ago this year that a philosopher named Anaxagoras arrived in Athens, Greece.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nobody held any celebrations at the time, either. But it was nonetheless an important historical and intellectual landmark. Before Anaxagoras, ancient Greek science (or to be less anachronistic, natural philosophy) hadn’t actually been practiced much in Greece itself. Natural philosophy originated early in the sixth century B.C. at the Greek settlement Miletus in Ionia, the western coast of modern-day Turkey. A second branch of primordial Greek science soon took root in southern Italy after one Ionian, a math fan named Pythagoras, moved there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras, born in the Ionian town of Clazomenae, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/anaxagoras&quot;&gt;the first natural philosopher to reside in Athens&lt;/a&gt; and promote the Ionian philosophical outlook there. As the science historian George Sarton wrote, Anaxagoras “introduced the scientific spirit into Athens.” Soon after, Athens became the western world’s center of philosophical inquiry, as the triumvirate of Socrates, Plato and then Aristotle established philosophy as an essential component of civilized intellectual discourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there is some doubt about the exact date of Anaxagoras’ move to Athens. But the biographer of philosophers Diogenes Laertius wrote that Anaxagoras &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D3&quot;&gt;began to do philosophy in Athens at the age of 20&lt;/a&gt;, and says he was 20 years old when the Persian king Xerxes attacked Greece &lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; and that was 480 B.C., 2,500 years ago. (You might think that 2021 would make that 2,501 years ago, but only if you forgot that there was no year 0, so you have to subtract one year from the calculation.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that during his time in Athens, Anaxagoras met the young Socrates, but the direct link to Socrates and his philosophical descendants was through the philosopher Archelaus. Anaxagoras “was the first to stimulate Archelaus the Athenian to practice philosophy,” wrote the famous physician Galen. And Archelaus was the teacher of Socrates, who taught Plato, who taught Aristotle, whose influence dominated science for two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras came along about a century after the first Ionian philosophers, Thales of Miletus and his younger Milesian contemporary Anaximander. Along with a third Milesian, Anaximenes, they had established a new way of viewing the natural world. They sought explanations for phenomena in natural causes, rather than ascribing them to the behavior of mythological gods invented by poets to explain cosmic history. No longer was lightning a sign of an angry Zeus, declared Anaximander — rather it flashed when clouds were disrupted by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the original Milesians did not agree on all issues, they did all insist that natural philosophy should be based on an underlying foundation (called the &lt;em&gt;arche&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;arkhé&lt;/em&gt;), a principle from which all of reality could be derived. “The notions of beginning, origin, governing principle and cause were closely united in the single word &lt;em&gt;arche&lt;/em&gt;,” wrote the philosopher-historian William Guthrie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thales thought that the fundamental principle was water; Anaximenes said air. Anaximander thought everything arose from a mysterious material called the &lt;em&gt;apeiron&lt;/em&gt;, which means something like the unlimited or the boundless. Over in Italy, the Pythagoreans promoted the idea that the underlying foundation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-did-pythagoras-mean-by-all-things-are-number-1717748417&quot;&gt;everything was number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Anaxagoras, the &lt;em&gt;arche&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;nous&lt;/em&gt;, or “mind” (sometimes translated as “intellect” or “intelligence”). His approach extended the scientific ideas of his Ionian predecessors to address issues posed by the Italian philosopher Parmenides. Everything had to always be as it is, Parmenides reasoned, because nothing could come to be out of nothing — nonexistence could not produce existence, because there is no such thing as nonexistence, by definition of existence. Reality consisted in an ever-present, unchanging, unmovable mass of undifferentiated sameness that filled all of space, Parmenides concluded. There was therefore no room for any motion, or any change — the world perceived by the senses was false, an illusion concealing the true nature of reality. Senses offered a “way of seeming”; only reason provided the “way of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it sounds whacko to modern ears, in those days it was a hard argument to refute. But Anaxagoras had a sophisticated and subtle mind; in responding to Parmenides, he introduced an entirely new idea about fundamental reality, contending that all the different sorts of matter are already present in any given piece of matter. No new thing has to “come into being,” because all possible things already exist to begin with and continue to exist in everything — even if in amounts too small for the senses to detect. A lump of supposedly pure gold, for instance, also contains tiny “seeds” of every other sort of matter. Our senses are just too coarse to notice the seeds. (For that matter, the seeds themselves contained smaller amounts of everything, also. Anaxagoras had conceived the notion of infinite divisibility, another novel thought.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any piece of matter could seem to change into something else by virtue of shifts in the relative amounts of its seeds. Eating vegetables, for instance, could produce flesh and bone in your body because the digestive process concentrated the flesh and bone seeds that were imperceptibly diffuse in the original food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, all matter was one big static mass. At some point in the past, &lt;em&gt;nous&lt;/em&gt;, or mind, set that mass into whirling motion, concentrating heavy stuff (like earth) in the middle, creating the Earth. Chunks of earth whirled outward became stars and the sun and the moon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras’ &lt;em&gt;nous&lt;/em&gt; was the one distinctive ingredient in his system. Other stuff was all mixed with everything else. But mind was its own thing. “Mind is something infinite and independent and is mixed with nothing,” he wrote. But mind (while maintaining its purity) is present in many things, including all people, called by Anaxagoras “the wisest of animals.” (Guthrie recounts that when asked why some people don’t seem so wise, “Anaxagoras is said to have remarked that though all men have intellect they do not always use it.”)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite his own considerable intellect, Anaxagoras’ theory of matter was wrong. But his reputation rests on many other contributions to scientific thought. A century ago, Thomas Heath, the eminent scholar of Greek science and math, declared that Anaxagoras was “a great man of science” who “enriched astronomy by one epoch-making discovery”: that the light of the moon is not its own, but a reflection of light from the sun. (Some scholars say he got the idea from Parmenides, but in any case, it is still very deserving for a crater near the moon’s north pole to be named Anaxagoras.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras wrote a treatise covering many other scientific subjects, including meteorology and geology. He supposedly predicted that a rock could fall to Earth from the sky; in any case, he was awarded credit for such a prediction &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002JAHH....5..135T&quot;&gt;when a meteorite fell in Thrace&lt;/a&gt; (now Turkey) in 467 B.C. He argued that the Earth was flat, though. And that it was supported in space by the air beneath it, echoing his Ionian predecessor Anaximenes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras’ scientific importance rests, however, not on the accuracy of his theories but rather on the insightfulness of his attitude. He expressed a scientific attitude renouncing the supernatural more clearly than his predecessors. Even Thales felt that “there were gods in all things,” Aristotle had written, and Thales and others had attributed souls to heavenly bodies. From his known writings there is no sign that Anaxagoras’ &lt;em&gt;nous&lt;/em&gt; was in any sense religious — it was a natural component of the cosmos, giving it direction, just as the human mind induces a human body to move its limbs. “He nowhere in the extant material identifies mind with a divine principle or god,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaxagoras/&quot;&gt;as one scholar has noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more profoundly, Anaxagoras identified a key issue that has perplexed practitioners of science ever since — the relationship between reason and the senses. It was absolute devotion to reason — and absolute disregard for the senses — that led Parmenides to declare reason the way of truth and sensible phenomena illusory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras fully agreed that the senses could be misleading, calling them “feeble” and unable “to distinguish what is true.” Human senses are simply not acute enough to perceive reality in full HD clarity. There is more to reality than what we can see. But — the key point — with senses complemented by intellect, we can infer much about the deeper, unseen reality from what we do see, Anaxagoras realized. “Appearances are vision of things that are invisible,” he wrote, or in another translation, “phenomena are a sight of the unseen.” Reality is richer than what it immediately appears, yet the human mind remains capable of exploring it, and finding out a lot about it. And with that realization, progress in the scientific understanding of reality became possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naturally enough, Anaxagoras’ emphasis on natural explanations and his disdain for the gods got him in trouble. Athenian officials charged him with impiety, convicted him and sentenced him, by some accounts to death, by others just to prison. His friend the Athenian politician Pericles intervened to arrange banishment, and Anaxagoras spent his last years in Lampsacus, a city in what is now northwestern Turkey, where he was revered as a champion of mind, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If somebody else has treated you badly, what are the best strategies for overcoming this, and moving on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been, of course, an enormous amount of research in this field, in relation to everything from getting over a romantic break-up to coping with the after-effects of civil war. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64856-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, led by Saima Noreen at De Montfort University, specifically investigates how different types of forgiveness towards an offender can help people who are intentionally trying to forget an unpleasant incident.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41993&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, “intentional forgetting” involves actively trying to suppress memories of an unpleasant experience. Recent studies have suggested that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(18)30177-3?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661318301773?showall=true&quot;&gt;lessens the associated negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;. Forgiveness has been more extensively investigated, and there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965714_Forgiveness_interventions_and_the_promotion_of_resilience_following_interpersonal_stress_and_trauma&quot;&gt;work finding that forgiving the perpetrator helps&lt;/a&gt; (though of course not all victims feel able or willing to forgive, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/invisible-illness/does-healing-from-trauma-require-forgiveness-e5906fdf0149&quot;&gt;forgiveness is not an essential component of recovery&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noreen and her colleagues set out to explore possible interactions between intentional forgetting and “decisional” vs “emotional” forgiveness. Decisional forgiveness is making the decision to forgive the perpetrator, and not to seek revenge — indeed, even to make efforts to maintain a relationship — but while still bearing a grudge. In contrast, emotional forgiveness involves getting rid of negative emotions towards the perpetrator and replacing them with positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In initial studies, the team presented online participants with this scenario: just as they are about to move in with their partner, they discover that their partner is having an affair. Participants were then encouraged to forget details  associated with this hypothetical unpleasant experience (e.g. a list of adjectives that described the offender). Some were also instructed to forgive the offender either through emotional forgiveness (to “wish that the offender experiences something positive or healing and to focus their thoughts and feelings on empathy”) or decisional forgiveness (“think of the offender as someone who has behaved badly and that you have resolved not to pay her/him back and to treat him/her in a positive, rather than a negative way”.)  Others had no forgiveness intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that participants in the emotional forgiveness group showed greater forgetting of the detail, though not the gist, of the offence than the other groups. These participants also reported feeling more psychological distance from the offence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies involved hypothetical offences, however. For the final online, two-stage study, the team recruited 360 fresh participants. In the first of two sessions, these people were guided to write in detail about a time in their life when someone close to them had done something that deeply offended, harmed or hurt them and that still left them feeling angry or resentful. Next, they rated various aspects of this experience, including the extent to which they had forgiven the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 11 days later, these participants then completed the second session. This included the same three-group forgiveness intervention as in the earlier studies. The team’s analysis revealed that for these participants, emotional, but not decisional, forgiveness was associated with greater forgetting of the detail of the original transgression (though again not the gist of it). It was also associated with a shift to reporting feeling more forgiveness for the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, our findings suggest that the act of emotional forgiveness leads to a transgression becoming more psychologically distant, such that victims will construe the event at a higher and more abstract level,” the team writes. (In other words, retaining the gist, but not all the detail). “This high-level construal, in turn, promotes larger intentional forgetting effects, which, in turn, promote increased emotional forgiveness,” they go on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research does support some earlier suggestions that to function as a coping strategy, forgiveness should take an emotional form. And there are clear potential implications for strategies designed to help people recover psychologically from an offence. However, more work is clearly needed to explore this apparent “virtuous circle”, and to get a better handle on potential effects in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64856-001&quot;&gt;Moving on or deciding to let go? A pathway exploring the relationship between emotional and decisional forgiveness and intentional forgetting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Meet three moderators fighting disinformation on Reddit’s largest coronavirus forum</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-reddit-covid-misinformation-moderators</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combating misinformation online is an ongoing challenge for big tech, and it’s especially difficult when it’s on a discussion board with millions of people during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One such place is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/&quot;&gt;r/Coronavirus community&lt;/a&gt; on the website Reddit. In January 2020, it had around 1,000 members. That number spiked to 1.5 million by March of 2020, partly due to Reddit highlighting it on their homepage &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04816.pdf&quot;&gt;over any of the other&lt;/a&gt; related subreddits. Today, the page has 2.4 million users, with around 10,000 new comments a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The forum has become a one-stop shop for up-to-date coronavirus information, offering up pandemic news, locations of vaccination sites and how to sign up for clinical trials. The community has also hosted Q&amp;amp;A discussions with the likes of Bill Gates and Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as top researchers. Even Reddit CEO Steve Huffman reached out to the volunteers who moderate the forum to tell them that he starts his day by reading it and to thank them for their work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the work these moderators do isn’t easy, as the forum is also a breeding ground for misinformation. They work tirelessly to make sure the information on the subreddit is reliable, taking time away from their jobs as doctors, researchers and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; spoke to three of these moderators about what it’s like to combat misinformation online during a pandemic. Head moderator Patrick Doherty is a biotech research scientist; Jennifer Cole is a biological anthropologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who studies online communities related to health and became an infodemic manager, after receiving training from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1&quot;&gt;World Health Organization initiative to fight misinformation&lt;/a&gt;; and Rohan — who requested not to use his full name due to the daily harassment he receives on Reddit — is a M.D./Ph.D. student in molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answers have been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt; How did you become a moderator?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doherty: &lt;/strong&gt;I actually was recruited by one of the other moderators. At the start of the pandemic, there was a lot of really bad preprint papers that were coming out. And one that came out was about how … the coronavirus could have potentially been manufactured in a lab using an HIV strain. A [Reddit] user had posted it. So I had written a detailed comment in response, explaining why the paper was bad and why the results didn’t mean anything. The paper eventually ended up getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature&quot;&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). The moderators saw my comment and liked how I expressed the science, so they invited me to a be a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohan:&lt;/strong&gt; I started in September 2020, the day before [then-President Donald] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-how-trump-covid-19-treatments-work-together&quot;&gt;Trump tested positive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/5/20&lt;/em&gt;). Over the course of the previous six months of the pandemic, I had seen a lot of misinformation on the subreddit. I wanted to contribute to removing some of that stuff, and I also thought there was a lot of opportunity for the subreddit to run special projects, like motivate people to get vaccines or help them find vaccination locations. And I thought given my background, I would be able to give some help with that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;Has there been anything that’s surprised you about moderating r/Coronavirus?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cole:&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly, largely no. Because I’ve done this before with Ebola. There’s been nothing different in this pandemic to what there was in Ebola, there’s just been more of it. The scale has been different, but the kind of conspiracy theories you see and the kind of things people say are no different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;What is it like moderating every day? How often do you take breaks?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doherty:&lt;/strong&gt; It can be kind of soul crushing sometimes, especially when there wasn’t a lot of good news. Now there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-cdc-fully-vaccinated-people-guidelines-social-distancing&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/30/21; SN: 3/8/21&lt;/em&gt;) . But before, every day, I was opening up the sub, and every morning I would read the front page of our subreddit, and it was all just bad news. It can be a lot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohan:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s an ebb and flow to how much time it takes to moderate. For example, if there’s big news about a vaccine being approved, then we’ll all just be spending a significant portion of the day answering user questions and combating misinformation. But just general day-to-day management, it’s a pretty large team and we try to coordinate with each other. It does take a lot of collective time, and we try to make sure that if someone’s having a busy day or week, then we try to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;How do you distinguish between misinformation that should be taken down versus a genuine question?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cole:&lt;/strong&gt; At first, instead of just removing somebody, we engage with them. If their information is wrong, we explain why it’s wrong. And certainly the first time that users post something that is wrong, we will try and correct them and push them in the direction of the better information. If they keep coming back obviously trying to push a narrative, that’s when we will ban them. You do need to make a distinction between people who might have heard it somewhere and don’t understand it very well and need you to explain it to them a bit better, versus people who are trying to push a narrative. Sometimes we’ll check on users’ posting history and what else they’re posting elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doherty:&lt;/strong&gt; Misinformation is really hard to combat, because someone can post two sentences of made-up stuff, which takes them only five seconds. But If I want to refute that, I have to find one source, then two sources, then three sources, and a breakdown scientifically of why that’s not true. I can’t just say “no, it doesn’t,” because then you’re just leaving it to the reader about who they trust more. Whereas you have to go and find sources and show why you’re right and that takes time. It’s really easy to share a meme and get 25,000 likes and people are convinced that it’s true, and it only took that person 10 seconds to make it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;I’m sure banning people leads to harassment. Have you been harassed?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doherty:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve never been doxed [that’s when someone publishes private personal information online]. I keep my name separate from my username. I never say who I am on the subreddit. But if you delete someone’s comment, I’ve had someone say “slit your throat” or just really awful death threat sort of stuff. You can report that to Reddit, and they’ll ban the user from the site for things like that, but we get a lot of stuff like that. You get used to it, but you don’t really get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohan:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the nasty direct messages are just vitriol or people being nasty. That’s essentially a daily occurrence. And not infrequently, but multiple times in a day. Beyond that, there’s more minor threats such as “Oh, I’ll report you” or “Oh, soon you will be revealed and exposed as a shill.” Those probably come a few times a week, more frequently if it’s a busy period or particularly sensitive topic. The serious threats, like the threats of actual harm to me, are fortunately significantly rarer. Usually, it’s someone saying they’ll dox me or that they’ll “find me” and that I should kill myself. Those are unpleasant, but significantly rarer, probably on the order of a month or more in between.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cole:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve had attacks that I’d describe as pathetic. They’re not scary or frightening. But part of the ethics agreement with my university is that if I do research on these online communities, I do it under my own name so that it’s transparent. My university is aware that I do this. My campus security also knows. One thing that people online do is say things like “we know where you work.” But do they ever go as far as contacting the university? No, they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;How has r/Coronavirus changed over the past year?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s shifted from being just a place to get news about the pandemic and its response, and more of a place to get information that’s actually more actionable for the users. So for example, one of our moderators put together a wonderful list of vaccine location resources from around the U.S., Canada and even around the world. And I run a piece that answers user questions on the vaccines, so I have a little write-up about what we know about vaccines. And in the comments, users can come ask questions, and I try my best within 24 hours to answer any of those questions or tell them to go talk to their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;Dealing with sad news and mad people every day sounds bad for mental health. Why do you keep at it?&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohan:&lt;/strong&gt; Being able to just sit down and methodically answer vaccine questions and address concerns is probably one of my favorite parts of doing this. There was one person who was talking about how their family has some history of medical conditions, and that they are scared and didn’t think they’d get the vaccine. They wanted someone to explain a couple of questions to them. I remember I went back and forth with this user probably five times over the course of several hours that day. At the end of it, they told me they were going to go get the vaccine as soon as they were eligible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doherty:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve really grown to like the community that I’ve helped build. We’ve learned a lot about what’s misinformation and what’s not misinformation. It’s sort of a learned skill. Not that we’re 100 percent perfect, but I just feel like we have a unique skillset at this point, and it’d feel wrong to stop. I’d feel guilty. Also, the team. The moderators have become good friends. We do Zoom hangouts and happy hours, and we joke about hanging out when this is all over. We’ve become a real group of friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: The surge in U.S. coronavirus cases shows a shift in who’s getting sick</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-surge-4th-wave-us-young-cases-vaccination</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When COVID-19 cases once again began rising in the United States this spring, it may have felt like déjà vu, a repeat of the early months of the pandemic. While cases are now starting to drop in many, but not all, of the hot spots, the country is still seeing upwards of 50,000 new cases a day, and for a few days in mid-April, those numbers topped 70,000, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases&quot;&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. This may seem more manageable than the 200,000-plus case days in December and January, but the latest numbers are comparable to the case counts during last summer’s surge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, though, the demographics of many of the people getting sick are different: While it varies by state, they’re typically younger, and remain at risk because they are not yet vaccinated. More transmissible coronavirus variants, particularly one called B.1.1.7, appear to be driving the new surge. And, as businesses continue to reopen and vaccination efforts run into low demand, public health experts worry that the same communities that have been vulnerable throughout the pandemic may be hit hard all over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;New cases by the numbers&lt;/h4&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the past year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics&quot;&gt;demographic trends among individuals infected with COVID-19 &lt;/a&gt;have shown that adults over the age of 65 have been more likely to die from the disease. Black residents, Hispanic/Latino residents and other minority groups, have been both more likely to get sick and more likely to face severe illness. Now, however, vaccinations are protecting a majority of seniors, while many minority communities and not-yet-vaccinated younger adults, those under age 50, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime&quot;&gt;remain vulnerable to infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this younger crowd isn’t just getting asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases: A greater share of those now hospitalized are younger adults compared to their share of total hospitalizations in earlier months. Nationwide, about 9,000 COVID-19 patients under age 50 were admitted to hospitals in the second week of April, compared with about 6,000 people in that age group a month earlier — while admissions for patients over age 60 have stayed at constant levels since late February. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This trend is more pronounced in states with surging case numbers. Michigan, for example, saw about 1,000 new adult patients under age 50 admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 cases in the week ending April 9, compared with under 300 patients in that age group in the first week of 2021, during the peak of the winter surge. Those younger patients made up just 17 percent of all patients in Michigan during that earlier week, but 29 percent three months later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Age trends&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the winter surge, the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to U.S. hospitals dropped dramatically, then rose to its current level of about 30,000 new patients admitted each week. Younger patients, those under age 50, are now making up a bigger share of the cases than earlier in the pandemic. That trend is most apparent in hard-hit states like Michigan, where almost 4,000 new COVID-19 patients were hospitalized each week in late March and early April 2021.Use the drop-down menu and age-group selector to see hospitalization numbers for different states and ages. The chart’s y-axis varies by state to account for differences in state population.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations do help. Yet while younger adults reached the front of the vaccine line only in recent weeks, many eligible residents in minority communities have struggled to get a vaccine since the rollout began. Polling data show that they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://rollcall.com/2021/04/13/broader-vaccine-eligibility-may-exacerbate-racial-inequities/&quot;&gt;just as willing (if not more) to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; than their white neighbors, but are having trouble getting access to shots. A majority of states, for example, have vaccinated at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/us-vaccine-demographics.html&quot;&gt;25 percent of their white populations&lt;/a&gt;, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, but only 12 states have vaccinated the same share of their Black populations as of April 26. And only nine states have reached that milestone with Hispanic/Latino populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers are concerning, says Enrique Neblett, a health behavior expert at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and associate director of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center. Neblett has seen how access issues disrupt vaccination first-hand through his work in Detroit. “The folks on the ground [community organizers in Detroit] were saying things like, they were not seeing a lot of hesitancy, but it was more around access to the vaccine, transportation, work hours,” he says. These barriers are common in already-vulnerable communities, leaving individuals living there more susceptible during this new surge, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability has consequences. During the winter of 2020, racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization rates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7015e2.htm?s_cid=mm7015e2_w&quot;&gt;became less severe &lt;/a&gt;compared with the earlier months of the pandemic. But Neblett says he worries that a lack of vaccine access, coupled with the longstanding differences in health care access, employment and other institutional and culture factors that caused these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race&quot;&gt;COVID-19 disparities&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, may revert this pattern in the coming months (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard to say, but I do think if we don’t get a handle on this, it’s very likely that we could see those disparities start to increase again,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;New variants’ role in rising cases&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One reason for the rise in cases is that the coronavirus is mutating, creating variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that initially seeded infections. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm&quot;&gt;B.1.1.7, a variant first identified in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, was causing more cases in the United States than any other version of the coronavirus — &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-proportions.html#variant-proportions&quot;&gt;an estimated 59 percent of cases&lt;/a&gt; nationwide as of April 10, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines currently in use in the United States are demonstrably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/well/live/covid-variants-vaccine.html&quot;&gt;effective against B.1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you may be protected from severe disease even if you get sick with this variant. But B.1.1.7 is estimated to be between 40 percent to 70 percent more transmissible, so it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-b117-variant-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;can spread more easily&lt;/a&gt; among people who haven’t yet received a vaccine (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/19/21&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B.1.1.7 takeover&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since B.1.1.7 first arrived in the United States in December, this coronavirus variant has spread throughout the country: It now causes a majority of cases, with especially high numbers in Michigan, Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Use the drop-down menu to see the trend in select states where Helix, which does PCR and genetic testing of the virus, has active test sites. The chart’s y-axis varies by state to account for differences in state population.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s almost two pandemics happening,” says Will Lee, head of science at the genomics company Helix, which has been working with the CDC to track variant cases through testing and genetic sequencing. “One of which is original SARS-CoV-2, and the other one, which is B.1.1.7.” Since B.1.1.7 is so much more transmissible, Lee says, we can think of it as akin to a new disease, with its own infection patterns and outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee says that the United Kingdom’s winter outbreak shows how B.1.1.7 cases can rise in a region even as cases caused by older variants decrease. Michigan’s surge in cases is following a similar pattern. From mid-March to mid-April, B.1.1.7 made up an estimated 70 percent of cases in the state, which had identified its first case with the variant only in mid-January. And the variant is clearly having an impact: Michigan accounted for 10 percent of new COVID-19 cases nationwide the week of April 8 to 14, while the state represents only 3 percent of the nation’s population. Hospitals in the state &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/04/08/um-surgeon-plea-whitmer-white-house-covid-19-hospitalizations-surging/7141718002/&quot;&gt;cancelled elective surgeries&lt;/a&gt; to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. And Michigan is not the only state with a B.1.1.7 problem: almost three in four cases in Tennessee, Minnesota and Florida are now caused by B.1.1.7, the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shifting share&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Minnesota, Florida and Tennessee are among the states seeing a surge in cases driven by the more transmissible B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant. While some states saw a steeper rise than others, the data show that younger patients, under the age of 50, are making up a bigger share of those going to the hospital compared with the share of total cases for this age group earlier in 2021. The chart’s y-axis varies by state to account for differences in state population. Use the age-group selector to see numbers for different ages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other parts of the country are dealing with other variants that are not as well-studied. In California, 39 percent of cases are caused by B.1.427/B.1.429, a pair of variants that are more transmissible and not as responsive to the drugs that doctors have been using to treat COVID-19. The California variants are also spreading readily in Arizona (31 percent of cases), Colorado (25 percent) and other states in the Midwest. A home-grown variant has been identified in New York City, too, and that one is causing more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It takes time to do the genetic testing needed to identify these variant cases — and the United States is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00908-0&quot;&gt;struggling to scale up&lt;/a&gt; its national surveillance efforts — so these data are a snapshot from mid-April. Since then, the new outbreaks from B.1.1.7 and other variants have likely grown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, variants aren’t fully to blame for the steep rise in cases. “I don’t think there’s ever any one factor that drives everything we see,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. While B.1.1.7 and other emerging variants can speed up case increases, Dean notes, there have been other contributing factors in recent months, such as businesses reopening and behavior changes putting people in closer quarters, spurring the virus’ spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;States’ snapshot&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caption: While Michigan saw the most concerning rises in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, other states also contributed to the recent surge. Use the drop-down menu to see how your state is faring on four metrics: all new cases; new cases caused by the B.1.1.7 variant; hospitalizations; and vaccinations. Each metric has a different scale going from the lowest to highest values for that metric, as this shows the state-by-state trends more clearly than a 0–100 percent scale.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;States from California to Connecticut have eased up on mask mandates, indoor capacity limits and other restrictions. Such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening&quot;&gt;reopenings can drive outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in larger communities as people who get infected at a restaurant or a football game interact with others who did not choose to enter a riskier setting (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/18/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prisons and jails are particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/covidspread.html&quot;&gt;likely to cause outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in their surrounding communities, too. Many incarcerated Americans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/04/06/as-states-expand-vaccine-eligibility-many-people-in-prison-still-wait-for-shots&quot;&gt;have yet to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; — unlike nursing home residents, another group living in close quarters. Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility, a prison in Michigan, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/02/18/bellamy-creek-prison-b-117-covid-variant/6780664002/&quot;&gt;a major B.1.1.7 outbreak site in February&lt;/a&gt;, which seeded other cases in the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, amid this latest surge, there’s one crucial metric that has stayed mercifully low: the death rate. The daily average for deaths has &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths&quot;&gt;stayed below 1,000 since mid-March&lt;/a&gt;. This number suggests in part that, so far, the vaccines are protecting many of the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s not enough. In order for us to control the new rise in cases, the United States will need enough people vaccinated to stop new infections. Dean considers Michigan as a warning to other states of how quickly new outbreaks may pick up, but she says it’s not a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every day that we vaccinate more people, we’re making that [trajectory] less likely,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The threat looms large for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-for-thought/wheat-warning-new-rust-could-spread-wildfire&quot;&gt;food staples of the world&lt;/a&gt; such as rice, wheat, potatoes and maize (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/22/05&lt;/em&gt;). Pathogenic fungi are also coming for our coffee, sugarcane, bananas and other economically important crops. Annually, fungal diseases destroy a third of all harvests and pose a dire threat to global food security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stop the spread of fungal diseases, farmers fumigate the soil with toxic chemicals that lay waste to the land, sparing not even the beneficial microbes teeming in the earth. Or they ply plants with fungicides. But fungicide use is effective only in the short run — until the pathogenic fungi evolve resistance against these synthetic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new idea is taking root: Help plants stand their ground by giving them the tools to fight their own battles. A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants’ innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding. Over the past few years, the researchers have devised various nanonutrient concoctions that boost the fungal resistance of soybeans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04546&quot;&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c07126&quot;&gt;watermelons&lt;/a&gt; and, recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS-07-20-1636-RE&quot;&gt;eggplants&lt;/a&gt;, as reported in the April &lt;em&gt;Plant Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept “tackles the challenge at the origin rather than trying to put a Band-Aid on the [problem],” says Leanne Gilbertson, an environmental engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the research. White’s strategy provides plants with the nutrients they need to trigger enzyme production to guard against pathogenic attack. Without any synthetic chemicals introduced, the strategy sidesteps any opportunity for malignant fungi to develop resistances, she says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ nanomaterials approach is inspired by their earlier discovery that nanoparticles transported up from the roots of maize can loop back down from the leaves. The researchers dipped half of the root fibers of a single maize plant in a copper nanoparticle formulation and the other half in pure water. The copper showed up in the water-dipped roots, pointing to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es204212z&quot;&gt;roots-to-shoot-to-roots roundtrip&lt;/a&gt;, White and his colleagues reported in 2012 in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/em&gt;. That finding suggested that nanoparticles can be applied directly to the leaves in the first place, even when the target destination was the roots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the leaves as an entrance point gets around a perennial problem: Delivering dissolved nutrients through the soil is hardly efficient. Chemicals may break down in the soil, vaporize into the atmosphere or leach away. Only about 20 percent of watered nutrients eventually reach the target areas in a plant. “By using the nanoscale form, we can actually more effectively deliver [nutrients] where we want it and where the plant needs it,” White says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see if this approach could deliver nutrients specifically needed in defense against hostile fungi, White and colleagues carried out tests in eggplants and tomatoes. The team sprayed metallic nanoparticles onto the leaves and shoots of young plants, then infected the plants with pathogenic fungi. The nanoparticle-treated plants had &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/EN/C6EN00146G#!divAbstract&quot;&gt;elevated levels of nutritional metals in the roots and higher produce yields&lt;/a&gt; compared with the plants fed readily dissolved nutrients, the team reported in 2016 in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science: Nano&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nanoparticles weren’t harming the fungi, the researchers found: The fungi still thrived amidst nanoparticles in the environment without the host plant present. Instead, the nanoparticles’ antifungal properties stem from providing plant nourishment — equivalent to humans taking nutritional supplements — that allows plants to mount an appropriate defense on demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes nanonutrients more potent than common fertilizers is the sweet spot in their sizes, which control how fast they dissolve, says Fabienne Schwab, an environmental chemist not involved in the research. Nanonutrients are thousands of times smaller than the diameter of human hair and thousands of times larger than readily dissolved nutrient salts. They have a large, exposed surface, so they dissolve more quickly than a heftier chunk of the same nutrient. Yet nanonutrients are big enough that that they don’t dissolve all at once: They can gradually release the nutrients over weeks. In contrast, readily dissolved nutrients give plants a temporary nutrient spike, akin to a sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you use [nutrients] at the nanoscale, you can tune the solubility pretty much the way you like,” says Schwab, of the Adolphe Merkle Institute in Fribourg, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the size that can be tuned — the shape, composition and surface chemistries can be modified to stimulate different levels of a plant’s responses. For instance, White and his collaborators found that nanometer-thin copper oxide sheets were better than spherical copper nanoparticles at preventing &lt;em&gt;Fusarium virguliforme&lt;/em&gt; infection in soybeans. The key to their effectiveness lay in the nanosheets’ quicker release of charged copper atoms and stronger adhesion to leaf surfaces. The copper nanomaterials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-00776-1&quot;&gt;restored&lt;/a&gt; the soybean’s masses and photosynthesis rates to the levels of disease-free plants, the team reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very promising technology,” says Schwab, but she adds that there are other aspects to consider before its implementation. If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as — perhaps even more challengingly — overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials’ persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People in general get nervous when you talk about nanotechnology and food,” says White. But he says his group isn’t using any exotic materials, whose health impacts remain complete enigmas. Instead “we’re using nutrients the plants need [that] they just can’t get enough of.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White says he has eaten the eggplants, tomatoes and watermelons he’s grown for his research. And perhaps that’s the best reassurance consumers can get: a toxicologist trying the literal fruit of his labor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: The book ‘Viral BS’ offers a cure for medical myths and fake health news</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viral-bs-book-review-seema-yasmin-medical-myths-fake-health-news</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781421440408&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099138&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/050821_reviews_bookcover-298x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;182&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781421440408&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Viral BS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seema Yasmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johns Hopkins Univ., $24.95&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does misinformation spread? What causes medical myths and pseudoscience to rapidly infect and fester in society? Seema Yasmin, an epidemiologist and author of a new book, &lt;em&gt;Viral BS&lt;/em&gt;, has a diagnosis: the pervasive, persuasive power of storytelling. And, as Yasmin notes, “The more fantastical, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take the anecdote that opens the book: A woman in Texas demands an Ebola vaccine for her daughter as a deadly outbreak rages a continent away in Africa in 2014. When the pediatrician tells her there is no Ebola vaccine and that her daughter faces a much greater risk from the flu, for which he can give her a vaccine, the mother storms out: “Flu vaccine?! I don’t believe in those things!”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Stories — like those this Texas woman may have heard, or maybe told herself — help us find order in a world bursting with uncertainty. But when these stories don’t reflect reality, a public malady of tenacious and preposterous medical myths can take hold, Yasmin explains. Her book sets out to treat this malady with a dose of the virus itself: Storytelling and anecdotes that move beyond dry facts and figures to reveal pseudoscience’s sticking power.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yasmin sets up her credentials in the book’s opener — physician, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative, former epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — to build trust among readers. But, true to form, it’s her anecdotes of pseudoscience in her own upbringing that linger. Her India-born grandmother told her that the moon landing was a fake; as a child Yasmin would pray to the “unwalked upon moon” for clarity and vision. Yasmin and her cousins once secretly listened to Michael Jackson songs for signs of Satan worship — which an older cousin claimed were there. “Raised on conspiracy theories,” she writes, “I understand why a patient might refuse medications, say chemtrails are poison, or shun vaccines, even as I bristle at the public health implications of these beliefs and behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Each chapter answers a question in a few pages of no-nonsense basics. The book tackles a slew of questions that have spread from the internet to dinner tables in recent years. These include: Is there lead in your lipstick? Do vaccines cause autism? Has the U.S. government banned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-research-faces-roadblocks-and-dearth-data&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research about gun violence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/14/16, p. 16&lt;/em&gt;)? She analyzes the pseudoscientific answers that become hard to shake and reviews related research that presents the truth. The antidote is easy to swallow, thanks to Yasmin’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance: Should you eat your baby’s placenta? In chapter 2’s breezy three pages, Yasmin points to celebrities such as Kim Kardashian who say eating their placentas helped them with postpartum recovery. Then Yasmin quickly moves to studies that have found no medical benefits. In fact, studies point to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/oregon-newborn-infection-placenta-pills&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;potential harm&lt;/a&gt; from the practice, since the organ can carry feces, inflammatory cells and bacteria (&lt;em&gt;SN Online: 7/28/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She pulls no punches, referring to doctors who claim to be able to cure autism as “charlatans” who offer expensive, unproven and sometimes dangerous practices. Children have died, Yasmin writes, after being given Miracle Mineral Solution as an autism cure. The solution is actually industrial bleach. She rejects the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vitamin-d-supplements-lose-luster&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overenthusiastic prescribing of vitamin D supplements&lt;/a&gt; for everything from obesity to cancer (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/2/19, p. 16&lt;/em&gt;), showing that the evidence of a benefit isn’t there, at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues she addresses seem ludicrous on first glance, like “Can a pill make racists less racist?” Actress Roseanne Barr claimed that the drug Ambien made her post a racist tweet in 2018. Yasmin looks at the opposite notion, sparked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-012-2657-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; that linked heart disease medications to a reduction in racial bias. She explains how the drugs affect the body and how researchers tested for racial bias. Then she shifts to the dangers of trying to medicalize racism, which is not a medical phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book ends with a tear-out “bullshit detection kit,” a list of 12 useful tips to keep in mind when weighing the credibility of a headline, research study or tweet. Questions to consider include: Who is funding the person or organization making the claim? Has a claim been verified by those not affiliated with the source? She explains how to run a reverse online search on an image to determine whether it was doctored and to learn its original source. This list will be particularly relevant to those navigating through all the misinformation swirling around COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readers will come away from this book with a deeper understanding of what research studies can and cannot say, and the effects that storytelling and celebrity have on whether someone internalizes a health claim. Some readers might prefer more background science for each question — for a book that aims to crush pseudoscience, a bibliography or at least footnotes would have been useful. But perhaps this omission is part of Yasmin’s broader point. For casual readers, references and statistics miss the mark. Instead, anecdotes in easy-to-swallow doses may be just the right amount of information and storytelling needed to stop the spread of viral BS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Heating up the objective for two-photon imaging</title>
	<link>https://gcamp6f.com/2021/05/01/heating-up-the-objective-for-two-photon-imaging/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012&quot;&gt;Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Is this a problem?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493&quot;&gt;Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater&quot;&gt;objective heating device&lt;/a&gt; with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038&quot;&gt;Serge Charpak&lt;/a&gt; was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html&quot;&gt;thermocouple&lt;/a&gt; element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6792&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6792&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;heating_pad&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,606&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6794&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6794&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;constantan&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,641&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (&lt;a href=&quot;https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. &lt;/p&gt;

We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &amp;gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter’s mission with Perseverance has been extended</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Ingenuity helicopter proved it could fly on Mars. Now it has loftier goals. Having passed all its original engineering tests, the tiny spacecraft will now begin a new job, supporting the Perseverance rover in its science mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like Ingenuity is graduating,” said Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in a news briefing on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The helicopter arrived at Mars with two main goals: demonstrate that flight was possible on the Red Planet and show that it could return critical flight data to Earth. Those were both achieved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover&quot;&gt;Ingenuity’s first flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 19 and then surpassed as the helicopter flew farther, higher and faster on April 22 and April 25 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/19/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The original plan was for Ingenuity to take up to six flights total, then ground itself forever as Perseverance drove away to do science. That was partly because the Perseverance team expected to drive far from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-audio&quot;&gt;rover’s landing site&lt;/a&gt; in search of rocks that might preserve signs of past Martian life (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We thought we would be doing an intensive drive campaign in which the helicopter would not be able to keep up,” said Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in the briefing. “But based on the rocks we have seen in the area, we really wish to spend a considerable amount of time where we are.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity has also been performing surprisingly well, Aung said. The rover and the helicopter might be able to communicate from more than a kilometer apart, giving them both more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity took its fourth flight on April 30 to scout for a new launch pad. The fifth flight, to be scheduled after the team has examined the data, will be a one-way journey to that new home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, Ingenuity will switch into support mode. Up until now, the Perseverance team has generously supported the helicopter, Aung said. “The rover is primary going forward,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The helicopter will have future flights in support mode. The team says Ingenuity will scout potential scientific observations and rover routes from the sky, make 3-D digital elevation maps and take a look at places a rover can’t go. “The lessons learned from that exercise will benefit future missions with aerial platforms tremendously,” Aung said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team isn’t sure how the helicopter’s mission will end. Ingenuity was designed to last just 30 Martian days. The new support phase will extend its mission by another 30 days, unless something goes wrong before then. “We don’t know how many freeze and thaw cycles it can go through before something breaks,” said Ingenuity chief engineer Bob Balaram.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not possible to reliably predict the emotions someone is experiencing based just on their facial expressions. &lt;/strong&gt;And yet tech companies are trying to do just that. At &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/artificial-intelligence-misreading-human-emotion/618696/&quot;&gt;Kate Crawford explores some of these attempts&lt;/a&gt; — and the contested research on which they are based.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41955&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/covid-19-brain-fog-inspires-search-causes-and-treatments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly Servick takes a look at&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; attempts to understand and treat the “brain fog” experienced by some COVID-19 survivors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short sessions of unconscious bias training are unlikely to produce any long-term changes in the workplace. &lt;/strong&gt;But many researchers believe that we’ve been too quick to simply dismiss these courses, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/25/what-unconscious-bias-training-gets-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;: instead, we should understand what they get wrong and what they get right, and use this knowledge to develop better solutions for combating bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is free will an illusion? Does it even matter? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/27/the-clockwork-universe-is-free-will-an-illusion&quot;&gt;Oliver Burkeman explores&lt;/a&gt; what philosophy, psychology and neuroscience have to say in a long read at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have developed a method to predict whether a psychedelic compound will produce hallucinations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01156-y&quot;&gt;reports Ariana Remmel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The technique involves using a fluorescent sensor to determine exactly how the molecule will bind to a particular serotonin receptor in the brain. The method could be useful for finding non-hallucinogenic psychedelics for the treatment of mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the pandemic affected those living with obsessive compulsive disorder?&lt;/strong&gt; Although early on some researchers were worried that public health measures like hand washing could make certain symptoms worse, the data suggests that that’s not the case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/no-ocd-in-a-pandemic-doesnt-necessarily-get-worse-with-all-that-extra-hand-washing-157961&quot;&gt;write Carey Wilson and Thibault Renoid&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. However, the pandemic may have increased general feelings of anxiety and stress among some people with OCD, similar to effects on people with other mental health conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the Association of British Science is holding an &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.absw.org.uk/events/19-don-t-be-fooled-going-beyond-face-value-in-psychology&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;online event with psychologist Lisa DeBruine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May&lt;/strong&gt;.

	<title>Science News: Little Foot’s shoulders hint at how a human-chimp common ancestor climbed</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/little-foot-hominid-skeleton-shoulder-human-chimp-ancestor-climb</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Little Foot, a nearly complete hominid skeleton painstakingly excavated from rock inside a South African cave, shouldered a powerful evolutionary load.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This 3.67-million-year-old adult female sports the oldest and most complete set of shoulder blades and collarbones of any ancient hominid. Those fossils also provide the best available model for what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724842100035X&quot;&gt;shoulders of the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt; looked like, say Kristian Carlson, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his colleagues. Their results provide new insights into how both Little Foot and a human-chimp last common ancestor climbed in trees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Little Foot belonged to the &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; genus, but her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/little-foot-skeleton-analysis-reignites-debate-over-hominid-species&quot;&gt;species identity is in dispute&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/12/18&lt;/em&gt;). The shape and orientation of her shoulder bones fall between corresponding measures for humans and present-day African apes, but most closely align with gorillas, Carlson reported April 27 at the virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. His talk was based on a paper published online April 20 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Little Foot lived roughly half-way between modern times and the estimated age of a human-chimp common ancestor, says paleobiologist David Green of Campbell University in Buies Creek, N.C., a member of Carlson’s team. If that ancient ancestral creature was about the size of a chimp, as many researchers suspect, shoulders resembling those of gorillas would have supported slow but competent climbing, Green says. Gorillas spend much of the time knuckle-walking on the ground. These apes climb trees with all four limbs, reaching up with powerful shoulders and arms to pull themselves along.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The maintenance of a gorilla-like shoulder in Little Foot offers clues that climbing remained vital for early [hominids],” Green says. It’s possible, he added, that Little Foot’s shoulder design represented “evolutionary baggage” among hominids evolving bodies more suited to upright walking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;digital reconstruction of Little Foot's shoulder bones&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099232&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042821_BB_little-foot_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099232&quot;&gt;Researchers used a digital reconstruction of Little Foot’s nearly complete right shoulder blade, shown here, to determine that this ancient hominid climbed more like gorillas than like chimps, orangutans or humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099232&quot;&gt;K. Carlson &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new analysis makes Little Foot’s shoulders “our best candidate for hypothesizing the appearance of the human-chimp last common ancestor,” says anatomist Susan Larson of Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New York, who wasn’t involved in the research. Ancestral shoulders that supported capable tree climbing would have provided a foundation for the evolution of human shoulders aligned with a two-legged stride and chimp shoulders designed for hanging and swinging from tree branches, she suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, a digital, 3-D reconstruction of Little Foot’s more complete right shoulder blade was compared with right shoulder blades of chimps, gorillas, orangutans and present-day people. Further comparisons were made with partial shoulder blades of 11 ancient hominids. Those hominids included four South African &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; specimens and East African finds from two members of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shoulder-fossil-may-put-lucys-kind-tree&quot;&gt;Lucy’s species&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, that date to around 3.3 million and 3.6 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/25/12&lt;/em&gt;). Little Foot’s collarbones were compared with those of humans, chimps, gorillas, orangutans and seven ancient hominids.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Carlson’s analysis provides preliminary but still uncertain evidence that Little Foot had the most gorilla-like shoulders of any ancient hominid, says paleoanthropologist Stephanie Melillo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Melillo, who did not participate in the new study, considers it most striking that Little Foot shares many shoulder similarities with the other &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; fossils studied by Carlson’s team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers consider a 4.4-million-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolutions-bad-girl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt; skeleton, dubbed Ardi&lt;/a&gt;, the best hominid model for a human-chimp last common ancestor (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/31/09&lt;/em&gt;). Ardi could have moved slowly in trees while holding onto branches above her head, in a manner unlike any modern ape, they contend. But Ardi’s remains lack shoulder blades and collarbones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: news: Announcing the first OA book funded entirely by library membership programme ‘Opening the Future’</title>
	<link>https://ceup.openingthefuture.net/news/4/</link>
	<content:encoded>Roll out of first open access books fully funded by Opening the Future

We're thrilled to announce that our Opening the Future library membership programme has reached the threshold needed to begin funding the first titles in open access.

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

More Information

	<title>Science News: Wild donkeys and horses engineer water holes that help other species</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-donkeys-horses-ecosystem-engineer-water-holes-invasive-species</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Water drives the rhythms of desert life, but animals aren’t always helpless against the whims of weather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the American Southwest, wild donkeys and horses often dig into the dusty sediment to reach cool, crystal clear groundwater to quench their thirst. New research shows this equid ingenuity has far reaching benefits for the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equid wells can act as desert oases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abd6775&quot;&gt;providing a major source of water during dry times&lt;/a&gt; that benefits a whole host of desert animals and keystone trees, researchers report in the April 30 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Introduced to North America in the last 500 years or so, wild donkeys and horses are often cast as villains in the West. These species can trample native vegetation, erode creek beds and outcompete native animals. But when Erick Lundgren, a field ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, first observed wild donkeys digging wells in 2014, he wondered whether these holes might benefit ecosystems, similar to the way elephant-built water holes can sustain a community in the African savanna.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a doe and fawn leaning down to drink water out of a hole in the ground&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099258&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042921_jl_donkey_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099258&quot;&gt;Wells dug by wild donkeys and horses are used by numerous other species. A camera trap caught this doe and fawn mule deer drinking from a donkey well in the Sonoran Desert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099258&quot;&gt;E. Lundgren&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because of the way we value [feral] horses and donkeys, the orthodoxy tends to focus on how they harm ecosystems,” he says. “We wanted to see whether these holes provided a resource when water is scarce.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, Lundgren and his colleagues had to see whether these holes actually increase accessible water. Over the course of three summers from 2015 to 2018, they mapped out the surface area of water in wells and groundwater-fed streams at four sites in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Water availability was highly variable among sites, but equid wells generally increased accessible water, especially as temperatures rose. At one site, wells were the only source of drinking water once the stream completely dried up. Elsewhere, wells provided up to 74 percent of available surface water. Wells also decreased the distance between water sources by an average of 843 meters, making this essential resource more accessible and easing tensions that can escalate among drinkers at isolated water holes, Lundgren says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once wells were dug, other animals came. In droves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers set up cameras at five sites in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, staking out wells, riverbanks and dry spots. They documented 57 vertebrate species, from migratory songbirds to mountain lions, slurping at the wells, which is about equal to the number of species seen at streams and 64 percent higher than dry spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We even caught a black bear drinking from a well,” says Lundgren, who also takes swigs from the wells from time to time. “The water is quite cool, and cleaner than other sources.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a photo of a small tree growing in a hole&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099259&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042921_jl_donkey_inline2-333x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099259&quot;&gt;Donkey wells can act as nurseries for tree seedlings by providing easier access to water away from the competition of established plants on the riverbank. Here, a several-year-old cottonwood grows from an abandoned donkey well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099259&quot;&gt;© Michael Lundgren&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wells can also be nurseries for cottonwood seedlings that require moist, open areas to grow. These fast-growing seedlings struggle to break through the vegetation-stuffed riverbanks, and instead rely on floods for their first sips of water. But at one site, researchers found seedlings thriving in equid holes. Many survived the summer, growing as tall as 2 meters. In areas where dams reduce flooding, equid wells could be fulfilling an important ecosystem service for these iconic tree species, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study “clearly shows that equids can alter these ecosystems in ways that can benefit other species,” says Clive Jones, an ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., who wasn’t involved in the study. Such hydrological engineering isn’t unheard of — beavers, for example, have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beavers-are-engineering-new-alaskan-tundra&quot;&gt;outsized ability to engineer ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/28/18)&lt;/em&gt;. Whether equid wells play a similarly crucial role remains to be seen, Jones says. “More data is needed to say exactly how important wells are in terms of the functioning of these ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the benefits of wells are clear in this study, it’s too early to conclude that feral donkeys and horses are good for ecosystems, notes Jeffrey Beck, a restoration ecologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole body of research documenting the detrimental effects these animals can have on drylands around the world,” Beck says. In Wyoming’s Red Desert, for instance, he’s studied how wild horses often drive antelope-like pronghorn from watering holes. Additionally, “the benefits [the equids] demonstrate in this study might be limited to this area,” he says, since surface water in other areas may not be as accessible by digging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers hope this study can chip away at the notion that introduced species are wholly bad for ecosystems. In some areas, feral equids “are being killed by the hundreds of thousands in the name of purifying nature,” says study author Arian Wallach, an ecologist at the University of Technology, Sydney. To her, this study shows “donkeys [and horses] are part of nature too,” and that eradication efforts might ripple throughout an ecosystem in unforeseen and unfortunate ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Lightning may be an important source of air-cleaning chemicals</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lightning-storm-chemicals-air-clean-atmosphere-pollution</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lightning could play an important role in flushing pollutants out of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observations from a storm-chasing airplane reveal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abg0492&quot;&gt;lightning can forge lots of air-cleansing chemicals&lt;/a&gt; called oxidants, researchers report online April 29 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Oxidants help clear the air by reacting with contaminants like methane to form molecules that are more water soluble or stickier, allowing them to more easily rain out of Earth’s atmosphere or stick to its surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers knew lightning produces nitric oxide, which can lead to the formation of oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals. But no one had seen lightning directly create lots of these oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May and June 2012, a NASA jet measured two oxidants in storm clouds over Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. One was the hydroxyl radical, OH. The other was a similar oxidant called the hydroperoxyl radical, HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The combined concentration of OH and HO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;molecules, generated by lightning and other electrified regions of air, reached up to thousands of parts per trillion in some parts of these clouds. The highest concentration of OH previously observed in the atmosphere was a few parts per trillion. The most HO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;observed was about 150 parts per trillion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t expect to see any of this,” says William Brune, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University. “We shelved the data … because it was just so extreme.” But lab experiments later showed that electricity really could generate such large quantities of OH and HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, helping confirm these oxidant signals were real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 1,800 lightning storms are thought to be raging around the world at any given moment, so Brune and colleagues came up with a ballpark estimate that lightning could account for 2 percent to 16 percent of atmospheric OH. A more precise estimate would require observing more thunderclouds. Understanding how lightning affects atmospheric chemistry could become more important as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-lightning-climate-change-global-warming&quot;&gt;climate change sparks more lightning&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/6/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Mantis shrimp start practicing their punches at just 9 days old</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mantis-shrimp-punch-fastest-baby-larva-video</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fastest punches in the animal kingdom probably belong to mantis shrimp — and they may begin unleashing these attacks a little more than a week after hatching, when they have just started to hunt prey, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have peered through the transparent exoskeletons of these young mantis shrimp to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/224/8/jeb235465&quot;&gt;the inner mechanisms of their powerful weapons in motion&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online April 29 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Biology&lt;/em&gt;. The findings are letting scientists in on hidden details of how these speedy armaments work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mantis shrimp are equipped with special pairs of arms that can explode with bulletlike accelerations to strike at speeds of up to roughly 110 kilometers per hour. Previously, scientists deduced these weapons act much like crossbows. As a latch holds each arm in place, muscles within the arm contract, storing energy within the arm’s hinge. When the crustaceans release these latches, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-these-tiny-insect-larvae-leap-without-legs&quot;&gt;all this energy discharges at once&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/8/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But researchers didn’t know at what age mantis shrimp first begin launching these spring-loaded attacks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/eaao1082&quot;&gt;Computer simulations&lt;/a&gt; predicted that the armaments might be capable of greater accelerations the smaller they got, suggesting young mantis shrimp could actually have faster weapons than adults, says Jacob Harrison, a marine biologist at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To solve this mystery, Harrison and his colleagues collected a host of microscopic creatures off boat docks in Oahu, Hawaii, sifting out larvae of Philippine mantis shrimp (&lt;em&gt;Gonodactylaceus falcatus&lt;/em&gt;) roughly the size of rice grains. They then glued the larvae onto toothpicks to record their punches in high-speed video. The researchers also captured a clutch of eggs from the species and raised the hatchlings for 28 days to see how the anatomy of their weaponry developed over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A larval mantis shrimp (&lt;em&gt;Gonodactylaceus falcatus&lt;/em&gt;) — filmed at 2,000 frames per second and played back at 3 percent speed — retracts and locks its attack arm to store energy before releasing a strike. New research shows these larvae begin unleashing their punches by the time they are 9 days old.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As soon as nine days after hatching, the larvae began striking rapidly. Their punches flew out at speeds of about 1.4 kilometers per hour. Given their tiny arms — up to about 100 times shorter than an adult’s — that’s comparable to the speed of an adult shrimp’s punch, Harrison says. More importantly, it’s up to 10 times the swimming speeds of crustaceans and fish roughly as big as the larvae, and more than 150 times those of young brine shrimp that the researchers fed them. These weapons emerged about when the mantis shrimp larvae first begin feeding on live prey, after exhausting the yolk sacs they were born with, Harrison says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mantis shrimp larvae are capable of moving incredibly quickly for something so small,” Harrison says. “It is hard for small things to move quickly — their muscles and body are so tiny, there isn’t really the time or space to build up speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;black and white image of a mantis shrimp larva&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099253&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042821_CQC_baby-shrimp_feat.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099253&quot;&gt;At 11 days old, this mantis shrimp (&lt;em&gt;Gonodactylaceus falcatus&lt;/em&gt;) larva has already developed an appendage (folded below the eye) capable of ultrafast punches previously seen only in adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099253&quot;&gt;Jacob Harrison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mantis shrimp may need these speedy limbs when they are young “because of the water they live in,” Harrison says. Water feels more viscous for tiny creatures than it does for larger ones, so moving through it can prove challenging for microscopic larvae. However, their powerful appendages may overcome this drag to capture prey, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what the researchers expected, the larvae were not faster than the adults. For instance, during punches, the larvae swiveled their arms at speeds roughly a third to half those of adult peacock mantis shrimp. These findings suggest there may be some constraints on these weapons at these microscopic sizes that further research can uncover, Harrison says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the larvae may simply not require weapons faster than those of adults — “they just need a crossbow that works, and don’t need it to be this crazy superpowerful thing,” says invertebrate neuroecologist Kate Feller at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who did not take part in this research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most amazing part of this work, Harrison says, was how he and his colleagues could peer inside the glassy bodies of the larvae to watch how the muscles behaved during a punch, something previously only imagined from surgical dissections and CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact these larvae are transparent is a great opportunity to answer questions like how the latch works,” Feller says. “That’s very exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: The importance of early career researchers for promoting open research</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JdJdcrkMka4/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS’ Director of Open Research Solutions&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers – as found in PLOS research released as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt; preprint this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of March 2021 &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal’s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large – determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal’s community of editors and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;more than 40%&lt;/a&gt; of papers published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology &lt;/em&gt;voluntarily shared their code already, &lt;em&gt;requiring&lt;/em&gt; more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What proportion of researchers’ papers generate code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What concerns do they have about code sharing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How common are these concerns?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much would submissions to the journal be affected?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;survey dataset&lt;/a&gt; that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;released as a preprin&lt;/a&gt;t. As well as supporting the journal’s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing – relative to other open research practices such as data sharing – and researchers’ experiences with sharing code and software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which — at least in principle — would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns — a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents’ previous publications could have shared code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18885&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;1006&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Respondents were asked “If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18886&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/&quot;&gt;what we discovered about researchers’ needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers’ code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal’s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility – and ultimately reuse – of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and survey dataset &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Please note our results have not yet been peer reviewed, but will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless,” wrote Leo Tolstoy in &lt;em&gt;A Confession&lt;/em&gt;, a succinct summing up of the nihilist worldview. Depressing as it may be, nihilism seems to be on the rise, with the importance of finding a meaningful worldview &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0027408&quot;&gt;steadily decreasing&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do other people &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; nihilists? This is the question posed by Matthew J. Scott and Adam B. Cohen of Arizona State University &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;in a new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. They find that stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative — and unlike stereotypes about atheists, people don’t seem to have any positive views about nihilists at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41939&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 464 participants viewed a short profile of either a fictitious man or woman, containing a picture and some information including occupation, favourite foods, hobbies, and preference for cats or dogs. The profile also outlined the person’s “pet philosophy”: they either had a nihilistic outlook (“We are here because of random events. Our lives have no purpose”) or a meaningful outlook (“We are all here for a reason. All of our lives serve a purpose”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated how much the person embodied certain traits: the Big Five personality traits, “folk social value traits” which included “fun”, “energetic”, “educated”, and “trustworthy”, and the ability to fulfil social tasks including self-protection, being a good friend, attracting romantic partners, caring for family, and being interested in having children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Profiles that indicated life had a purpose were rated as more agreeable, conscientious, outgoing, and open-minded than nihilist profiles, which were in turn considered more neurotic. Similarly, the folk social value traits were all more closely associated with meaningful profiles than they were with nihilist profiles. Nihilists were also considered less competent in all social tasks except for self-protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found that participants viewed nihilists as less religious, more depressed, and less likely to plan for the future — and that these perceptions could go some way to explaining why they had more negative views of nihilists than of those with a more meaningful outlook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study, involving 312 undergraduate participants, replicated the first, and came to many of the same conclusions. This time, the team also found that people had negative views of nihilists no matter what their own beliefs were on the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In three final studies, instead of using profiles of people who were or weren’t nihilists, the team showed participants profiles of people who were described as religious or non-religious, depressed or happy, or good or bad at future planning. Each of these factors was associated with negative judgements: among other findings, non-religious profiles were considered less socially competent and less conscientious; depressed profiles were seen as less extraverted and agreeable, and less able to avoid disease, attract romantic partners and look after children; and those with lower levels of future-planning were seen as less conscientious, less virtuous, and less intelligent, and less likely to be able to care for themselves and others. Together, the results of the final studies suggests that these three factors are indeed the key reason nihilists are negatively stereotyped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results don’t paint a rosy picture when it comes to views of nihilists. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/01/americans-simultaneously-hold-both-positive-and-negative-stereotypes-about-atheists/&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; on atheism, which found both positive and negative stereotypes of the non-religious, there also seems to be very little upside to the results — compared to people who think life has meaning, nihilists were viewed more negatively across the board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at different kinds of nihilism might produce different results, however — the team uses the example of someone who finds the accumulation of wealth meaningless, which may come with more positive stereotypes. It’s also perfectly possible that someone might believe life itself has no inherent purpose but has nonetheless developed their own sense of meaning. Looking more closely at people’s personal webs of meaning may reveal more nuanced attitudes, challenging broader stereotypes of how a “nihilist” thinks, feels, and behaves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;Stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An increasing volume of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accounts for the majority of recent surges in the global NCD burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, increasing humanitarian crises in LMICs have resulted in the global forced displacement of people reaching record highs, with the average length of displacement now greater than 20 years. Until recently, the problem of NCDs in conflict-affected populations was largely neglected. However, with growing awareness of the challenges NCDs represent in humanitarian settings, clinical guidance has been developed for chronic NCD care in LMICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/em&gt; (MSF)&lt;/a&gt; has supported the Jordanian health system by providing multidisciplinary, primary level NCD care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians living in Irbid, Jordan. This week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06333-3&quot;&gt;Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;describe their experiences with MSF, adapting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.re-aim.org/about/what-is-re-aim/&quot;&gt;RE-AIM framework&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate MSF’s program of NCD care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE-AIM is a framework consisting of five elements, &lt;em&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;. The framework was originally developed to encourage program planners, evaluators, funders, and policy-makers to be more attentive to essential program elements, to improve sustainable adoption, and promote the implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions. In this study, through the use of mixed methods, Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; examined the RE-AIM five key elements of the MSF Syrian refugee NCD program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12355&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12355 size-full&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/RE-AIM_resized-e1619620846606.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00143/full&quot;&gt;Ory &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most areas of the program were viewed as acceptable to patients, staff, and stakeholders. Although the care was free, patients were burdened with indirect costs, like paying for transport, to attend clinics, potentially outweighing the benefits of ‘free’ care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program achieved good clinical outcomes for treating patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, more research in the future that uses longer follow-up periods is needed to understand the prevalence or outcomes of major complications of NCDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for implementation was the impact of Syrian patients’ experiences of war, loss, and social suffering on their engagement with NCD care. Staff also shared concerns that they could not manage medical problems in isolation from the psychosocial issues patients faced and they felt ill-equipped to handle patients’ war-related trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients and staff also reported that the referral pathways for specialist services were troublesome and confusing. Funding for specialist referral pathways was limited, even though MSF managed to secure additional funding. This highlights the need for future programs to securely implement specialist referral pathways, ensuring they are designed to be affordable and accessible from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for maintaining the program was cost. High costs were partly responsible for the program’s limited coverage and scope. However, there is room for adaptations. For example, MSF introduced nurse task sharing, which could lead to cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge here is the availability of highly qualified family medicine specialists, for the management of patients with complex needs. While MSF had access to a large number of highly qualified Jordanian staff on this occasion, this is often not the case in all humanitarian crisis settings. This issue is difficult to address, but the authors propose potential workarounds, like telemedicine, as a possible solution for future programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12357 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-_unsplash_strip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in humanitarian crisis settings is extremely difficult. Not only do governments and humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in effectively tackling NCDs in LMICs, but the evaluation of interventions in humanitarian settings is equally as challenging. Still, this study demonstrated that RE-AIM is a valuable tool to guide complex interventions in humanitarian crisis settings. Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; bridge a knowledge gap in the delivery of care in humanitarian settings, however, more research is urgently needed to strengthen responses to NCDs in humanitarian crisis settings. Future programs need to focus on simplifying care models, reducing costs, and harnessing telehealth resources.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A clock’s accuracy may be tied to the entropy it creates</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clock-time-accuracy-entropy-disorder</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today’s most advanced clocks keep time with an incredibly precise rhythm. But a new experiment suggests that clocks’ precision comes at a price: entropy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entropy, or disorder, is created each time a clock ticks. Now, scientists have measured the entropy generated by a clock that can be run at varying levels of accuracy. The more accurate the clock’s ticks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/20079K7fGb41fc0c851061651bfded6801b0de3e0&quot;&gt;the more entropy it emitted&lt;/a&gt;, physicists report in a paper accepted to &lt;em&gt;Physical Review X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you want a better clock, you have to pay for it,” says physicist Natalia Ares of the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time and entropy are closely intertwined concepts. Entropy is known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arrow-time&quot;&gt;arrow of time&lt;/a&gt;,” because entropy tends to grow as time passes — the universe seems to consistently move from lower entropy to higher entropy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/15&lt;/em&gt;). This march toward increasing entropy explains why some processes can proceed forward in time but not in reverse: It’s easy to mix cream into coffee but exceedingly difficult to separate it again. Machines also increase disorder as they operate, for example by giving off heat that boosts the entropy of their surroundings. That means even a standard, battery-powered clock produces entropy as it ticks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Physicists had previously calculated that, for tiny quantum clocks, there’s a direct relationship between the maximum possible accuracy of their ticks and the amount of entropy emitted. But larger clocks are too complex for such calculations. So it wasn’t clear if such a rule held for other types of clocks, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test how much entropy was released in the ticking of a simplified clock, Ares and colleagues made a clock from a thin membrane, tens of nanometers thick and 1.5 millimeters long, suspended across two posts. An electrical signal sent into the clock jostled the membrane, causing it to flex up and down. This bending motion repeated at regular intervals, like the steady ticks of a clock, and an antenna registered that motion. The more powerful the electrical signal was, the more accurately the clock ticked. And as the clock’s accuracy increased, the entropy — a result of heat produced in the antenna’s circuit — increased in lockstep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That result suggests that the theoretical relationship for quantum clocks also applies to other types of clocks. “It’s nice to have that,” says physicist Juan Parrondo of the Complutense University of Madrid, who was not involved with the study. “What I’m not so sure of is how universal is this type of relationship that they find.” The researchers studied only one variety of clock. It’s not yet clear whether the relationship between accuracy and entropy applies to clocks more generally, Parrondo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some scientists suspect the relationship may be universal, revealing a fundamental aspect of how clocks function. The new study “would push us even more in this direction,” says quantum physicist Ralph Silva of ETH Zurich, who was not involved with the research. “It’s a data point in favor that it’s probably the case for all clocks. But that’s not been proven.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order for a clock to operate reliably, it must undergo a process that has a preferred direction in time. If the clock didn’t create entropy, it would be just as likely to run forward as backward. And the more entropy the clock creates, the less likely it is that the clockwork will suffer from fluctuations — temporary backward steps that would degrade its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if the accuracy of all clocks does come at a cost of increased entropy, that trade-off may reflect a close link between the passage of time and its measurement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper &quot;Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Passion Is Linked To Greater Academic Achievement — But In Some Cultures More Than Others</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/28/passion-is-linked-to-greater-academic-achievement-but-in-some-cultures-more-than-others/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Passion” is a word that often crops up on job descriptions and in interviews; articles proliferate online explaining how to adequately express your passion to potential employers. On the whole, passionate people — those who have a strong interest in a particular topic, who are confident in themselves and who dedicate themselves to what they’re doing — are thought of in a positive light, and considered likely to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to predicting achievement, how important is passion really? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;According to Xingyu Li from Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, writing in&lt;em&gt; PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, passion may be less important in certain cultures — and the fact that passion is often seen as the key to achievement may reflect a “distinctly Western model of motivation”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41921&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chief factor explored in the study was how individualistic a society was: in individualistic cultures, the team argues, people are more motivated by pursuing paths related to their passions, while those in collectivistic cultures are more likely to see themselves as part of an interdependent network, often fulfilling obligations to others rather than focusing on their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from a large international survey focusing on education, which included over 1.2 million participants from nearly sixty different countries. The survey measured academic achievement in maths, science and reading during several closed-book tests, and the team also examined the individualism or collectivism of each culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passion itself is hard to measure across cultures — some participant languages, including Mandarin, have no direct translation for the word as understood in the Western world. Instead, passion was measured through self-report answers on various different factors: passionate students were those who were strongly and independently motivated and who showed high levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In science subjects, passion &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;positively correlated with academic achievement: those with higher levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy also had higher test scores. But the strength of this correlation wasn’t the same across cultures: those in individualistic societies such as the US, Australia, and the UK showed a stronger link between passion and achievement than did those in more collectivistic societies such as Colombia or Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results were also mirrored in achievement in both mathematics and in reading — again, high-achieving participants from more individualistic societies were also more likely to have high levels of passion, whilst high-achieving participants from collectivistic societies were not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to check whether any other cultural differences could predict the link between passion and achievement, the team also looked at eight further factors that vary between cultures, including how likely people are to avoid uncertainty, whether they value simple survival over self-expression, and how indulgent they are. However, only differences in individualism vs. collectivism could explain the association between passion and achievement across cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from the results that passion isn’t the only thing that motivates people to achieve their goals — indeed, the team also found that parental support was a crucial factor in achievement in collectivistic societies. And these findings could help with the development of educational support programmes that cater to a wider range of individuals. Rather than developing support that focuses solely on self-regulation and passion, for example, institutions could take a wider view of what motivates students to do well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that one type of motivation is no better than another. Although motivation from others could be seen as more extrinsic, the team writes, it “need not feel like coercive pressure from the outside”: rather than feeling overbearing, such motivation can be a source of “empowerment, persistence and resilience”. While for many students passion is key, it’s certainly worth considering the other factors that might make people tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;Passion matters but not equally everywhere: Predicting achievement from interest, enjoyment, and efficacy in 59 societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior and superior olivary nuclei are distinct in function. The inferior olivary nucleus is typically subdivided into the &lt;em&gt;principal olive, medial accessory olive, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;dorsal accessary olive&lt;/em&gt;, and is thought to play an important role in movement, coordination, and movement-related learning. The superior olivary nucleus consists of the &lt;em&gt;lateral superior olive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;medial superior olive,&lt;/em&gt; as well as a number of surrounding nuclei known as the &lt;em&gt;periolivary nuclei&lt;/em&gt;. The superior olivary nuclei are thought to be involved in hearing, and specifically with identifying the location of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior olivary nuclei receive movement-related information from several sources, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/motor-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This includes information about current movement, body position, muscle tension, and intention. The inferior olivary nuclei use this information to communicate with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; to fine-tune movements and aid in movement-related learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlear&lt;/a&gt; nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior colliculus&lt;/a&gt;, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul MS, M Das J.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731&quot;&gt;Stevenson and Kording&lt;/a&gt; (2011), the authors estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;every 7.4 years, the number of neurons we can record with doubles&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as Moore’s law for brain recordings. Since then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;Stevenson has updated the estimate&lt;/a&gt;, which now stands at 6 years. Could it be that progress itself is accelerating? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218&quot;&gt;Matteo Carandini raised a question&lt;/a&gt;: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change&quot;&gt;a double-exponential curve&lt;/a&gt;: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Doubling times&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; /&gt;image &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot;&gt;CC BY Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662&quot;&gt;Urai et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt; – generously released under a CC-BY license – and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times&quot;&gt;code here&lt;/a&gt;). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It’s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature – 4.5 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7621&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7621&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-8&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;775,554&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8-2/&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=775&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A log-linear model of progress in electrophysiology&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers – hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that’s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can do one better – fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/&quot;&gt;PyMC3&lt;/a&gt; – a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here’s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7617&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7617&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;779,527&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time – and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7619&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7619&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-7&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;752,555&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-7-2/&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=752&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 – of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/&quot;&gt;including Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1&quot;&gt;adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors&lt;/a&gt; to electrophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, this generalized Moore’s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes – but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995&quot;&gt;and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time – perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain’t what it used to be, and it’s coming far faster than we’ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There’s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is – perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:&lt;/p&gt;

These are doubling times are nevertheless shorter than the ones reported previously in the literature so far, so the larger point still stands: the future is happening faster than we thought just a few years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ihstevenson/status/1387439844641628161&quot;&gt;Read the thread here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: To boldly grow: five new journals shaped by Open Science</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FJ2pmGTKCuU/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;PLOS announces new journals&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18866&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;1120&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are extremely excited to announce the imminent launch of &lt;strong&gt;five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;, our first new launches in fourteen years. These new journals are unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges and are rooted in the full values of Open Science:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, before we go on, let’s address this: “Yet more journals?” (Yes, we heard you…!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. We set out, with our original &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/submit/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven journals&lt;/a&gt;, to transform research communication by making research content openly accessible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Over the eighteen years since our first journal launch&lt;/a&gt; we’ve helped prove the viability of Open Access which, despite the occasional disagreement about how best to achieve it, is now a mainstream notion. We changed the publishing landscape via &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, and this new type of “mega-journal” now features at almost every publisher and in every research field. We helped focus the conversation about peer review on rigor and transparency, and more people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions. And, via open data policies, open peer review options, protocols, preregistration, preprint facilitation, etc., we’ve worked towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the &lt;strong&gt;entire research communication process&lt;/strong&gt;, not just our journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that we do not take lightly the responsibility of introducing new journals into the world. While we don’t believe the long-term future of research communication is always going to be the journal as we know it today, we do appreciate the impacts that journals can still have, and the new &lt;strong&gt;communities of practice &lt;/strong&gt;they can empower. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we are launching these five journals in the spirit of them being additional &lt;strong&gt;change-making vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve invited key members of the PLOS Leadership Team along with our CEO, Alison Mudditt, to field specific questions, below: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why launch new journals at this point in PLOS’ journey?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niamh O’Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re a nonprofit, driven by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/dei/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, and we need to adapt to continue to deliver on it. Even though Open Access is now widely adopted, and Open Science is advancing, there are still key voices missing. We are expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers. Researchers have always driven our mission forward, and in order for us to have a meaningful impact we need to include the broadest range of their voices, globally. This way, we ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. These new journals create new and diverse communities of practice, and ensure that they are at the forefront of shaping how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all these journals will be underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. Our existing institutional models are our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing (CAP)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreement&lt;/a&gt; models. We’ll talk more about our brand new models when the journals open for submissions, suffice to say that they are also not based on APCs. With all this said, author fee-based models will still be available for those authors who prefer or need them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are the special characteristics of these new journals?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Shanahan, Publishing Director, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Niamh says, our next phase of work is not just about Open Access. These new journals not only complement and naturally extend the existing PLOS suite of journals, but will hardwire a lens of social responsibility into sharing research. Via these new journals we can work together to address the most pressing ‘Openness’ issue specific to each field, and enable the researchers addressing these challenges, everywhere, to have the broadest impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In full alignment with the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, these titles will ensure diversity and equity of representation at all levels – editors, editorial boards, reviewers, authors – and will actively seek out research from under-represented communities. The journals will play a part in broader efforts to create a more equitable system of knowledge-sharing, accelerating and increasing the benefits of scientific endeavour for global society as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new journals all focus on some of the world’s most globally-relevant issues, to which locally-relevant research can, and must, become more visible. This approach will directly challenge the unfortunate norm that most ‘global’ forums remain dominated by research from Western Europe and North America.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How will these journals contribute to the increased adoption of Open Science practices?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has always led on key Open Science matters, we are experimenters, but we’re also striving to be better listeners. We know a rigid approach to Open Science won’t foster equitable participation from all communities. As a publisher, we’ve never been driven by tradition, but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can understand and improve the system. We’ll continue to investigate and test new ways of sharing, assessing, and recognizing research. We’ll be partnering with leaders across research communities, and the Open Science communities, to enact change. Not every solution will be journal-shaped, but all our journals will be shaped by Open Science, enabling those who publish with us to join communities of practice. We can use our newly expanded journal portfolio to influence norms and advance Open Science practices in considered and appropriate ways. We stand firm on any policies like open data that promote rigor and advance trust in research, but we want to understand the specific challenges that such policies represent for new communities, and work with them to find solutions that empower them, in their contexts, to practice Open Science. Overall, we want to further empower new communities to join us and inform us, working more tightly together towards ever more trust in science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How does this expansion of the portfolio fit into PLOS’ wider aims for the future?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has grown, times have changed, and how we deliver our mission has to evolve. Science is a global, collaborative enterprise. Challenging times help us see where we are and where we need to be. Global collaboration, transparency, and trust in science (and policies…and interventions…)  have all become recurring themes. We’re also coming to terms with how we, as a society, need to do a lot more to address systemic barriers to inclusion. How we think of ourselves as an organization, especially a research communication organization, isn’t separate from everything else going on in the world today. We have always worked to raise the bar for Openness. To continue this work we need to continue to grow – but not just in the traditional business sense, and not just in counting the number of journals we publish: we also need to, and have concrete plans to, spread our roots deeper, create more global hubs for PLOS, absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business, and, as others commented before me, ensure that any journal we publish is informed by local communities at a global scale, challenging problems, and rebuilding the system better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch these spaces!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have Editors in place, we have dedicated staff, and the journals will open for submissions a little later this year. All updated information will appear on the respective journal websites (linked from the list above) as the journals take shape. Visit them often for submission guidelines, how our editorial boards are developing, how to apply to be a member of the board, where to follow them on social media, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Students With ADHD Aren’t Always Given The Support They Need To Thrive At University</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/27/students-with-adhd-arent-always-given-the-support-they-need-to-thrive-at-university/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doing well in educational settings can have huge advantages — better job prospects, higher wages, greater life satisfaction and more. Achievement at university isn’t always to do with how hard you work or how intelligent you are, however — first generation university students are more&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt; at risk of impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reducing their engagement in class, their attendance, and their overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for those with extra needs, university can offer all kinds of extra challenges, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2020.1867990&quot;&gt;as a new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychology&lt;/em&gt; makes clear. It finds that students with ADHD obtained significantly lower grades than those without the diagnosis, suggesting that academic and pastoral services are not going far enough to support neurodiverse students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41888&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 456 US-based students for a longitudinal study: at the first point, students were in their first year of university, with further participation each year for four years. Around half met criteria for ADHD, while the other half did not, and of those who met ADHD criteria half were taking medication. About 70% of students with ADHD and 85% of control participants completed all four assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure ADHD, participants were first asked to complete a self-report scale listing inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly seen in those with the diagnosis. They then took part in a semi-structured interview with the team, designed to explore severity and onset of symptoms, and in an online test designed to measure other potentially significant symptoms such as anxiety or low mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents of the students also filled in a scale indicating their child’s behaviour from the ages of five to twelve and in the six months prior to the study’s start. Using all of this data, a panel of psychologists with expertise in ADHD determined whether each student would be placed in the ADHD or non-ADHD group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the study, the team tracked several factors, including: grades (in the form of GPAs and either reported by the students or taken from university records); progress towards graduation, assessed through how many credits a student had accrued; and whether a student was still enrolled in university. The team also looked at study skills: how well were students engaging in learning strategies like tracking goals, self-testing, or managing their time efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that those in the ADHD cohort overall obtained significantly lower GPAs than those in the control cohort. Students with ADHD symptoms were also less likely to use study skills than their peers, and those who were not taking medication were also more likely to drop out of university altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other factors also had an impact on academic success: those with higher levels of executive functioning, who were more likely to be in the control group, were more likely to obtain higher GPAs and remain in education. Interestingly, those who engaged with university support services were also more likely to achieve academically, suggesting that universities could be doing more to reach those who need help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Helping students with executive functioning — which includes organisation skills, time management, paying attention and self-monitoring — could be one way of supporting them academically. They could also benefit from more support in wider study skills: how to successfully plan, structure, and complete an assignment, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incorporating strategies specifically designed to help neurodiverse students could also be key here. Students with depressive symptoms were also less likely to succeed; including mental health and wider pastoral support is also likely to have a big impact on students with ADHD. Results from the study suggest that isn’t always happening, though. The majority of students with ADHD received no support with academic skills, tailored tutoring or mentoring — only 19.7% received support with academic matters and 34% with tutoring. Universities may need to spend time reaching out to neurodiverse students or those facing other barriers, or risk creating an environment that makes it hard for all to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2020.1867990&quot;&gt;Academic Trajectories of College Students with and without ADHD: Predictors of Four-Year Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: The MDAR Framework – a new tool for life sciences reporting</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1GkvF8JqjjU/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS note:&lt;/strong&gt; We are delighted to share this announcement by the MDAR Working Group &lt;strong&gt;(M&lt;/strong&gt;aterials, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;esign, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalysis, &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eporting)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of a new framework for transparent reporting in the life sciences. PLOS has always put emphasis—through editorial policies and submission guidelines—on complete and transparent reporting to facilitate the analysis, trust, reproduction and reuse of the research we publish. We’ve supported and participated in the MDAR Working Group by sharing our experience and helping to develop and test the new reporting framework. We hope that the MDAR Framework will help bring consistency to journals reporting guidelines and make it easier for authors to adopt transparency norms. The MDAR Framework is consistent with what is practiced at PLOS and we will work with our editorial boards to explore the most effective ways to implement it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incomplete or imprecise reporting of life sciences research contributes to challenges with reproducibility, replicability, and biomedical applications. For the last three years we – a group of journal editors and researchers – have been working together to develop a new framework for transparent reporting of life sciences research. This framework has just been &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118&quot;&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework establishes the four domains – research Materials, Design, Analysis, and Reporting – in which we define both a set of basic minimum requirements, and best practice recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were motivated to develop the MDAR Framework as part of our own and others’ attempts to improve reporting to drive research improvement and ultimately greater trust in science. Existing tools, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;ARRIVE &lt;/a&gt;guidelines, guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/&quot;&gt;FAIRSharing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR Network&lt;/a&gt;, speak to important sub-elements of biomedical research. This new MDAR Framework aims to be  more general and less deep, and therefore complements these important specialist guidelines.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous approaches have led to improved reporting, but often at considerable cost to both authors’ and editors’ time. A recent period of experimentation has resulted in a thorough but fragmented landscape of reporting guidelines for life science journals. A drive for efficiency  inspired us to learn from each other’s experiences and to harmonize the most effective practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework provides flexibility along with broad applicability. The standard articulation of expectations across different journals will make it easier for: (i) authors to better understand what is expected of them, and (ii) for more journals to adopt an established approach rather than develop it from scratch. Journals can choose a level of implementation appropriate to their needs, enabling greater adoption potential. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also hope that the MDAR Framework will be helpful for other organizations such as funders, who can signal reporting expectations early and therefore have an effect at the time the studies are designed, and tool/software developers, who can devise means of facilitating compliance for authors and journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the framework, the project provides a checklist (for authors, journals or reviewers) as an optional implementation tool, and an explanation and elaboration document. The checklist was piloted on over 289 manuscript submissions across 13 journals, seeking feedback from authors and editors actually using the checklist. Our team analysed agreement between observers, sought feedback from outside experts, and revised the framework in the light of this experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full set of MDAR resources will be maintained and updated as a community resource, in a Collection on the Open Science Framework. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are sharing this update on the MDAR Framework through coordinated posts on working group member platforms. Working group members have been free to add any additional context as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How Much Do You Want To Exercise Right Now? Researchers Are Studying People’s In-The-Moment Motivation To Be Active</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/26/how-much-do-you-want-to-exercise-right-now-researchers-are-studying-peoples-in-the-moment-motivation-to-be-active/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think back to the last time that you did some exercise. What exactly prompted you to get up and do it? Was it because it was scheduled? Or because you felt a strong urge to engage in some physical activity (or maybe a bit of both)?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, researchers have explored a person’s general disposition to exercise, and looked at strategies to increase their exercise levels over a week, a month, or longer. However, a team led by Matt Stults-Kolehmainen at Yale University, Yale-New Haven Hospital and Columbia University argues in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.568286/full&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; that it’s also crucial to consider transient changes in in-the-moment wants, desires and urges for physical activity and also rest. “Typically, we understand motivation as a more stable construct – e.g. ‘I am not motivated today’ — or a trait — ‘I am not a motivated person’. This new perspective views motivation &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;,” Stults-Kolehmainen says. And the team believes that by influencing these feelings, people can be encouraged to exercise more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41876&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568390/full&quot;&gt;initial work&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2020, the team explored the concept of considering motivational states for understanding why and when people exercise. In the new paper, they report on their creation of a new scale for assessing these states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their CRAVE (Cravings for Rest and Volitional Energy Expenditures) scale was developed using a series of studies on students and adult participants. The final version includes a total of 10 items that relate to physical activity (a desire to “move my body” or “exert my muscles”, for example) and also being sedentary (for example, a desire to “just sit down” or “do nothing active”.) Results from across the studies showed that these feelings can change rapidly. After a 50-minute lecture, for example, a group of students reported significantly higher in-the-moment “desire to move” scores — and lower ‘”desire to rest” scores — than beforehand; a separate group that was given a gruelling treadmill task showed the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These particular results might not sound surprising — but when it comes to strategies to help people to exercise more, the potential importance of these in-the-moment motivational states has been underestimated, the team thinks. A long period of sitting or a strenuous bout of exercise clearly influences these states, but other things could, too. As the researchers suggest, future studies should explore the potential influence of the time of day, for example, or an individual’s eating patterns. Some influences may also last longer: the team’s two-year study of a community group of adults, reported in the new paper, found that the participants’ in-the-moment motivation to move trended down over this period, while their motivation to rest trended up. “As such, more resources are needed to understand how desires might evolve over an extended period of time (e.g. seasonally, over years) and how they can be intervened upon,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the team hopes to see interventions that trigger or enhance immediate desires to exercise. Stults-Kolehmainen is optimistic about this. He gives this example: “Interestingly, just reading about wants or desires to move and be active might instigate wants/desires to move and be active — and humans are actually capable of perceiving this and, we believe, acting on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personally, I know that anytime I see anyone exercising in a movie (I’m thinking Sarah Connor, say, or even Rocky Balboa), I feel a real urge to exercise, too. If I could time that exposure to a point in the day when exercise was actually practical (rather than when I’m on the sofa with the kids), I could imagine it working to push me up and out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.568286/full&quot;&gt;Measurement of Motivation States for Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior: Development and Validation of the CRAVE Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During the last 13 years of his life, Warhol put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29125003&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thousands of collected objects&lt;/a&gt; into 610 cardboard boxes. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warhol.org/timecapsule/time-capsules/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time Capsules&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were never sold as art, but they were meticulously cataloged by museum archivists and displayed in a major exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242174661/dead-bees-nail-clippings-and-priceless-art-in-warhols-time-capsules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warhol was a packrat&lt;/a&gt;. But that desire to collect helped inform his artistic point of view.” Yet Warhol was aware of his compulsion, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27949117?seq=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disturbed him&lt;/a&gt;: “I'm so sick of the way I live, of all this junk, and always dragging home more.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Where does the hobby of collection cross over into hoarding, and who makes this determination? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Artists get an automatic pass into the realm of collectionism, no matter their level of compulsion. The Vancouver Art Gallery held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140812083317if_/http://couplandexhibition.org/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major exhibition&lt;/a&gt; of the works of Canadian writer and artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://coupland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. One of the sections consisted of a room filled with 5,000 objects collected over 20 years and carefully arranged in a masterwork called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/06/welcome-to-douglas-couplands-brain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Brain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the collection looked like prior to assembly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NxxVGLP_HY4/YIYc8sMgKWI/AAAAAAAANS8/XnbPxcYbkgYMZGvee6UTNH-TKPm1lqyCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s736/Coupland%2527s%2BBrain.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;552&quot; data-original-width=&quot;736&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NxxVGLP_HY4/YIYc8sMgKWI/AAAAAAAANS8/XnbPxcYbkgYMZGvee6UTNH-TKPm1lqyCgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/Coupland%2527s%2BBrain.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials used in the &lt;i&gt;The Brain&lt;/i&gt;, 2000–2014&lt;/b&gt;, mixed-media installation with readymade objects.

Collectors may be passionate, but their obsessions/compulsions do not hinder their everyday function (or personal safety).

They see their collections as adding a new dimension to their lives in terms of providing an area of beauty or historical continuity that might otherwise be lacking.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12853&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;differential diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; for the DSM-5 classification of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519704/table/ch3.t29/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hoarding Disorder&lt;/a&gt; vs. non-pathological Collecting considers order and value of primary importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTjB9ohcFdE/YIYk2P8safI/AAAAAAAANTE/tH5C3J4rWk8fC9M7wlVNWOi2CjpeMOW6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s703/Hoarding%2Bor%2BCollecting%2Bdifferential%2Bdiagnosis.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;558&quot; data-original-width=&quot;703&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTjB9ohcFdE/YIYk2P8safI/AAAAAAAANTE/tH5C3J4rWk8fC9M7wlVNWOi2CjpeMOW6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Hoarding%2Bor%2BCollecting%2Bdifferential%2Bdiagnosis.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fig. 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12853&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nakao &amp;amp; Kanba, 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If possessions are well organized and have a specific value, the owner is deﬁned as a ‘collector.’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Medical conditions that cause secondary hoarding are excluded from Hoarding Disorder.

This process entailed flying across the country five times in a total of 20 different planes in the midst of a pandemic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although my mother showed some elements of  hoarding, she didn't meet clinical criteria. She had various collections of objects (e.g., glass shoes, decorator plates, snuff bottles, and ceremonial masks), but what really stood out were her &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;accumulations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — organized but excessive stockpiles of useful items such as flashlights, slippers, sweatshirts, kitchen towels, and watches (although most of the latter were no longer useful).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s864/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;767&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Ten pairs of unworn gardening gloves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the year+ of COVID sheltering-in-place, some people wrote books, published papers, started nonprofits, engaged in fundraising, held Zoom benefit events, demonstrated for BLM, home-schooled their kids, taught classes, cared for sick household members, mourned the loss of their elder relatives, or endured COVID-19 themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I dealt with the loss of a parent, along with the solo task of emptying 51 years of accumulated belongings from her home. To cope with this sad and lonely and emotionally grueling task, I took photos of my mother's accumulations and collections. It became a mini-obsession unto itself. I tried to make sense of my mother's motivations, but the trauma of her suffering and the specter of an unresolved childhood were too overwhelming. Besides, there's no computational model to explain the differences between Collectors, Accumulators and Hoarders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/compulsive-collecting-of-toy-bullets.html&quot;&gt;Compulsive Collecting of Toy Bullets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/compulsive-collecting-of-televisions.html&quot;&gt;Compulsive Collecting of Televisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/neural-correlates-of-compulsive.html&quot;&gt;The Neural Correlates of Compulsive Hoarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/06/welcome-to-douglas-couplands-brain.html&quot;&gt;Welcome to Douglas Coupland's Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halperin DA, Glick J.

It's a misguided effort when the goal is framed so simplistically (or monolithically).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, whose brain are we trying to explain? Yours? Mine? The brain of a monkey, mouse, marsupial, monotreme, mosquito, or mollusk? Or &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; with its 306 neurons? “Yeah yeah, we get the point,” you say, “stop being so sarcastic and cynical. We're searching for core principles, first principles.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;What does “core principle” mean?&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Pruszynski (@andpru) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andpru/status/1314266663508992017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In response to that tweet, definitions of “core principle” included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Basically: &lt;/span&gt;a formal account of why brains encode information and control behaviour in the way that they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamental theories on the underlying mechanisms of behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Maybe “first principles” would be better?]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set of rules by which neurons work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the problem of explanation. What are we trying to explain? Behavior, of course [&lt;i&gt;a very specific behavior&lt;/i&gt; most of the time]: X behavior in your model organism. But we also want to explain thought, memory, perception, emotion, neurological disorders, mental illnesses, etc. Seems daunting now, eh? Can the same core principles account for all these phenomena across species? I'll step out on a limb here and say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then snort for asking such an unfair question. Best that your research program is broken down into tiny reductionistic chunks. More manageable that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what counts as an “explanation”? We haven't answered that yet. It depends on your goal and your preferred level of analysis (à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Marr's 3 levels of analysis, from 'Vision'&quot;&gt;three levels&lt;/a&gt; of David Marr): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s320/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias&quot;&gt;Krakauer et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, what counts as “explanation”?

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: news: Characterization of an open access medical news platform readership during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
	<link>https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/26666/accepted</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract:  Background:

There now exists many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up-to-date with medical literature. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Objective:

The current study aimed to employ readership and survey data to characterize open access medical news readership trends in relation to COVID-19 in addition to overall readership trends regarding pandemic related information delivery.

Methods:

Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &amp;lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale.

Results:

COVID-19 articles had significantly more median views than non-COVID-19 articles (296 vs. 110, U = 748.5, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average read times or bounce rate. Non-COVID-19 had more median actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs. 2.5, U = 2070.5, P &amp;lt; 0.05). On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), survey data revealed that 66% (78/119) of readers Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID-19 using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine versus direct journal access. A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (71.7%) than direct journal article access (50.8%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated reading one or less full length medical study following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (16.9% vs. 31.8%, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Conclusions:

There is a significantly increased readership in one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic, reinforcing that open-access physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers to stay up to date with medical literature.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study has found that about two-thirds of conversations don’t end when we want them to. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers who monitored over 900 conversations found that most people wanted them to finish sooner, though a minority wanted them to continue for longer. This was true whether participants were talking to someone they had just met or a loved one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22368306/social-awkwardness-conversations-adam-mastroianni&quot;&gt;Adam Mastroianni tells Sean Illing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet more on dolphin psychology this week: dolphins appear to remember the “names” of those who have co-operated with them previously, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/dolphins-learn-names-their-friends-form-teams-first-animal-kingdom&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Morell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to human names, dolphins have signature whistles which are given to them by their mothers. The researchers played recordings of signature whistles to bottlenose dolphins, finding that the marine mammals almost always turned towards the whistle of a dolphin with whom they had an established alliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve written a lot recently about trials into the use of psychedelic drugs to treat depression&lt;/strong&gt;. But what’s the mechanism behind the purported antidepressant effect of these drugs? &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2021/04/how-lsd-might-cure-depression/&quot;&gt;Tom Chivers takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Unherd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers are testing whether a video game used as a treatment for kids with ADHD could help people struggling with memory and attention problems after recovering from COVID-19.&lt;/strong&gt; The game improves people’s ability to do more than one thing at once, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391587/long-covid-brain-cognitive-treatment-video-game-akili&quot;&gt;Faith Gunning tells Nicole Wetsman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which might prove helpful to COVID-19 survivors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although we often hear about the potential risks of certain online communities, they also provide an important source of support. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/yes-online-communities-pose-risks-for-young-people-but-they-are-also-important-sources-of-support-158276&quot;&gt;researcher Benjamin Kaveladze discusses&lt;/a&gt; his work highlighting the sense of support, belonging, and validation which mental health forums can provide to young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;: there have been lots of videos of dogs supposedly “talking” to their owners by pressing certain buttons on a board — but are these animals truly communicating?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/talking-dogs-really-159075&quot;&gt;Mélissa Berthet and Léo Migotti outline the reasons to be sceptical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-warrior-gene-blaming-genetics-for-bad-behavior/&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flint_OUPblog_warrior-gene_image-idea-1-744x286.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent to which we can blame our genes for bad behavior took another step backward recently, in the US at least, with a court ruling that data from the “warrior gene” couldn’t be used as an excuse for diminished responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belief in the existence of a warrior gene has been around for more than 25 years, one of many examples where genetic effects on behavior have been misunderstood. In 1994, Stephen Mobley, convicted of murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm, was sentenced to death. His trial occurred soon after the publication of a paper attributing aggression to a deficiency of MAOA. Supporting this claim were data reporting that eight men from the same family had repeated episodes of aggressive behavior. One had been convicted at the age of 23 of the rape of his sister. Another tried to run over his boss with a car at the sheltered workshop where he was employed after having been told that his work was not up to par. A third would enter his sisters’ bedrooms at night, armed with a knife, and force them to undress. At least two more were known arsonists. Han Brunner, the geneticist in the Netherlands who described this unfortunate family, found evidence that males with criminal behavior had a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which is involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, the last being the target of antidepressants such as Prozac. Since men have only one copy of the gene (one X chromosome), the men with the mutation in MAOA had no functional enzyme. On the face of it, MAOA mutations were making Dr Brunner’s patients aggressive. Mobley filed a motion seeking funds to hire expert witnesses to assess whether he, like the men in the paper, had a deficiency of the MAOA gene, which was later to become famous as the “warrior gene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Mobley’s bad luck that the court threw out his petition, and he was subsequently executed by lethal injection, but news of his defence soon spread. In Ohio in 2000, lawyers for Dion Wayne Sanders tried the MAOA argument, and though the court decided it could not be shown that when Sanders shot both of his grandparents he lacked the specific intent to kill them, the jury returned verdicts of imprisonment rather than the death penalty. And, in a case heard in Tennessee in 2009, with respect to the genetic data, the court found “as a matter of law, that the expert services sought are necessary to ensure that the constitutional rights of the Defendant are properly protected.” So began a saga that has persisted till February 2021, when the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out the “warrior gene” defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and … arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, don’t imagine for a second that this is a death blow for genetic determinism. The court’s decision means that a mutation in a single gene (MAOA) can’t be blamed for violent acts, and since no one has found a mutation in any of the 23,000 other genes in the human genome that causes violence, it’s now pretty certain that there no warrior genes. But there is a possibility that we can blame someone’s genetic constitution in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s become clear over the last decade is that almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and that it arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants. These variants are not mutations that kill a gene or give it a new function. In fact, individually, they don’t do much at all, just increasing or decreasing the likelihood of a behavior by a very small amount (if you think of it as percentage where the warrior gene has a 100% effect, then these variants have an effect less than 0.01%). While individually small, there are so many thousands of them that in total the effect is detectable. Scientists have been getting better and better at predicting behavioral outcomes from aggregate assays of genetic data. This is because genetic data is being harvested on an increasingly large scale; it’s routine to publish results from millions of individuals—one of the best and most productive sources of such data comes from the UK where 500,000 people were recruited into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;UK BioBank&lt;/a&gt;. As datasets grow bigger, the predictive accuracy of genetic data has improved and is being touted in the clinics as a way to diagnose heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other common diseases. It won’t be long before lawyers realize they have a new toy: “don’t blame my client, he couldn’t help himself, it was all in his genes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649872592/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f04%2fFlint_OUPblog_warrior-gene_image-idea-1-744x286.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-if-covid-19-had-emerged-in-1719/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What if COVID-19 had emerged in 1719?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/05/fake-news-is-not-new-russias-19th-century-disinformation-experiment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fake news is not new: Russia’s 19th-century disinformation experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked past a baker’s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?  Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it’s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12348&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/bagel-1434064-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.  These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02618-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Pediatrics: Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12349&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-6165772_1920-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.  Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of “political skill” can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12350&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/politics-2361943_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research.   The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five “thematic dimensions” which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00536-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Psychology: Does walking through a doorway always make you forget?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;doorway effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.  Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12351&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/idea-3338440_1920-300x196.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person’s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Resolving Arguments Can Prevent Bad Feelings From Lingering — And We Get Better At It As We Age</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/22/resolving-arguments-can-prevent-bad-feelings-from-lingering-and-we-get-better-at-it-as-we-age/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Don’t go to bed on an argument” is an adage we’ve all heard and, at some point, probably ignored. Hackneyed as it is, the phrase does have some truth: resolving arguments, rather than letting them simmer away, can make us feel calmer and happier the next day (and also makes it easier to actually get to sleep).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbab006/6076809?login=true#229317336&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Oregon State University’s Dakota D. Witzel and Robert S. Stawski has looked at the benefits of resolving arguments — and the team finds that not only can resolution almost erase the emotional stress associated with a big argument altogether, but that individual differences can affect how well we do it. The older we get, they find, the less we argue and the better we are at dealing with argument-related stress when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41862&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was taken from a daily diary study, in which more than 2,000 participants completed via end-of-day phone interviews over eight days. First, positive and negative affect was measured, with participants indicating how much of the day they had spent feeling particular emotions such as anxiety and cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyday stressors were also recorded, with participants reporting whether or not they had experienced a specific type of negative event within the last twenty four hours. This included not only arguments, but &lt;em&gt;avoided&lt;/em&gt; arguments (“did anything happen that you could have argued about but you decided to let pass in order to avoid a disagreement?”). The team also recorded whether or not these stressors were resolved, as well as how severe the stressor was on a scale from one to three. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arguments were pretty common: 1,355 arguments were recorded over the eight days (9.10% of all days), of which 95% had a severity greater than one. There were also 2,177 avoided arguments, 86% of which also had a severity greater than one. A total of 65% of all arguments were resolved compared to 63% of avoided arguments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, arguments and avoided arguments had a big impact on mood and affect: negative affect was higher and positive affect lower on days with arguments than those without. This negative affect was even higher when disagreements had not been dealt with, with unresolved arguments associated with increased negative affect over the following days. Resolved arguments, on the other hand, did not increase low mood, and also had a “residue effect” — in other words, resolving an argument mitigated the emotional impact for days to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Age played a huge role here. Older participants had a significantly lower number of both arguments and avoided arguments to begin with, and age was also associated with increased likelihood of arguments being resolved — adults aged above 68 were over 40% more likely than people under the age of 45 to report their conflicts as resolved. Older people also saw less of an increase in negative mood after arguments, even if they did go unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what can explain this pattern of results? The first and most obvious answer would be that older people are simply more experienced when it comes to resolving arguments. Handling conflict in relationships is not always easy and may require some practice before getting it right: the older you are, the more practice you’re likely to have. The team also posits that older people are simply more motivated to avoid arguments and that they have more emotional resilience than younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another notable finding from the study is that bad feelings can linger when arguments go unresolved, with a potential impact on health and wellbeing more generally. Developing ways in which people can start to improve their conflict resolution skills could therefore provide wider benefits than just improving relationships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbab006/6076809?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;Resolution Status and Age as Moderators for Interpersonal Everyday Stress and Stressor-Related Affect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper &quot;Bursting Neurons Signal Input Slope&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common
firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they
represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to
determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features
of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells
indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial
arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal
dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a
computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to
investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that
trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives
sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially
on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the
number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a
graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in
terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are
several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur
preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et
al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a
simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our
observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst
duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This
possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for
correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Unmet Sexual Needs Can Leave People Less Satisfied With Their Relationship — But Having A Responsive Partner Mitigates This Effect</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/21/unmet-sexual-needs-can-leave-people-less-satisfied-with-their-relationship-but-having-a-responsive-partner-mitigates-this-effect/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For better or worse, romantic partners usually have to rely heavily on each other to fulfil their sexual needs.” So begins a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-14418-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; that attempts to plug a gap in understanding sexual ideals — and what might buffer against dissatisfaction if reality doesn’t quite match.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sexual incompatibilities are not only common, but are difficult to resolve even with couples therapy, note Rhonda N. Balzarini at York University and colleagues in their paper in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes&lt;/em&gt;. Despite this, there’s been only limited work to understand precisely what constitutes an individual’s ideal sex life. Earlier work has generally focused on narrow aspects, such as how often a person would ideally like to have sex, or on levels of sexual desire. For this new research, the team developed a broader, 30-item Sexual Ideals Scale, which asks about specific behaviours (“My partner engages in oral sex with me as much as I want my ideal partner to”, for example) but also about the importance of feeling safe and in love, or of dirty talk, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41853&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study involved 207 members of mixed-sex couples from Canada and the US who had been in a relationship for at least four months. Both members of each couple took part. As well as the new Sexual Ideals Scale, they independently completed measures of sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, commitment to their partner and also their “sexual communal strength”. Someone high in sexual communal strength is more motivated to meet their partner’s needs “even when those needs are different from their own”. Such a person is likely to be perceived as being more responsive, even if their partner’s sexual ideals aren’t being met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This first study showed, unsurprisingly, that when people report unmet sexual ideals in their relationship, both they and their partner reported lower sexual and relationship satisfaction. However, among those with unmet sexual ideals, people with a sexually communal partner reported higher levels of both types of satisfaction. The results for men and women were very similar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also ran daily diary-based studies, which revealed that on days when people reported having more unmet sexual ideals than typical, both they and their partner reported lower levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction and commitment. There were long-term effects, too: more unmet sexual ideals over a three-week period were associated with reductions in both types of satisfaction for both partners three months later. The results couldn’t be explained by the participants’ reports of sexual frequency or levels of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that people hold ideals about their sexual relationship — and when these ideals are not met, there are negative consequences. However, again, the data suggested that having a sexually communal partner mitigated this. In a final experimental study, the team found that participants who’d been led to believe that their sexual ideals were not being met reported lower levels of both types of satisfaction &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if they rated their partner as low for sexual communal strength, but not if this score was high. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with sexually communal partners may not feel that their sexual ideals are being entirely met, but their partner’s behaviour may make this feel less of a problem, the researchers suggest. Perhaps their partner is supportive when declining their sexual advances, or more willing to compromise, or offer other forms of affection when they’re not interested in sex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interventions aimed at addressing sexual compatibilities are scarce, the team notes. Since the new research suggests that if both members of a couple make more of an effort to be responsive, this could reduce or even overcome relationship difficulties caused by mismatched sexual ideals, this does at least suggest an approach to try. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-14418-001&quot;&gt;The detriments of unmet sexual ideals and buffering effect of sexual communal strength.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Editor’s tips for passing journal checks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/uuA7LujvZ4Y/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You’ve painstakingly mapped out your research goal: to answer that unanswered question. You’ve conducted your experiments, analyzed the results and written your paper. Now it’s off to a journal. And the process begins. PLOS editors have seen it all and want to help get your paper published as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does the journal office look for, and what are the potential pitfalls? More importantly, how can you ensure that your manuscript passes journal checks and moves on to peer review quickly? Here, PLOS staff discuss a few of the most common reasons why a manuscript is rejected during the initial technical check, and how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, after a manuscript is submitted to a scientific journal it undergoes a series of technical and ethical checks. Submissions that pass this initial screening go on to editorial assessment and peer review. Submissions that don’t meet requirements, or don’t provide enough information, may be returned to the authors for clarification. This can extend review times and even lead to a manuscript being rejected without review. Below are 5 checks and tips on how to smoothly get past them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #1: Sense check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, does the manuscript make sense as a submission? Is it a scientific article? Are all the typical parts of an article (abstract, introduction, methods, results/discussion, figures citations) all present? Is the language clear and understandable?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your manuscript is complete, and that the writing is clear and unambiguous. Note that it doesn’t have to be perfect at this stage, just precise enough for fellow researchers in your field to understand and evaluate your work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-edit-your-work/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to editing your work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #2: Journal fit and scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e20e8e3d0d&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Kendall-765x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Journals tend to specialize in particular subjects and types of studies. “The biggest reason we reject without review is scope.” Explains Kendall McKenzie, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt; “&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt;Our scope page&lt;/a&gt; breaks down the diseases and categories of research we’re interested in, and even specifically states the kinds of things we don’t consider.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; It comes down to submitting the right manuscript to the right publication. Carefully investigate the journal’s scope before submitting to ensure that your manuscript has a good chance of publication. If your particular article is on the edge of the journal’s expressed scope, or if you’re just not sure, search the journal for similar articles; if there are no comparable publications, your study is likely out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-choose-journal/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to choosing a journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #3: Acceptance criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2137e3d0e&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Laura-1024x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Laura Simmons, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics &lt;/em&gt;agrees. “In addition to scope, our Editors in Chief and Section Editors may reject without review if a submission is lacking in biological or mechanistic insight (i.e. if it is too descriptive), or if the research doesn’t represent a significant advance in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; This one is all about doing your research. Different journals have different criteria for publication. Consult the journal website and consider whether your study fulfills the requirements and mission of the journal. Does the journal publish the type of research your study describes? Will your article appeal to the readers the journal serves? If not, consider a more specialized publication that focuses specifically on the type of research you are conducting, or, alternatively, a journal with a broader, more inclusive scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #4: Plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2181e3d0f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Emma.jpg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most journals run an automated check that looks for similarities between your manuscript and previously published works. If the manuscript scores above a certain threshold, members of the journal staff will take a closer look at your manuscript to ensure that any direct quotes are framed within quotation marks and properly cited. “Overall the most common issue we see is authors reusing their own methods section, introduction, or conclusion from previous or related studies,” explains &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Publishing Editor Emma Stillings. Authors don’t always realize that “you have to cite everyone, even yourself, to avoid any delay in the peer review process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Any direct quotes &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;be framed within quotation marks and properly attributed. That includes your own prior works. Try to avoid reusing text, and especially copy-pasting from your other papers. Check to make sure that any summaries or allusions are properly cited as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #5: Complete and consistent ethical, funding, data, and other statements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the statements in the submission form are unclear, lacking detail, or otherwise incomplete, the process will pause while the journal office contacts the authors for more information. Similarly, if the statements within the manuscript are different from those in the submission system, the journal office will work with the authors to reconcile them before the manuscript can advance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Label and save the paperwork from the early part of your research process: funding information, committee approval documents, permits, permission forms, patient disclosure statements, study designs, and any other materials. You may need them to complete your submission form. When you are ready to submit, proofread carefully to ensure that everything in your manuscript is up-to-date and clear. Double check to make sure that any placeholder text has been replaced with the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final words of wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Describing Groups To Children Using Generic Language Can Accidentally Teach Them Social Stereotypes</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/20/describing-groups-to-children-using-generic-language-can-accidentally-teach-them-social-stereotypes/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we talk to children about the characteristics of boys and girls, our word choice and syntax can profoundly shape what they take away from the conversation. Even attempts to dispel stereotypes can backfire: as we recently reported, telling kids that girls are “as good as” boys at maths &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;can actually leave them believing that boys are naturally better&lt;/a&gt; at the subject and that girls have to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other work has shown that “generic” language can also perpetuate stereotypes: saying that boys “like to play football”, for instance, can make children believe that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; boys like to play football, or that liking football is a fundamental part of being a boy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953132&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that when kids hear this kind of generic language, they don’t just make assumptions about the group that is mentioned — they also make inferences about &lt;em&gt;unmentioned&lt;/em&gt; groups. That is, if children hear that boys like to play football, they might deduce that girls do not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41838&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To examine these kinds of inferences, Kelsey Moty and Marjorie Rhodes from New York University first asked 287 kids aged 4 to 6 to watch a video about a town that is home to two groups of people: “zarpies” and “gorps”. First, a narrator introduced these groups, outlining a few of their characteristics (zarpies, for instance, “like to climb tall fences”, while gorps “like to draw stars on their knees”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids then saw more zarpies and gorps, while hearing either generic or specific statements about them. A generic statement, for instance, would be “zarpies are good at baking pizza”, while a specific statement would be “this zarpie is good at baking pizza”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participants saw another zarpie and another gorp, and were asked whether each of these were good at baking pizza (or whatever activity the statement had been about).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consistent with past work, kids who had heard the generic statement were more likely than those who had heard the specific statement to infer that the new zarpie was good at baking pizza. But these participants were also more likely to infer that the new gorp was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;good at baking pizza. That is, generic language seemed to lead the children to make assumptions even about members of the unmentioned group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these inferences were made by kids as young as 4-and-a-half. And as the children got older, the more likely they were to make them: almost all 7-year-olds who had heard the generic statement said that the new zarpie was good at baking pizza and that the new gorp was not good at baking pizza (a group of adults also made near unanimous judgements along these lines).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Could it simply be that the children had been shown two apparently contrasting groups, so just assume that a gorp must be the opposite of a zarpie in all ways? A later study suggests that this isn’t the case. In this experiment, the video was presented either by a knowledgeable narrator who lived in the neighbourhood, or an unknowledgeable one who was visiting for the first time.  The children again made inferences about the unmentioned group based on generic statements — but only when the speaker was knowledgeable. This suggests that children actually reason about what a speaker knows and what information they intend to convey, in order to make their inferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then the work suggests that children (like adults) &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;make inferences about unmentioned categories when they hear generic statements — particularly if they think that the speaker knows what they’re talking about. So it’s easy to see how generic language could inadvertently perpetuate gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, the researchers didn’t explicitly test the kids’ beliefs about boys and girls: they used the fictional groups of zarpies and gorps instead, precisely so the kids wouldn’t be influenced by existing stereotypes. But it would still be interesting to know whether children make similar inferences about boys and girls — perhaps researchers could try and minimise the influence of existing stereotypes by using fictional activities instead (for instance, if kids were told that girls were good at “plarping”, what would they think about a boy’s plarping skills?). Still, the study provides yet another striking example of how the way we speak to children shapes their beliefs about social groups.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Opinions Based On Feelings Are Surprisingly Stable</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/19/opinions-based-on-feelings-are-surprisingly-stable/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emotional states can be fleeting and somewhat inexplicable — you can feel great one minute and down in the dumps the next, sometimes for no apparent reason. It follows, then, that opinions based on emotion are likely to be equally fleeting: if you’re in a bad mood when you take part in a survey or review a product, then surely the attitudes measured and recorded will be just as transient too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to a series of studies by Matthew D. Rocklage from the University of Massachusetts Boston and Andrew Luttrell from Ball State University, this isn’t actually the case. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620965532&quot;&gt;they report in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attitudes based in emotion are actually &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; stable: the more emotional an opinion, the less it changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41833&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, participants were asked to think of three gifts they had recently received, before selecting their attitude towards the gift from a list of adjectives, some overtly negative, some overtly positive and some neutral, such as “amazing”, “boring”, “terrifying”, or “valuable”. Participants listed gifts ranging from electric toothbrushes to Star Wars figurines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One month later, participants were asked to think of the same gifts and again select adjectives that represented their feelings about them. After the second part of the study, the adjectives chosen by participants were coded for positive or negative valence, extremity, and emotionality. (Although these may seem similar, emotionality relates to how much an attitude is based on emotion, while extremity measures the extent to which an attitude is positive or negative; “outstanding”, for example, has high emotionality but low extremity.)      &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those participants who chose more extreme adjectives, whether positive or negative, were less likely to see a change in the valence of the adjectives used to describe their gifts at the second time point. Similarly, the more an attitude was based on emotion, the less it changed too. A second study, which looked at attitudes towards brands, also found that emotionally-based attitudes changed less over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third study looked at attitudes in a more naturalistic setting: reviews of products posted online. The team obtained all reviews for all restaurants in Chicago over a period of twelve years, looking only at reviewers who had posted more than one review of the same establishment. The team then analysed both the emotional valence of the reviews and measured any differences in the number of stars the reviewers gave the restaurants at each time point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in previous studies, &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; emotionality consistently predicted less change in attitude across time, though negative emotionality did not. Positive extremity also predicted less change in attitude, while negative extremity predicted more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at whether exposure to messages designed to evoke emotions actually increase the likelihood of people developing fixed attitudes. To do this, the team assigned participants to two conditions. In one, they saw a message about a fictional aquatic animal called the “lemphur” designed to elicit high emotion, reading about a touching underwater encounter between the creature and a diver. In the low emotion condition, participants read a fact-based message about the lemphur similar to an encyclopedia entry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reading the text, participants indicated their attitude towards the animal, selecting from the same list of adjectives used in the first study. In follow-up studies over the next few days, participants selected adjectives again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the high-emotion condition were, unsurprisingly, more likely to indicate a more emotional response to the animal than those in the low-emotion condition, and also had a more &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; response. Those in the high-emotion condition also saw less change in their attitude towards the creature over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, emotional responses were related to more fixed attitudes. Notably, positive emotionality had a particularly strong effect, which may be a useful to know for the creation of public health messaging or other attempts at attitude change — inducing positive emotions, rather than negative emotions like shame, may be more beneficial. Whether positive emotions have a similar effect on actual behaviour, rather than just attitudes, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620965532&quot;&gt;Attitudes Based on Feelings: Fixed or Fleeting?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649494254/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover-Image-744x286.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial killers—people who repeatedly murder others—provoke revulsion but also a certain amount of fascination in the general public. But what can modern psychology and neuroscience tell us about what might be going on inside the head of such individuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial killers characteristically lack empathy for others, coupled with an apparent absence of guilt about their actions. At the same time, many can be superficially charming, allowing them to lure potential victims into their web of destruction. One explanation for such cognitive dissonance is that serial killers are individuals in whom two minds co-exist—one a rational self, able to successfully navigate the intricacies of acceptable social behaviour and even charm and seduce, the other a far more sinister self, capable of the most unspeakable and violent acts against others. This view has been a powerful stimulus in fictional portrayals ranging from &lt;em&gt;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&lt;/em&gt;, to Hitchcock’s &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt;, and a more recent film, &lt;em&gt;Split&lt;/em&gt;. Yet there is little evidence that real-life serial killers suffer from dissociative identity disorder (DID), in which an individual has two or more personalities cohabiting in their mind, apparently unaware of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, DID is a condition more associated with victims, rather than perpetrators, of abuse, who adopt multiple personalities as a way of coming to terms with the horrors they have encountered. Of course a perpetrator of abuse may also be a victim, and many serial killers were abused as children, but in general they appear not to be split personalities, but rather people conscious of their acts. Despite this, there is surely a dichotomy in the minds of such individuals perhaps best personified by US killer Ted Bundy, who was a “charming, handsome, successful individual [yet also] a sadist, necrophile, rapist, and murderer with zero remorse who took pride in his ability to successfully kill and evade capture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a recent brain imaging study … showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between … a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One puzzling aspect of serial killers’ minds is the fact that they appear to lack—or can override—the emotional responses that in other people allows us to identify the pain and suffering of other humans as similar to our own, and empathise with that suffering. A possible explanation of this deficit was identified in a recent brain imaging study. This showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between the amygdala—a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions—and the prefrontal cortex, which interprets responses from the amygdala. When connectivity between these two regions is low, processing of negative stimuli in the amygdala does not translate into any strongly felt negative emotions. This may explain why criminal psychopaths do not feel guilty about their actions, or sad when their victims suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet serial killers also seem to possess an enhanced emotional drive that leads to an urge to hurt and kill other human beings. This apparent contradiction in emotional responses still needs to be explained at a neurological level. At the same time, we should not ignore social influences as important factors in the development of such contradictory impulses. It seems possible that serial killers have somehow learned to view their victims as purely an object to be abused, or even an assembly of unconnected parts. This might explain why some killers have sex with dead victims, or even turn their bodies into objects of utility or decoration, but it does not explain why they seem so driven to hurt and kill their victims. One explanation for the latter phenomenon is that many serial killers are insecure individuals who feel compelled to kill due to a morbid fear of rejection. In many cases, the fear of rejection seems to result from having been abandoned or abused by a parent. Such fear may compel a fledgling serial killer to want to eliminate any objects of their affections. They may come to believe that by destroying the person they desire, they can eliminate the possibility of being abandoned, humiliated, or otherwise hurt, as they were in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial killers also appear to lack a sense of social conscience. Through our parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and other individuals who influence us as we grow up, we learn to distinguish right from wrong. It is this that inhibits us from engaging in anti-social behaviour. Yet serial killers seem to feel they are exempt from the most important social sanction of all—not taking another person’s life. For instance, Richard Ramirez, named the “Night Stalker” by the media, claimed at his trial that &lt;em&gt;“you don’t understand me. You are not expected to. You are not capable of it. I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil … I don’t believe in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this so-called civilized society.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains far from clear why a few people react to abuse or trauma at an earlier stage in their lives by later becoming a serial killer. But hopefully new insights into the psychological or neurological basis of their actions may in the future help us to identify potential future such killers and dissuade them from committing such horrendous crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/vectors/psycho-shower-stabbing-knife-kill-303435/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649494254/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649494254/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2fCover-Image-744x286.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-if-covid-19-had-emerged-in-1719/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What if COVID-19 had emerged in 1719?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-warrior-gene-blaming-genetics-for-bad-behavior/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>xcorr.net: Is early vision like a convolutional neural net?</title>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2021/04/16/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early convolutional neural net (CNNs) architectures like the Neocognitron, LeNet and HMAX were inspired by the brain. But how much like the brain are modern CNNs? I made a pretty strong claim on Twitter a few weeks ago that the early visual processing is nothing like a CNN:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;CNNs are better models of vision than transformers. But you know what's funny? Early vision is nothing like a CNN. There are no mechanisms to tie weights from one neuron to another. Resolution varies with eccentricity. Features maps vary across space. So why do they look similar? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&quot;&gt;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1377685962067746820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In typical Twitter fashion, my statement was a little over-the-top, and it deserved a takedown. What followed was a long thread of replies from Blake Richards, Grace Lindsay, Dileep George, Simon Kornblith, members of Jim DiCarlo’s lab, and even Yann LeCun. The different perspectives are interesting, and I’m curating them here. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My position, in brief, is that weight sharing and feature maps – the defining characteristics of modern CNNs – are crude approximations of the topography of the early visual cortex and its localized connection structure. Whether this distinction matters in practice depends on what you want your models to accomplish – I argue that for naturalistic vision, it can matter a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several defining characteristics of modern CNNs:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selectivity operations (i.e the ReLU)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pooling operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Localized receptive fields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feature maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight sharing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where did these ideas come from?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hubel and Wiesel (1962) described simple and complex cells in the cat primary visual cortex. Simple cells respond best to a correctly oriented bar or edge. Complex cells, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the sign of the contrast of the bar or edge, or its exact location. They hypothesized that simple cells are generated by aggregating the correct LGN afferents selective for light and dark spots, followed by the threshold nonlinearity of the cells. Complex cells were hypothesized to be generated by pooling from similarly tuned simple cells. They later expanded these ideas: perhaps first-order and second-order hypercomplex cells are created by the repetition of the same pattern. Thus, hierarchy, selectivity, pooling and localized receptive fields were all hypothesized to be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adapted from (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). | Download Scientific Diagram&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomaso-Poggio-2/publication/265923351/figure/fig2/AS:669389284200460@1536606250398/Adapted-from-Hubel-and-Wiesel-1962.ppm&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;Annotated figures from Hubel &amp;amp; Wiesel (1962)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima (1980) adapted many of these ideas in a self-organized hierarchical neural network called the Neocognitron. In the S-layers, neurons weight the input from previous layers via localized receptive fields, followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. In C-layers, inputs from the previous are pooled linearly, followed by a sigmoid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Neocognitron also introduces what may be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; defining features of modern CNNs: parallel feature maps (here called planes) and weight sharing. This is most clearly seen in the selectivity operation for S-layers, which is a convolution over the set of local coordinates &lt;img alt=&quot;S_l&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_l&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt;, followed by a ReLU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the introduction of parallel feature maps and weight sharing is not very clear in the original paper, and in fact in section 3 the paper casts doubt on how realistic these assumptions are as a model of vision:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the basic hypotheses employed in the neocognitron is the assumption that all the S-cells in the same S-plane have input synapses of the same spatial distribution, and that only the positions of the presynaptic cells shift in parallel in accordance with the shift in position of individual S-cell’s receptive fields. It is not known whether modifiable synapses in the real nervous system are actually self-organized always keeping such conditions. Even if it is assumed to be true, neither do we know by what mechanism such a self-organization goes on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why introduce these features at all?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Topography conquers all&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima however links localized receptive fields with the idea of localized topography:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] orderly synaptic connections are formed between retina and optic tectum not only in the development in the embryo but also in regeneration in the adult amphibian or fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one of the enduring facts of visual neuroscience: inputs from the retina are preserved topologically as they make their way to the LGN, V1, and onwards to extrastriate cortex. Visual angle and log radius are mapped from the retina to V1 in development, guided by chemical gradients. The progression of the maps reverse as we go up the visual hierarchy (in fact, areas are defined by this very reversal in direction). What’s remarkable is how precise the topography is: Hubel and Wiesel estimated that in primary visual cortex, neighbouring cells varied in receptive field center by less than half a receptive field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIG. 1.&quot; height=&quot;-587&quot; src=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/cms/10.1152/jn.01202.2003/asset/images/large/z9k0070439721001.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;-305&quot; /&gt;From Ringach (2004)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another fact of life in cortex, which is that horizontal wiring is expensive. If a neuron integrates from localized inputs, and those inputs are retinotopically organized, that neuron will have a localized receptive field. If you assume that the synaptic pattern is localized and random then for every cell, there must be other similarly tuned cells somewhere else in the visual field. My postdoc advisor Dario &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01202.2003&quot;&gt;Ringach introduced a model (2004)&lt;/a&gt; for how simple cells in primary visual cortex can occur from such sparse localized connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That covers feature maps. However, if the input statistics to primary visual cortex are stationary, then a self-supervised criterion could refine a randomly initialized V1 feature map, effectively letting the input do the weight tying – a subtle point brought up by Blake Richards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Non-stationarities at the large scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope to have convinced you that the link between CNNs, first introduced by Fukushima, and early visual processing in the brain is quite subtle. Whether a CNN is a good or a bad model of early visual processing depends on what phenomenon we care to model. If we’re talking about core visual recognition in the parafovea – which is what the majority of the quantification comes from – the match is quite good. At larger spatial scales, however, I would argue that the match is compromised by two facts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, spatial resolution is not constant as a function of space. A CNN on a Cartesian grid doesn’t scale with eccentricity. This issue has received some attention lately, and foveating CNNs are starting to be considered – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/forum?id=2_Z6MECjPEa&quot;&gt;this recent paper from Arturo Deza and Talia Konkle for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/26196&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/26196%2Felife-26196-fig9-v1.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg&quot; width=&quot;459&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spatial frequency tuning correlates with spatial tuning. From Arcaro and Livingstone (2017)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the eyes foveate towards interesting targets – e.g. faces – which mean that statistics are highly nonstationary different as a function of space. The ground looks very different from the sky. Hands tend to be in the lower half of the visual field, and numerous visual areas have only partial maps of the visual field. There’s overrepresentation of radial orientations, more curvature selectivity in the fovea, no blue cones in the fovea, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture to illustrate this. If VGG19 is a good model of primary visual visual cortex, then it follows that maximizing predicted activity in primary visual cortex could be done by maximizing an unweighted sum of VGG19 subunits, a la DeepDream. If you do that for layer 7 of VGG19, you get the picture on the left. However, we can use fMRI to estimate a matrix, via ridge regression that maps VGG19 to an fMRI subspace, and then optimize a weighted sum of VGG19 subunits, giving us the picture on the right. This image highlights some of the known spatial biases in primary visual cortex – shifts in prefered spatial frequency as a function of eccentricity, radial bias, curvature bias in the fovea – which are not apparent in an unweighted VGG19. So at the very least, the brain’s image manifold is rotated and rescaled compared to the VGG19 image manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Livingstone has a very interesting line of research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_YTcec9Z0&quot;&gt;talk here&lt;/a&gt;) highlighting the close link between spatial biases and the development of object and face recognition modules in high-level visual cortex. More generally, if we’re interested in how vision is organized for action – ecological vision in the tradition of Gibson – then whether a network has captured, e.g. the fact that the bottom half of the visual field has very different affordances than the top half matters. If you applied a unsupervised criterion to learn features from natural images without weight sharing, those features would vary quite a bit across space – unlike in a CNN. This point was also raised by Dileep George.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Weight sharing is not strictly necessary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) demonstrates the use of backpropagation to train a convolutional image recognition network. There’s a beautiful figure that highlights the effect of adding more and more constraints, in particular in going from a fully-connected 2-layer network (net2) to a high-capacity convolutional neural net (net5):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7584&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7584&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1496,1026&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8/&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From LeCun (1989)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) clarifies that weight sharing is a clever trick that decreases the number of weights to be learned, which in the small data limit is practically important to obtain good test set accuracy. We are a long ways from 1989 in terms of dataset size, and unsupervised learning could learn untied feature maps, as pointed out by Yann LeCun in the Twitter thread. But would currently existing benchmarks favor ANNs-with-local-receptive-field-but-untied-weights?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The leaderboard is the message&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn back to the claim that early visual cortex is like a particular CNN. As Wu, David and Gallant (2006) put it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;an important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience [is] developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brain-score.org/&quot;&gt;Brain-Score&lt;/a&gt; is an embodiment of this idea – benchmark, across many different datasets and ventral stream areas, the ability of many different CNNs to explain brain activity. The leaderboard is pretty clear that the VGG19 architecture outperform alternatives in explaining average firing rate – even when these alternatives are better at classifying images in ImageNet. That’s an interesting finding – VGG19 is shallower and has larger receptive fields than more modern CNNs, so perhaps its performance on this benchmark is because of that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grace Lindsay pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] when the results were first coming out that trained convolutional neural networks are good predictors of activity in the visual system some people had the attitude of “that’s not interesting because obviously anything that does vision well will look like the brain”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that we now have architectures that solve object recognition which are very different from CNNs, namely visual transformers (ViT). They are architecturally different from brains, and they while they perform well on ImageNet, they underperform in predicting single neuron responses. So now we have a clear example of a disconnect between ImageNet performance and similarity to the brain, and that strengthens the claim that core object recognition is like a CNN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the one hand, the data from BrainScore says that CNNs are the best models of core object recognition, yet there are pretty stark ways in which early visual processing is unlike a CNN, some of which I’ve mentioned already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07092&quot;&gt;others which have been highlighted in Grace Lindsay’s excellent review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Would Brain-Score, in theory, rate better a model which respects the distinction between excitation and inhibition (Dale’s law)? That seems unlikely, since there are no cell type annotations in the datasets. Would it rate better a foveated model, or one that doesn’t have weight sharing? Again, unlikely, since as Tiago Marques points out, for technical reasons, most datasets are taken in the parafovea. In any case, the metric used to score the models is rotation invariant, so it wouldn’t be able to tell these cases apart. As Simon Kornblith points out, choices of metrics are not falsifiable. The right approach for choosing metrics is the axiomatic one, as demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414&quot;&gt;Simon’s CKA paper&lt;/a&gt;: the modeller or the community decides what the right metric is based off of design criterias that represent what they think is interesting about the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does that mean we should ignore Brain-Score? No! I really like Brain-Score – I wish there were many more Brain-Score-like leaderboards! Comparing on lots of datasets prevents cherry picking – there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/&quot;&gt;robustness in the meta-analytic approach&lt;/a&gt;. What I’m excited about is the possibility of Brain-Scores – a constellation of leaderboards that benchmark different models according to rules which match on modeler’s interests. I’ve been involved in proto-community-benchmark efforts like the neural prediction challenge and spikefinder before, and the technological barriers to run such a leaderboard have been lowered by commoditized cloud infra. The value proposition is also becoming clearer, and I am excited to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurallatents.github.io/&quot;&gt;more of these efforts pop up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In brief:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convolutional neural nets assume shared weights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This assumption is not valid at large spatial scales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large spatial scales matter if you care about naturalistic foveated vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a useful assumption in the low-data regime, which we’re not in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current benchmarks are not sensitive to this issue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s possible and desirable to create new benchmarks which are sensitive to this, and I hope to do that in the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s wrong to say that introverts have fared better during the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/have-introverts-really-fared-better-in-lockdown-158800&quot;&gt;writes Lis Ku&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, studies have shown that in many ways introverts’ wellbeing has suffered more than that of extraverts. This could be because extraverts may have more social support, for instance, or because extraversion is related to superior coping strategies — although Ku emphasises that there are likely many other traits, beliefs and values that are also important in determining people’s response to lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41821&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new trial suggests that the psychedelic drug psilocybin could be as good as existing antidepressant drugs at treating depression, when it is combined with psychotherapy. &lt;/strong&gt;However, researchers caution that more work with larger, more diverse samples is needed before the drug could be used outside of a research setting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/14/magic-mushroom-psilocybin-show-promise-treatment-depression-clinical-trial-finds&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;­&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the queen of a colony of Indian jumping ants dies, the worker ants compete to become the new queen. &lt;/strong&gt;Now researchers have discovered that in the process, these would-be-queens shrink their brains by about 20%. The team suspects that this is because there are fewer cognitive demands placed on an ant whose primary job is simply to reproduce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/science/ants-brains-queen.html&quot;&gt;reports Annie Roth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times, &lt;/em&gt;so energy that would be going to the workers’ brains is better spent on the reproductive system instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are older, single women labelled with the negative term “spinster”, while the only word for an unmarried man is the much more neutral “bachelor”?  &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210408-the-sexist-words-that-are-harmful-to-women&quot;&gt;Sophia Smith Galer delves into the words we use&lt;/a&gt; to discuss men and women — and asks whether language simply reflects the sexism of society, or might actually perpetuate those biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents often worry that social media is having negative effects on children’s mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;But what does the science say? Well, there’s not much evidence either way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-scientists-dont-actually-know-if-social-media-is-bad-for-you/&quot;&gt;writes Andrew Przybylski&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;, because social media companies don’t share their data with researchers. But given that social media may be an important outlet for many young people, well-intentioned efforts to intervene could end up backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can boosting kids’ “grit” help them to achieve academic success? &lt;/strong&gt;It’s a popular idea, but one without a huge amount of evidence behind it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/issue/99/universality/the-weak-case-for-grit&quot;&gt;writes Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, in an extract from his new book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making hand gestures during a lesson can help people learn abstract concepts. &lt;/strong&gt;In a recent study, participants watched an animated lesson about statistical models and then completed a test. Those who had made hand gestures to imitate parts of the lesson subsequently performed better on the test than those who had made no gestures, or those who had made gestures that were inconsistent with the lesson. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-who-gesture-during-learning-grasp-concepts-better/&quot;&gt;Matthew Hutson explains the work &lt;/a&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomedical and public health research should reflect the diversity of global health and the impact that social, cultural, and geographical factors can have on local health practice and policy. Until now, no studies have examined the contribution of developing countries to authors, editors or research in high-ranking neurology journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for research in neurology cannot be understated. Globally, neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30411-9&quot;&gt;low and middle-income countries bear almost 80% of the burden of neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. As the population continues to grow, the degree of burden will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess representation in neurology journals, we conducted a cross-sectional study of all research articles published in 2010 and 2019 in the five highest ranked peer-reviewed neurology journals: &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Neurology, Acta Neuropathologica, Nature Reviews Neurology, Brain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;. Using this data, we determined the extent of contributions of authors, editors, and research from developing countries, as well as the degree of international research collaboration between developed and developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare, and this has not changed in the past decade. First authorship was attributed to authors from developing countries in only 2% of research articles in 2010 and 3% in 2019. The lack of representation in research extends to the editorial boards of the selected journals, none of which had a board member from a developing country. Unsurprisingly, the primary data of these publications originated largely from developed countries with advanced research facilities, namely the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling underrepresentation in research is no simple feat. Nevertheless, our results highlight that there is an urgent need for strategies to support high-quality locally-driven biomedical research in developing countries. Local researchers in developing countries benefit from exposure to greater research opportunities, education, and training. This is beneficial to developing countries as they are able to direct socially and culturally relevant research that is readily applicable to local healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity through greater representation via international collaborations which strengthen the quality of research in developing countries. By fostering high-quality and culturally relevant research, local healthcare systems are able to readily apply these findings to meet the neurological needs of their population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our lives have become busier, desire to do things quickly and efficiently has grown — something the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/08/speed-reading-apps-can-you-really-read-novel-in-your-lunch-hour&quot;&gt;rise of speed reading apps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/14/eating-lunch-at-your-desk-again-study-examines-why-workers-dont-always-take-breaks/&quot;&gt;lack of break-taking at work&lt;/a&gt;, and a general focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0920-z&quot;&gt;“productivity”&lt;/a&gt; has shown. Good time management skills, therefore, are now highly prized both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But do such techniques actually work? In &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245066&quot;&gt;a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brad Aeon from Concordia University and colleagues find that they do — but perhaps not for the reasons you’d expect. While time management skills have become more important in evaluations of job performance since the 1990s, their biggest impact lies elsewhere: in personal wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41815&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time management, in brief, is a decision-making framework that helps us structure, protect and adapt our time in changing circumstances. It can therefore be measured through questions like “do you have a daily routine?”, “do you find it hard to say no to people?” and “do you evaluate your daily schedule?”. Work-life balance and attitudes to time and time management are also key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore the efficacy of time management, the team collated 158 papers from the mid-1980s to 2019 in journals in business, computing, gender studies, psychology, sociology and education; papers that included scales or questionnaires on time management were also included. (Interestingly, time management studies became more popular between 2000 and the 2010s, suggesting a wider trend and interest in the topic.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies included work on time management in academia and the workplace, individual differences in time management, and its impact on wellbeing factors such as life satisfaction, anxiety, depression, and positive and negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By looking at the effects across all of these studies, the team found that time management has a moderate, positive impact on work performance, both in terms of performance appraisal by managers and factors like motivation and involvement with work. The relationship between time management and job performance became stronger over the years the studies were published, another suggestion that time management has become a more important factor in people’s lives. This link was not as strong in academic settings — time management seemed to be less relevant to tests scores or grades than it was to performance reviews at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most individual differences were only weakly associated with time management skills: women have stronger time management skills than men, for instance, but this correlation was weak. Women’s time management skills did grow over the timeline of the meta-analysis, however perhaps a sign of more busy schedules and increased juggling of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite narratives that suggest time management is primarily a work or career-based skill, the strongest link was between good time management and wellbeing: the effect of time management on life satisfaction was 72% stronger than on job satisfaction. Time management also reduced feelings of distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall the findings suggest that time management does work — though contrary to popular belief, it is &lt;em&gt;wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; that is the most positively impacted factor, not work. Work and wellbeing are clearly linked — if you’re having a horrible time at work your life satisfaction is unlikely to be too high. But the results could mean that wellbeing is not simply a byproduct of a successfully managed work life but can be a direct result of good time management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may not want to put too much stock in time management alone, however: being good at time management, the team argues, is often a function of privilege. Things like income, class and education all influence how we are able to manage our time. They use the meme-ified phrase that “you have as many hours in the day as Beyoncé” to illustrate their point: while technically true, Beyoncé has a full team of nannies, drivers, chefs, personal trainers and more to manage her time and thus has the hours of their day as well as hers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those without such resources are unlikely to achieve as much as someone who does, and shaming them for lack of attainment is unhelpful. And though time management skills may be invaluable in a busy life, it’s also useful to remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/november-2020/you-are-more-your-productivity&quot;&gt;the words of Dr Maria Kordowicz&lt;/a&gt;, writing in November’s issue of &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist: &lt;/em&gt;you are more than your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245066&quot;&gt;Does time management work? A meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2021/04/14/organization-of-cell-assemblies-in-the-hippocampus.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Organization of Cell Assemblies in the Hippocampus&quot; and will briefly
presnt how this subject can be approached with topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A
fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in
information processing. According to the &quot;cell assembly&quot; hypothesis,
transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons
underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal
cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be
arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common
modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of
hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using
the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the
animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial
prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase
modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted
from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30,ms, suggesting
that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this
temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal
neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time
window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity
at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage
in cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649110286/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ungemah-iStock-blog-image-744x286.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past month marked an anniversary like no other. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and with it, normal life of eating out, commuting to work, and seeing grandparents came to a sudden halt. One year later, my new book about the intersection of psychology and the workplace was published. With wide-scale vaccinations on the rise, I thought it would be a good time to take stock of where we are and just how much has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, major shifts in how employees think about and interact with their workplace were well underway. Routine tasks were increasingly handed over to automation, such that workers could concentrate on more complex or valuable activities. Employees were being shuffled into new environments guided by activity-based working, with neighborhoods and open-plan floor plans replacing traditional cubicles. Gig working was on the rise and self-employed side hustles were becoming the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 added fuel to the fire. During the pandemic’s peak, approximately 30% of employees were working from home, while internet use surged by up to 30% of pre-pandemic levels, as workers competed for bandwidth with their kids who were now thrown into distance learning. Social collaboration tools, like Zoom and Teams, found the footing that they were searching for and quickly became the default means of working with peers and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though employers made swift and effective adjustments, the pandemic unearthed social inequalities that were bubbling under the surface. Whereas over half of information workers in the US (e.g. consultants or managers) had the luxury to stay safe by working from home, only 1 in 20 service workers could do the same. These workers were tied to their physical workplace, making cars, cooking food, or cleaning hospitals, and often represented people of color. They bore the brunt of the sudden lockdown in normal life, having to both put themselves at risk and be left without the tools to work in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sustainable progress towards an end to the pandemic in sight, employers have already made decisions that will have lasting effects on the workplace. Remote working has proven both feasible and effective for even the most skeptical companies, resulting in many employers encouraging hybrid working. Exactly what this means is still up in the air, even for Big Technology. Twitter and Spotify have vowed to make remote working indefinite, while Google requires employees who plan to spend more than 14 days at home annually to apply for special permission. Somewhere in between are Facebook, Salesforce, and Amazon who have all stated support for a hybrid model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offices that employees are returning to will also look and feel different. This past year has given employers the rare opportunity to reassess their real estate portfolio. For example, companies like Target have recently announced a reduction of their office footprint, anticipating lower utilization due to hybrid working. When they do come in, workers will be there to collaborate with peers, access tools and technology, or simply meet up as a team. What is increasingly off the menu is the solitary, heads-down type of work that was typically done in a cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, much of the shift to the Future of Work has been unidimensional, by tackling the physical workplace. What lags behind is a new set of behaviors and social norms that will help guide employees about how and when they should interact with their new workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, video conferencing breaks down the separation between home and work life. Catching a glimpse of a curious four-year-old popping up on screen or spotting laundry that has yet to be put away creates unintended and possibly inappropriate intimacy. Whereas, choices about when to turn on the camera and what hours are truly off-limits have yet to fully work themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the tangible office, effective remote working will be made possible by a range of behaviors and social norms that interplay with the motivations, needs, and desires of employees. Wearing a suit while on camera not only looks odd, but plays against our desire for being comfortable at home. There is a competing interest between looking professional and feeling comfortable, with the answer resting somewhere between formalwear and pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment. Drivers like identity, reward, and obedience are all still in play, but will take on a distinct flavor as we migrate to a new way of working. Building rapport on Zoom is different than sitting down for a meal, just like observing job performance in person benefits from a degree of constant visibility that will go missing with remote work. Following the pandemic, there is little doubt that the workplace will fundamentally change; the question is how and when the psychology of workers will catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Read a free chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190061241.001.0001/oso-9780190061241-chapter-2?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social%20media&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oupac-campaign%3A1359185357522304002&quot;&gt;“Connection” from&lt;em&gt; Punching the Clock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, freely available until 13 May 2021.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/piranka?mediatype=photography&quot;&gt;piranka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649110286/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649110286/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f04%2fUngemah-iStock-blog-image-744x286.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-if-covid-19-had-emerged-in-1719/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What if COVID-19 had emerged in 1719?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-coming-refugee-crisis-how-covid-19-exacerbates-forced-displacement/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The coming refugee crisis: how COVID-19 exacerbates forced displacement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-warrior-gene-blaming-genetics-for-bad-behavior/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Who Identify With Humanity As A Whole Are More Likely To Say They’d Follow Pandemic Guidelines And Help Others</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/14/people-who-identify-with-humanity-as-a-whole-are-more-likely-to-say-theyd-follow-pandemic-guidelines-and-help-others/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ever-changing public health measures rolled out during the coronavirus pandemic haven’t always been crystal clear. But several instructions have remained the same throughout: wear a mask, wash your hands, and stay two metres apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the strength and frequency of this messaging, however, the public hasn’t always complied. Though the exact reason for this non-compliance is clearly complex, researchers from the University of Washington have proposed one factor that could influence people’s behaviour: the extent to which they identify with other human beings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248234&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they suggest that a connection with and moral commitment to other humans may be linked to greater willingness to follow COVID-related guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41801&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 2537 adults from across the world, based in countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia. First, they were asked how likely they were to comply with the health behaviours recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) at the start of 2020, when the pandemic begun to spread across the world. The four key behaviours the WHO recommended were thoroughly washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, social distancing, and not touching the face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were then asked how likely they were to engage in four prosocial behaviours: donating masks to a hospital, picking up someone with COVID-19 from the side of the road, going grocery shopping for a family that needed food despite stay-at-home guidelines, and calling an ambulance for someone afflicted with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then indicated how strict their country or area’s lockdown was at the time, how available tests were in their area, and how much they perceived themselves at personal risk of contracting the virus. They also reported how much they identified with their own community and their own nation, and finally how much they identified with all humanity (e.g. responding to statements like “how much do you believe in being loyal to all humanity?”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who identified more strongly with all of humanity were significantly more likely to say they’d engage both in prosocial behaviours, such as donating masks and going grocery shopping for others, and in the WHO health behaviours designed to stop the spread of the virus. Other factors also had an impact on prosocial behaviours — identification with one’s community was strongly linked with several outcomes, for instance. But identification with all of humanity was the only variable that significantly predicted &lt;em&gt;all five&lt;/em&gt; outcomes, and had a much larger effect than any of the other variables.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are positive news for those who reject nationalism — participants who identified more closely both with their own community &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; humanity as a whole were more likely to engage in prosocial and health behaviours than those who strongly identified with their nation alone. As the team puts it, the strongest prosocial behaviour is seen in those who feel connected to “the larger family of humanity” than to a specific nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how, exactly, does identification with humanity develop? Further research could look at the genesis of such ideas, as well as looking at a wider demographic sample (72% of this sample were university educated, for example). Ascertaining whether certain personality types or traits are linked to such beliefs could also be illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear how far these findings go in explaining not just non-compliance but outright &lt;em&gt;rejection&lt;/em&gt; of guidelines. Finding out what makes anti-lockdown groups tick may also be necessary when it comes to increasing uptake of public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248234&quot;&gt;Identifying with all humanity predicts cooperative health behaviors and helpful responding during COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Operational Response to US Measles Outbreaks, 2017-19</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/04/13/operational-response-to-us-measles-outbreaks-2017-19/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/measles-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread coverage with a highly efficacious vaccine, pockets of under vaccinated populations and imported cases can result in sizable measles outbreaks. And even though measles was declared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/elimination.html&quot;&gt;eliminated in the United States&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 years ago, the country has faced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html&quot;&gt;series of large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in the years since, particularly over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10652-9&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, we conducted interviews with individuals from state and local health departments and health systems from across the country who responded to measles outbreaks in 2017-19, representing outbreaks that account for more than 75% of all US measles cases over that period. Our principal aim was to capture firsthand operational experiences in order to generate evidence-based lessons that can inform preparedness activities for future outbreaks of measles and other highly transmissible diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study took place under the umbrella of a larger initiative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/about-1/#mission&quot;&gt;Outbreak Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to address the operational challenges and barriers faced during outbreak responses and disseminate lessons to facilitate future preparedness and response efforts. Outbreak responses tend to be busy times that do not lend themselves to documenting operational knowledge acquired during the response. Outbreak Observatory aims to provide a forum to aggregate those lessons so that other jurisdictions can put them into practice without having to learn them firsthand. Previous Outbreak Observatory studies—including on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305139&quot;&gt;2017-18 US hepatitis A epidemic&lt;/a&gt; and the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/preparedness-and-response-to-an-emerging-health-threatlessons-learned-from-candida-auris-outbreaks-in-the-united-states/8A4AD3D3F0C26821C652723765985BFB&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2753&quot;&gt;2017-18 influenza season&lt;/a&gt; on US health systems—identified lessons that reach beyond those individual responses to inform broader outbreak and epidemic preparedness. As highlighted by the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic response, it is critical to share the wealth of operational experience held by frontline responders to improve outbreak response readiness and capacity in advance of future communicable disease events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants in our study on US measles outbreaks called attention to a number of resource and operational gaps during their response operations that apply directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these outbreaks were quite large, none even remotely compared to the scale of the US COVID-19 epidemic. Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing. These gaps became front-page news with COVID-19, as health departments around the country struggled to implement effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/health/coronavirus-testing-labs-workers.html&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03518-4&quot;&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02478-z&quot;&gt;other surveillance operations&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Additionally, most health departments interviewed in this study indicated that they did not have the resources available to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/02/biden-promises-enough-covid-19-vaccines-all-americans-end-of-may/&quot;&gt;mass vaccination operations&lt;/a&gt; in response to the outbreak. Rather, they relied heavily on healthcare providers and pharmacists in the community to administer the vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have observed during the COVID-19 response—first with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/03/etruenorth-tiny-company-running-covid-19-company/&quot;&gt;mass testing clinics&lt;/a&gt; and currently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2102535&quot;&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;—health departments need considerable external resources to stand up large-scale responses for major epidemics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tfah.org/report-details/publichealthfunding2020/&quot;&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily&lt;/a&gt; over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the outbreaks included in this study, many of which occurred largely in insular communities—eg, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, orthodox religious communities—COVID-19 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html&quot;&gt;disproportionately impacted vulnerable racial and ethnic minority communities&lt;/a&gt;. Public health and healthcare organizations faced significant barriers to encouraging vaccination among the affected communities, and we are currently observing similar challenges as the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines scales up and eligibility groups expand. During the measles outbreaks, health officials often relied on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmj4.com/news/coronavirus/most-trusted-voices-are-local-doctors-clergy-wh-press-secretary-psaki-talks-vaccine-hesitancy-and-access-in-tmj4-exclusive&quot;&gt;community healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those that serve vulnerable and insular communities, to engage with the affected community. Additionally, trusted community leaders—including religious leaders, business owners, and community-based organizations—played a critical role as trusted voices to disseminate accurate information regarding protective measures, including vaccination. It requires substantial time and resources to develop these relationships, however, and it can be very difficult to do so in the midst of an outbreak or epidemic response. Health departments that had previously established relationships (e.g., from previous outbreaks) found it easier to leverage these community leaders to make a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the disease epidemiology or clinical care or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1201971218345466&quot;&gt;disease epidemiology or clinical care&lt;/a&gt; or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly. It is critical to understand the operational experiences of frontline responders, including public health and healthcare organizations, and to translate those experiences into evidence-based lessons that can inform other preparedness efforts. Without these lessons, the jurisdictions repeat the same mistakes and must learn those lessons firsthand. And the challenges, barriers, and shortcomings identified during smaller outbreaks will only be exacerbated during larger events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to document and disseminate these operational experiences, like Outbreak Observatory and others, support the development of programs and policies that can enable sustainable public health preparedness capacity that is needed for a range of communicable disease events, from smaller outbreaks to larger health emergencies like COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role does play have in child development? &lt;/strong&gt;In this episode, our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt; talks to some top play researchers to find out how children learn new skills and concepts through play, and explores what teachers and parents can do to encourage this kind of learning. Ginny also discovers how the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way kids play and learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/marilyn-fleer&quot;&gt;Professor Marilyn Fleer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/prabhat-rai&quot;&gt;Dr Prabhat Rai&lt;/a&gt; from Monash University, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mic.ul.ie/staff/244-suzanne-egan&quot;&gt;Dr Suzanne Egan&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Limerick.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bits of DNA: The amoral nonsense of Orchid’s embryo selection</title>
	<link>https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about Clubhouse yet… well, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolis/2021/01/26/the-latest-silicon-valley-unicorn-clubhouse-raises-100-million-and-also-raises-attention-to-the-importance-of-audio-based-social-networking/?sh=581771e823a6&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the latest Silicon Valley unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; popular new chat hole for thought leaders. I heard about it for the first time a few months ago, and was kindly offered an invitation (Club house is invitation only!) so I could explore what it is all about. Clubhouse is an app for audio based social networking, and the content is, as far as I can tell, a mixed bag. I’ve listened to a handful of conversations hosted on the app.. topics include everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/everyone-wants-invite-clubhouse-crypto&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/01/26/forget-about-san-francisco-and-silicon-valley-miami-is-planning-on-being-the-next-great-tech-hub/?sh=7aceb2ea466e&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. It was interesting, at times, to hear the thoughts and opinions of some of the discussants. On the other hand, there is a lot of superficial rambling on Clubhouse as well. During a conversation about genetics I heard someone posit that biology has a lot to learn from the fashion industry. This was delivered in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZBKX-6Gz6A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you are hearing something profound&lt;/a&gt;” manner, by someone who clearly knew nothing about either biology or the fashion industry, which is really too bad, because the fashion industry is quite interesting and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if biology has something to learn from it. Unfortunately, I never learned what that is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the regulars on Clubhouse is &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Noor Siddiqui&lt;/a&gt;. You may not have heard of her; in fact she is officially “not notable”. That is to say, she used to have a Wikipedia page but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Noor_Siddiqui&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deleted on the grounds that there is nothing about her that indicates notability&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course notable in and of itself… a paradox that says more about Wikipedia’s gatekeeping than Siddiqui (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russell 1903&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1380003729445896194?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Litt 2021&lt;/a&gt;). In any case, Siddiqui was recently part of a Clubhouse conversation on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.joinclubhouse.com/event/PD4qybXo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;convergence of genomics and reproductive technology&lt;/a&gt;” together with Carlos Bustamante (advisor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/luna-dna-will-give-bitcoins-genomic-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency based Luna DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cdbustamante/status/1380991720431742978?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soon to be professor of business technology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Miami) and Balaji Srinivasan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;). As it happens, Siddiqui is the CEO of a startup called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health&lt;/a&gt;“, in the genomics and reproductive technology “space”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The company promises&lt;/a&gt; to harness “population genetics, statistical modeling, reproductive technologies, and the latest advances in genomic science” to “give parents the option to lower a future child’s genetic risk by creating embryos through in IVF and implanting embryos in the order that can reduce disease risk.” This “product” will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Bustamante and Srinivasan are early “&lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/announcing-orchid&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operators and investors&lt;/a&gt;” in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid is not Siddiqui’s first startup. While she doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, she does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where she boasts of having (briefly) been a Thiel fellow and, together with her sister, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtimes.com/articles/14126/20140827/google-glass-has-a-place-in-the-medical-industry-with-a-new-app.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting a company&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager. The idea of the (briefly in existence) startup was apparently to help the now commercially defunct &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/google-glass-smart-glasses-what-happened-explained/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; gain acceptance by bringing the device to the medical industry. According to Siddiqui, Orchid is also not her first dive into statistical modeling or genomics. She notes on her website that she did “AI and genomics research”, specifically on “deep learning for genomics”. Such training and experience could have been put to good use but…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygenic risk scores and polygenic embryo selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health claims that it will “safely and naturally, protect your baby from diseases that run in your family” (the slogan “have healthy babies” is prominently displayed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt;). The way it will do this is to utilize “&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/orchid-blooms-with-4-5m-seed-for-preconception-test-to-determine-genetic-risks/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;” to screen embryos created through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/embryo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;“. What this means in (a statistical geneticist’s) layman’s terms is that &lt;strong&gt;Orchid is planning to use polygenic risk scores derived from genome-wide association studies to perform polygenic embryo selection for complex diseases&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be easily unpacked because it’s quite a simple proposition, although it’s far from a trivial one- the statistical genetics involved is deep and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;single-gene disorder&lt;/a&gt; is a health problem that is caused by a single mutation in the genome. Examples of such disorders include Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia, Huntington’s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and many other diseases. A “complex disease”, also called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifactorial_diseases&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multifactorial disease&lt;/a&gt;, is a disease that has a genetic component, but one that involves multiple genes, i.e. it is&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;not a single-gene disorder. Crucially, complex diseases may involve effects of environmental factors, whose role in causing disease may depend on the genetic composition of an individual. The list of diseases on Orchid’s website, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease are all examples of complex (multifactorial) diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify genes that &lt;em&gt;associate &lt;/em&gt;with a complex disease, researchers perform &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genome-wide association studies&lt;/a&gt; (GWAS). In such studies, researchers typically analyze several million genomic sites in a large numbers of individuals with and without a disease (used to be thousands of individuals, nowadays hundreds of thousands or millions) and perform regressions to assess the marginal effect at each locus. I italicized the word associate above, because genome-wide association studies do not, in and of themselves, point to genomic loci that cause disease. Rather, they produce, as output, lists of genomic loci that have varying degrees of association with the disease or trait of interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polygenic risk scores&lt;/a&gt; (PRS), which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/broadinstitute/status/1354804918264098817?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Broad Institute claims to have discovered&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: they were not discovered at the Broad Institute), are a way to combine the multiple genetic loci associated with a complex disease from a GWAS. Specifically, a PRS &lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{S}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; for a complex disease is given by&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of a PRS is straightforward, but the details are complicated, in some cases subtle, and generally non-trivial. There is debate over how many genomic loci should be used in computing a polygenic risk score given that the vast majority of marginal effects are very close to zero (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/28/R2/R143/5555564&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Janssens 2019&lt;/a&gt;), lots of ongoing research about how to set the weights to account for issues such as bias caused by&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; linkage disequilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22050&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shin et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22245&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newcombe et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09718-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ge et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12653-0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lloyd-Jones et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pattee and Pan 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), and continuing discussions about the ethics of using polygenic risk scores in the clinic (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00829-7&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lewis and Green 2021&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much of the discussion around PRS applications centers on applications such as determining diagnostic testing frequency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2019&lt;/a&gt;),  polygenic embryo selection (PES) posits that polygenic risk scores should be taken a step further and evaluated for embryos to be used as a basis for discarding, or selecting, specific embryos for in vitro fertilization implantation. The idea has been widely criticized and critiqued (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31210-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419312103%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karavani et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). It has been described as unethical, morally repugnant, and concerns about its use for eugenics have been voiced by many. Underlying these criticisms is the fact that the technical issues with PES using PRS are manifold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor penetrance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;penetrance&lt;/a&gt;” for a disease refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genetic variant that have the disease. Many single-gene disorders have very high penetrance. For example, F508del mutation in the CFTR gene is 100% penetrant for cystic fibrosis. That is, 100% of people who are homozygous for this variant, meaning that both copies of their DNA have a deletion of the phenylalanine amino acid in position 508 of their CFTR gene, will have cystic fibrosis. The vast majority of variants associated with complex diseases have very low penetrance. For example, in schizophrenia, the penetrance of “high risk” &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; copy number variants (in which there are variable copies of DNA at a genomic loci) was found to be between 2% and 7.4% (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/17/3477/677022&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vassos et al 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The low penetrance at large numbers of variants for complex diseases was precisely the rationale for developing polygenic risk scores in the first place, the idea being that while individual variants yield small effects, perhaps in (linear) combination they can have more predictive power. While it is true that combining variants does yield more predictive power for complex diseases, unfortunately the accuracy is, in absolute terms, very low. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason for low predictive power of PRS is explained well in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and is illustrated for coronary artery disease (CAD) in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073510972035155X?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rotter and Lin 2020&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14722&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14722&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;rotterandlin&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1698,1302&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/rotterandlin/&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue is that while the polygenic risk score distribution may indeed be shifted for individuals with a disease, and while this shift may be statistically significant resulting in large odds ratios, i.e. much higher &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; risk for individuals with higher PRS, the proportion of individuals in the tail of the distributions who will or won’t develop the disease will greatly affect the predictive power of the PRS. For example, Wald and Old note that PRS for CAD from (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khera et al. 2018&lt;/a&gt;) will confer a detection rate of only 15% with a false positive rate of 5%. At a 3% false positive rate the detection rate would be only 10%. This is visible in the figure above, where it is clear that control of the false positive right (i.e. thresholding at the extreme right-hand side with high PRS score) will filter out many (most) affected individuals. The same issue is raised in the excellent review on PES of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01019-3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lázaro-Muńoz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The authors explain that “even if a PRS in the top decile for schizophrenia conferred a nearly fivefold increased risk for a given embryo, this would still yield a &amp;gt;95% chance of not developing the disorder.” It is worth noting in this context, that diseases like schizophrenia are not even well defined phenotypically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120305047?casa_token=gKO_3q8Fr5gAAAAA:cvtDCj7tY2Pj6ZFcpLS3KgGN0MnnNlxcgU5rsL0P-DhIOdYQD6wIU2GBAWFuT6Ou51njyLqs_A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mølstrøm et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which is another complex matter that is too involved to go into detail here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent tweet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Siddiqui describes natural conception as a genetic lottery&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Orchid Health, by performing PES, can tilt the odds in customers’ favor. To do so the false positive rate must be low, or else too many embryos will be discarded. But a 15% sensitivity is highly problematic considering the risks inherent with IVF in the first place (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g252&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kamphuis et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be concrete, an odds ratio of 2.8 for cerebral palsy needs to be balanced against the fact that in the Khera et al. study, only 8% of individuals had an odds ratio &amp;gt;3.0 for CAD. Other diseases are even worse, in this sense, than CAD. In atrial fibrillation (one of the diseases on Orchid Health’s list), only 9.3% of the individuals in the top 0.44% of the atrial fibrillation PRS actually had atrial fibrillation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315686&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Choi et al 2019&lt;/a&gt;).As one starts to think carefully about the practical aspects and tradeoffs in performing PES, other issues, resulting from the low penetrance of complex disease variants, come into play as well. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370478v2.full&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lencz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;) examine these tradeoffs in detail, and conclude that “the differential performance of PES across selection strategies and risk reduction metrics may be difficult to communicate to couples seeking assisted reproductive technologies… These difficulties are expected to exacerbate the already profound ethical issues raised by PES… which include stigmatization, autonomy (including “choice overload”, and equity. In addition, the ever-present specter of eugenics may be especially salient in the context of the LRP (lowest-risk prioritization) strategy.” They go on to “call for urgent deliberations amongst key stakeholders (including researchers, clinicians, and patients) to address governance of PES and for the development of policy statements by professional societies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predicaments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation I had with &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F2LPg4AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicolas Bray&lt;/a&gt; several years ago shortly after the exciting discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing, on the implications of the technology for improving human health. Nick pointed out that the development of genomics had been curiously “backwards”. Thirty years ago, when human genome sequencing was beginning in earnest, the hope was that with the sequence at hand we would be able to start figuring out the function of genes, and even individual base pairs in the genome. At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/1992/genome-1209&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the human genome project was billed as&lt;/a&gt; being able to “help scientists search for genes associated with human disease” and it was imagined that “greater understanding of the genetic errors that cause disease should pave the way for new strategies in diagnosis, therapy, and disease prevention.” Instead, what happened is that genome editing technology has arrived well before we have any idea of what the vast majority of the genome does, let alone the implications of edits to it. Similarly, while the coupling of IVF and genome sequencing makes it possible to select embryos based on genetic variants today, the reality is that we have no idea how the genome functions, or what the vast majority of genes or variants actually do.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14725&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14725&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;1_5Fr1LgIxEpYNApdOCu98cA&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;500,224&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca/&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=500&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that is known about the genome is that it is chock full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/a&gt;. This is statistical genetics jargon for the fact that variation at a single locus in the genome can affect many traits simultaneously. Whereas one might think naïvely that there are distinct genes affecting individual traits, in reality the genome is a complex web of interactions among its constituent parts, leading to extensive pleiotropy. In some cases pleiotropy can be &lt;em&gt;antagonistic&lt;/em&gt;, which means that a genomic variant may simultaneously be harmful and beneficial. A famous example of this is the mutation to the beta globin gene that confers malaria resistance to heterozygotes (individuals with just one of their DNA copies carrying the mutation) and sickle cell anemia to homozygotes (individuals with both copies of their DNA carrying the mutation). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of complex diseases we don’t really know enough, or anything, about the genome to be able to truly assess pleiotropy risks (or benefits). But there are some worries already. For example, HLA Class II genes are associated with Type I and non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/105/3/e245/5715056&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jacobi et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;), Parkinson’s disease (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurology.com/articles/shared-human-leukocyte-antigen-hla-coverage-in-dementia-and-parkinsons-disease.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James and Georgopolous 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which also describes an association with dementia) and Alzheimer’s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12017-020-08612-4&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wang and Xing 2020&lt;/a&gt;). PES that results in selection against the variants associated with these diseases could very well lead to population susceptibility to infectious disease. Having said that, it is worth repeating that we don’t really know if the danger is serious, because we don’t have any idea what the vast majority of the genome does, nor the nature of antagonistic pleiotropy present in it. Almost certainly by selecting for one trait according to PRS, embryos will also be selected for a host of other unknown traits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, what can be said is that while Orchid Health is trying to convince potential customers to not “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roll the dice&lt;/a&gt;“, by ignoring the complexities of pleiotropy and its implications for embryo selection, what the company is actually doing is in fact&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;rolling the dice for its customers (for a fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health’s selling points&lt;/a&gt; is that unlike other tests that “look at 2% of only one partner’s genome…Orchid sequences 100% of both partner’s genomes” resulting in “6 billion data points”. This refers to the “couples report”, which is a companion product of sorts to the polygenic embryo screening. The couples report is assembled by using the sequenced genomes of parents to simulate the genomes of potential babies, each of which is evaluated for PRS’ to provide a range of (PRS based) disease predictions for the couples potential children. Sequencing a whole genome is a lot more expensive that just assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel. That may be one reason that most direct-to-consumer genetics is based on polymorphism panels rather than sequencing. There is another: the vast majority of variation in the genome occurs at a known polymorphic sites (there are a few million out of the approximately 3 billion base pairs in the genome), and to the extent that a variant might associate with a disease, it is likely that a neighboring common variant, which will be inherited together with the causal one, can serve as a proxy. There are rare variants that have been shown to associate with disease, but whether or not they explain can explain a large fraction of (genetic) disease burden is still an open question (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young 2019&lt;/a&gt;). So what has Siddiqui, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;touts the benefits of whole-genome sequencing in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that others such as 23andme have missed? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is value to whole-genome sequencing for polygenic risk score analysis, but it is when one is performing the genome-wide association studies on which the PRS are based. The reason is a bit subtle, and has to do with differences in genetics between populations. Specifically, as explained in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0610-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;De La Vega and Bustamante, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), variants that associate with a disease in one population may be different than variants that associate with the disease in another population, and whole-genome sequencing across populations can help to mitigate biases that result when restricting to SNP panels. Unfortunately, as De La Vega and Bustamante note, whole-genome sequencing for GWAS “would increase costs by orders of magnitude”. In any case, the value of whole-genome sequencing for PRS lies mainly in identifying relevant variants, not in assessing risk in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of population structure affecting PRS unfortunately transcends considerations about whole-genome sequencing. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/psychgenetics/Fulltext/2018/10000/Polygenic_risk_score_for_schizophrenia_is_more.2.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Curtis 2018&lt;/a&gt;) shows that PRS for schizophrenia is more strongly associated with ancestry than with the disease. Specifically, he shows that “The PRS for schizophrenia varied significantly between ancestral groups and was much higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between these groups was 10 times as high as the mean difference between European schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African and European subjects hardly overlapped.” The figure from Curtis’ paper showing the distribution of PRS for schizophrenia across populations is displayed below (the three letter codes at the bottom are abbreviations for different population groups; CEU stands for Northern Europeans from Utah and is the lowest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of PRS on population is a problem that is compounded by a general problem with GWAS, namely that Europeans and individuals of European descent have been significantly oversampled in GWAS. Furthermore, even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of PRS can depend on confounding factors such as socio-economic status (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/48376&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mostafavi et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). Practically speaking, the implications for PES are beyond troubling. The PRS scores in the reports customers of Orchid Health may be inaccurate or meaningless due to not only the genetic background or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;admixture&lt;/a&gt; of the parents involved, but also other unaccounted for factors. Embryo selection on the basis of such data becomes worse than just throwing dice, it can potentially lead to unintended consequences in the genomes of the selected embryos. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0379-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;) show unequivocally that clinical use of polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People pathos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are jumping aboard a technically incoherent venture and are willing to set aside serious ethical and moral concerns is not very surprising. See, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-response-to-wsj-doubts-about-new-technology-2015-10&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by its investors despite concerns being raised about the technical foundations of the company. After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical story &lt;/a&gt;appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the company put out a statement that &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Bad stories]…come along when you threaten to change things, seeded by entrenched interests that will do anything to prevent change, but in the end nothing will deter us from making our tests the best and of the highest integrity for the people we serve, and continuing to fight for transformative change in health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;did bother a few investors at the time&lt;/a&gt;, many stayed the course for a while longer. Siddiqui uses similar language, brushing off criticism by complaining about paternalism in the health care industry and gatekeeping, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stating that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an age of seismic change in biotech – the ability to sequence genomes, the ability to edit genomes, and now the unprecedented ability to impact the health of a future child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her investors, many of whom got rich from cryptocurrency trading or bitcoin, cheer her on. One of her investors is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;, who believes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Orchid is] a step towards where we need to go in medicine.&lt;/a&gt;” I think I can understand some of the ego and money incentives of Silicon Valley that drive such sentiment. But one thing that disappoints me is that scientists I personally held in high regard, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/jan-liphardt&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jan Liphardt&lt;/a&gt; (associate professor of Bioengineering at Stanford) who is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/careers#scientists&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientific advisory board&lt;/a&gt; and Carlos Bustamante (co-author of the paper about population structure associated biases in PRS mentioned above) who is an investor in Orchid Health, have associated themselves with the company. It’s also very disturbing that Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of 23andme whose team of statistical geneticists understand the subtleties of PRS, still went ahead and invested in the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health’s polygenic embryo selection, which it will be offering later this year, is unethical and morally repugnant. My suggestion is to think twice before &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10JnJomtaCrGi0HE8r2EnwGvPzE4vJWAMHUR0HMXQcIg/viewform?edit_requested=true&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sending them three years of tax returns&lt;/a&gt; to try to get a discount on their product.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re Worse At Remembering Exactly What We’ve Given To Friends Than What We’ve Given To Strangers</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/12/were-worse-at-remembering-exactly-what-weve-given-to-friends-than-what-weve-given-to-strangers/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s say a friend asks you to help them to move house. When deciding how much time you can offer, you might consider how much you’ve helped that particular friend lately (and perhaps how much they’ve helped you). But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19656-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests that if that friend is particularly close, you’re likely to have a poorer memory of just how much time you’ve dedicated to helping them. You might offer more help than you would to an acquaintance not just because this friend is closer, but because your brain’s distinction between a close friend and yourself is blurrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41780&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that the closer we are to someone, the less clear is the distinction between our mental representations of our own self and their self is supported by various &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/08/close-friends-become-absorbed-into-our-self-concept-affecting-our-ability-to-distinguish-their-faces-from-our-own/&quot;&gt;earlier studies, including some that we’ve covered.&lt;/a&gt; In the new work, Pinar Uğurlar at the University of Cologne, Germany and colleagues asked three separate groups of participants to divvy up a series of theoretical resources (pizzas, for example, and bitcoin) between themselves and another person, then later recall just how much of each they’d given away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the theoretical recipient was the person that the participants had identified as being “closest” to them. These participants had also completed something called the Independent Self-Construal Scale. This asks for levels of endorsement of statements such as “I am a unique person separate from others”. The results showed that those with a more distinct self-representation had better recall of how much pizza, and so on, they had chosen to give away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In follow-up studies, the team looked for any differences in recall when people were asked to allocate resources to the person closest to them or to someone they had only met once. The researchers found that when people were interacting (in this hypothetical scenario) with a close friend, their recall was significantly poorer than when they were interacting with someone they barely knew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical nature of the studies is certainly a limitation. Also, the team did not directly investigate perceived levels of self/other overlap or the effect of this on memory. Still, the work does suggest that closeness “can indeed impair people’s memory of their own decisions”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There could be a social upside to this, however. Giving away resources (whether that’s time or food, say, or materials) to benefit others carries an immediate cost to an individual. Blurred distinctions between the self and close others could make it easier for a person to make that selfless decision, and so benefit their group — which in the longer term, benefits them. As the team suggests, “not fully separating the self from others on a purely cognitive level may help groups resolved social dilemmas.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19656-001&quot;&gt;Interpersonal closeness impairs decision memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might have heard of the “Mozart effect”, the idea that playing babies classical music can boost their intelligence. &lt;/strong&gt;But is there any truth to that claim? In a word, no — but check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p09cz6j6/can-listening-to-classical-music-really-boost-intelligence-&quot;&gt;nice video from Claudia Hammond&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Reel&lt;/em&gt; to learn more about where the myth came from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41769&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies have found that both male and female observers — including healthcare professionals — underestimate the amount of pain that women are experiencing&lt;/strong&gt;. We may overestimate men’s pain as well, and there’s some evidence that these gender biases even extend to beliefs about children’s pain. But more work is needed to understand perceptions of pain beyond the standard pool of White, western participants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/womens-pain-is-routinely-underestimated-and-gender-stereotypes-are-to-blame-new-research-158599&quot;&gt;writes Amanda C de C Williams&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a common belief that you can spot a liar by the way they act. &lt;/strong&gt;But research suggests this isn’t really the case: we are no good at deciding whether someone is lying based on their nonverbal behaviour. And while psychologists have found that there are other, better ways of probing the truth of a suspect’s story — such as specific interview techniques — many police forces and border security officials still rely on the old, ineffective methods, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210401-how-to-tell-when-someone-is-lying&quot;&gt;writes Jessica Seigel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Psychological Science Accelerator could offer a new model for conducting psychology research, potentially helping the field to get past its replication crisis. &lt;/strong&gt;The group has already launched several large, international, pre-registered studies, both replications and new work. But is the model sustainable? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22360363/replication-crisis-psychological-science-accelerator&quot;&gt;Brian Resnick takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to think we should fix something by adding more stuff to it.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s according to series of studies in which participants were presented with various scenarios like improving a travel itinerary or essay: most people tended to add destinations or words, rather than removing them. But the work also suggests that prompts and opportunities for practice can make people more likely to find “subtractive” solutions instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/the-takeaway-is-that-we-dont-tend-to-take-things-away/&quot;&gt;writes John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A US panel has concluded that the use of brain organoids in research is ethical&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/studies-make-brainlike-structures-or-add-human-cells-animal-brains-are-ethical-now&quot;&gt;reports Jocelyn Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The committee, set up by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, found that it is “extremely unlikely” that in the near future brain organoids will be conscious, and that there is no need for any new form of oversight for work using these “mini-brains”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does growing up in poverty affect brain development? &lt;/strong&gt;A number of studies have found that children from an impoverished background show certain differences in brain structure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/03/the-psychological-impacts-of-poverty-digested/&quot;&gt;as we wrote in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But this data is largely correlational — so now, researchers are looking at how reducing poverty by providing regular cash payments actually affects cognition and brain development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/upshot/stimulus-children-poverty-brain.html&quot;&gt;reports Alla Katsnelson&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Dealing with measles outbreaks in areas of high anti-vaccination sentiment</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/04/09/dealing-with-measles-outbreaks-in-areas-of-high-anti-vaccination-sentiment/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing the spread of infectious diseases has taken on heightened significance over the last year, as COVID-19 swept the world. Terms like ‘contact tracing’ and ‘vaccine trials’ have become hot discussion topics for the general population, not just those who work in public health or medical research. But the research I want to share here was research conducted before coronavirus was even ‘a thing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, we set out to uncover what the top priorities are when dealing with a &lt;em&gt;measles&lt;/em&gt; outbreak, particularly in a region where there might be lower than average vaccination rates. We conducted a multi-round survey (an interactive method known as a Delphi survey) with a range of Australian health professionals who are responsible for managing and responding to a disease outbreak: public health officials, infectious disease experts, immunization program staff, and others involved in delivering vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to find out what they see as the priority issues when trying to contain an outbreak. We asked our participants to imagine a measles outbreak in a hypothetical region known for its low levels of childhood vaccination coverage. We asked them what practical issues and challenges they would face, and what they would need from non-vaccinating members of the community to effectively manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study we undertook is part of a broader project called UPCaV for short – ‘Understanding, Parenting, Communities and Vaccination’. This project has been examining vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Australia from a range of different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier phase of the project involved in-depth interviews with Australian parents who refuse some or all vaccines for their children. Some of the findings from that phase have been published by Wiley et al (2020). Parents reported feeling stigmatized, bullied, disrespected and misunderstood. Notably, not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”, a label that has become increasingly used in media reporting and one that tends to close down conversation rather than open it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that stood out the most for me from our Delphi survey, was that trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy. Trying to change the minds of vaccine-refusers was not considered a priority during an outbreak, nor was offering vaccination. Participants’ first priority was to contact potentially infected people and isolate vulnerable members of the community in order to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I found compelling in our findings, were the responses to a question about what strategies are most successful for countering mistrust among non-vaccinating parents during an outbreak. Recurring responses to this question were the need for patience and calm education. Panellists suggested it was important to highlight to parents the serious complications that can arise from measles. And they suggested that it is important not to get into arguments with non-vaccinating members of the community, but instead to offer reassurance, provide accurate information and to acknowledge different beliefs. These comments were exciting to see because they align so well with previous research I’ve been involved with, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkingaboutimmunisation.org.au/&quot;&gt;Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation&lt;/a&gt; (SKAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two quotes from participants struck a chord with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Reassurance, patience, education may help with those people that are still ‘sitting on the fence’ about vaccination.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Recognizing and acknowledging people’s beliefs, however conveying facts and not getting drawn into a discussion or arguments.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these participants were talking about an imagined measles outbreak, their perspectives have significance for how we respond to other disease threats and how we communicate effectively with diverse populations. As I write this (April 2021), the COVID-19 vaccines have begun to be rolled out in Australia. While the questions in our survey were about measles, the implications for how best to manage the threat of disease, while also communicating in an open, thoughtful and compassionate way, especially with people who might be feeling nervous about vaccinations, is timely.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We Have A Strong Urge To Find Out What Might Have Been — Even When This Leads To Feelings Of Regret</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/08/we-have-a-strong-urge-to-find-out-what-might-have-been-even-when-this-leads-to-feelings-of-regret/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AGreenburgh&quot;&gt;Anna Greenburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regret seems to be a fundamental part of the human experience. As James Baldwin wrote, “Though we would like to live without regrets, and sometimes proudly insist that we have none, this is not really possible, if only because we are mortal.” Expressions of regret are easy to find throughout the history of thought, and, as indicated in the Old Testament, intrinsic to regret is a sense of emotional pain: “God regretted making humans on earth; God’s heart was saddened”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the aversive experience of regret, traditional models of decision-making predict that people should to try to avoid it. But of course, the picture is more complex — we all have experienced the desire to know &lt;em&gt;what might have been, &lt;/em&gt;even if it leads to regret&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620963615&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led by Lily FitzGibbon at the University of Reading, finds that the lure of finding out what might have been is surprisingly enticing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41760&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across six experiments, the researchers employed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in which participants are required to inflate a computer animation of a balloon. The more they inflate the balloon, the greater the participant’s payoff — but each balloon has a randomly assigned “safe limit” above which it pops, and the participant is paid nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In each trial, participants decided how many times to pump up the balloon and were then shown the trial outcome: whether the balloon popped (“bust” trials), or remained inflated thereby giving participants a reward (“bank” trials). After this outcome was revealed, they had the opportunity to seek “counterfactual” information — that is, feedback about alternative possible outcomes; in this case, how far they could have pumped the balloon safely in the trial and how much they could have won. Importantly, as the balloons’ safe limits varied randomly across trials, this information could not help performance later on in the task. Participants were asked to rate their emotional state, from sad to happy, after learning the outcome of the trial, and indicate whether this emotional state had changed after receiving the counterfactual information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how often participants sought counterfactual information, as well as its emotional effects. They focussed their analysis on “bank” trials as these trials were expected to clearly elicit regret: counterfactual information on these trials normally signified a missed opportunity as the participant could usually have inflated the balloon more and therefore earned a higher reward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all experiments, participants seemed to experience regret in “bank” trials: they felt significantly worse after receiving counterfactual information. Unsurprisingly, the greater the missed opportunity, the worse the participants felt. But even though this information elicited regret, counterfactual curiosity was high: participants requested feedback in 46% of “bank” trials across all the main experiments, and 71% in a replication study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, participants even spent money to receive counterfactual information: although counterfactual curiosity was higher when information was free, when they had to pay for it, they still requested feedback on 18% of bank trials. Similarly, in experiments where participants needed to exert physical effort to obtain counterfactual information, they requested feedback around half the time. This underlines how difficult it is to resist the motivational pull of learning about missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The counterfactual curiosity observed in “bank” trials also had detrimental effects on participants’ performance. After receiving such feedback, participants took greater risks on subsequent trials, which had a negative effect on the number of points won, particularly when this behavioural adjustment was large. This highlights a mechanism likely relevant to gambling problems: counterfactual curiosity can exacerbate damaging gambling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many regrets in life pertain to our own mistakes made in isolation, as social beings we continually fret over interactions with others. Of course, the BART is an abstract paradigm so the study cannot speak to regrets of a more social nature. While this is a question for future research, the strength of counterfactual curiosity exposed in the paper might suggest that many of us have a morbid curiosity to seek out regret in all forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620963615&quot;&gt;The Lure of Counterfactual Curiosity: People Incur a Cost to Experience Regret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/170863&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;influential paper&lt;/a&gt; by David E. Bell considered the implications of disappointment, a psychological reaction caused by comparing an actual outcome to a more optimistic expected outcome, as in playing the lottery. Equations for regret, disappointment, elation, and satisfaction have been incorporated into economic models of financial decision-making (e.g., variants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prospect theory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial choices comprise one critical aspect of decision-making in our daily lives. There are so many choices we make every day, from the proverbial option paralysis in the cereal aisle... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGEKveX93g/YGTYpK9T9jI/AAAAAAAANSM/L1KICAqlN0kap457Oyy3-dLrGpMv746rQCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/cereal%2Baisle.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGEKveX93g/YGTYpK9T9jI/AAAAAAAANSM/L1KICAqlN0kap457Oyy3-dLrGpMv746rQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/cereal%2Baisle.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;...to decisions about who to date, where to go on vacation, whether one should take a new  job, change fields, start a business, move to a new city, get  married, get divorced, have children (or not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who to trust.

Right? Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/994181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;computational model of trust and reputation&lt;/a&gt; or a model of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hawkrobe/status/1376710875524919304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how people choose to allocate effort in social interactions&lt;/a&gt;. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm out of my element here, so this will limit my understanding of these models. Which brings me to a more familiar topic: meta-commentary on interpretation (and extrapolation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computational Decision-Making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I'm thinking  about writing a blog post entitled, &quot;Overinterpreting Computational  Models of Decision-Making&quot;. And by &quot;overinterpreting&quot; I mean claiming  results from a binary probabilistic decision-making task have  implications for individualized cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1371242065837748227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My motivation for writing this post was annoyance. And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper in &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was far more measured and sophisticated, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In probabilistic decision making, people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;often without being aware of it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unaware shall become aware. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Further advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagne et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/s856/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;381&quot; data-original-width=&quot;856&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h178/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17586866&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885654&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; (including in the authors' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730669&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own work&lt;/a&gt;). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ &lt;i&gt;but see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fried (2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) ]&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions. My snappish response to the press release concerns whether we can prescribe individualized therapies based on the differences between the yellow arrows on the left (“resilient people”) compared to the right (“internalizing people” — i.e., the anxious and depressed), given that the participants may not even realize they're learning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s709/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;709&quot; data-original-width=&quot;697&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w394-h400/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will leave it to Dr. Eiko Fried (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;) to explain whether we should accept (or reject) this bifactor model of “shared symptoms” vs. “unshared symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell DE.

	<title>BMC Series blog: The relationship between self-harm and bullying among adolescents</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/person-2244036_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is often the result of a complex interplay of genetic- biological, psychological and environmental factors. Bullying is one aspect that can increase the risk of self-harm. However not all adolescents who experience bullying harm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullies are also at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only being the victim of bullying that is related to self-harm, but also being a bully aggressor. In fact, in our study we found that adolescents who are both bullies and are bullied by their peers (the bully-victims), were the group most vulnerable to self-harm. They were six times more likely to self-harm than adolescents who weren’t bullies or bullied&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the “bully-victims” have the broadest range of adjustment problems, presenting difficulties common to both bullies and victims. An earlier study found that many of the bully-victims first have a history of being bullied, and then begin to bully peers later in adolescence. Thus, they suffer from both emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there a relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bullying victimization and self-harm are associated with emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. In our study we found that emotional problems and parental conflicts were important factors for the association between the bullied adolescents and self-harm, and between the bully-victims and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that school behavioral problems also accounted for some of the relationship between self-harm and the bullies, and self-harm and bully-victims. This confirms the idea that the act of bullying is part of a broader concept of conduct behavioral problems with aggressive and delinquent behaviors, school failure, and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental support and school well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;School well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullies and the bully-victims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we see that those who are bullied and/or bullies may be more likely to engage in self-harm, we know that not everyone who is bullied or bullies self-harms. We therefore investigated what might protect against self-harm amongst the bullies, bullied and bully-victims. We found that although parental support had a protective effect on self-harm among boys and girls in general, it was especially important for those who are bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the willingness to talk to and seek help from parents during a difficult time like bullying, may protect against self-harm among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to also find that school well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullied and the bully-victims. Our result appears to be the first to investigate the buffering effect of school well-being on bullying behavior and self-harm among adolescents. This is an important result for the prevention of self-harm. Schools, parents, and health care professionals should be aware of the importance of school well-being for adolescents who are being bullied, in terms of identifying those at risk of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequent is self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that fifteen percent of participating adolescents reported engaging in self-harm during the last year. This is consistent with earlier studies finding the 12-month prevalence rate to be between 10 to 19% around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348041/&quot;&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we used in this study was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ungdata.no/english/&quot;&gt;Ungdata&lt;/a&gt;” that is a cross-sectional, large, national survey, designed for adolescents. A total of 14 093 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, from different parts of Norway, participated in the study; this was 87% of those invited to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data was collected at one point in time and therefore we do not know if the bullying occurred prior to self-harm. However, previous longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856713001834&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that bullying increased the risk of self-harm and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we measured self-harm and bulling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured self-harm by asking if the adolescents had tried to harm them self in the past 12 months. Bullied was measured by asking adolescent if they had been teased, threatened, or frozen out by other young people in school, free time, online, or on their mobile phones. Bullying other peers was measured by asking if they had taken part in teasing, threatening or freezing out out other young people at school, free time, online or by mobile phone. We created a new variable to measure those both being bullied and who bully others (the bully-victims), by combining the variables “Bullied” and “Bullying other peers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong link between bullying and self-harm. Interventions to address bullying may reduce self-harm. Our findings also suggest that high levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm. Addressing these factors may be important in reducing the risk of self-harm among those experiencing bullying.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Supporting community needs with an enhanced code policy on PLOS Computational Biology</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/IQFg2gChmhg/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has adopted an enhanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;code sharing policy&lt;/a&gt; for all papers submitted from 30 March 2021. The change, announced in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, comes in response to community needs and support for initiatives which drive Open Science practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Community drivers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code sharing is not new to many of our authors. Research shows that 41% of papers in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; already share code voluntarily (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;Boudreau &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating the community’s willingness to make their work both rapidly available and methodologically transparent. This creates a strong foundation for implementing a stronger policy and also works towards establishing code sharing as a normal research behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; defines “open” as more than the availability of a research article. Our authors, editors, and readers see data and code sharing as tools to boost reproducibility and transparency. Sharing code alongside data will allow others to check and reproduce work and ultimately drive new discoveries. Requiring authors to share their code (unless there are good reasons not to) works towards making the research published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; as robust as possible for the benefit of the whole research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt; we sought views from researchers in the computational community on the barriers they face when sharing code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;Harney &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2021&lt;/a&gt;). We then tested our policy text with researchers to help inform its design and content. This has allowed us to respond to researcher needs, for example by allowing exemptions to the policy for those with legitimate legal or ethical constraints on sharing. In this way, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; continues to be shaped by policies the community has helped define, and Open Science values that reflect the way they want to communicate research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Open Science at PLOS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Science is one of our founding principles at PLOS. Enhancing the code sharing policy at one of our journals in response to community needs is just one step we are making to increase the adoption of Open Science practices. We aim to empower researchers to share their good practices because we believe communities are best placed to define their own needs. The computational biology community is shaping the future of research communication by leading the way in practices that make science more open and equitable for all. However, we do offer guidance and help to those who need it, for example, by detailing best practice for code sharing alongside our policy text. No matter how researchers choose to make their work Open, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; provides options to support researcher needs and the platform to influence broader change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaboration with the community and responding to their needs is part of our approach to Open Science, regardless of how that community is defined. We will be closely monitoring the reaction to the code sharing policy at &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; and exploring what an enhanced policy could mean for other communities that we serve. &lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&quot;the Committee believes that when carelessness or scientific dishonesty can be found in so many articles with so many different authors in question, there must be a lack of training and / or lack of control over data handling.

The committee believes that good routines for training are a line responsibility and can not only be attributed to group or project manager.&quot;</content:encoded>

	<title>xcorr.net: Building Neuromatch Academy</title>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2021/03/25/building-neuromatch-academy/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content&quot;&gt;Neuromatch Academy 2020&lt;/a&gt; is a three-week online summer school in computational neuroscience that took place in July of 2020. We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience – from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973&quot;&gt;we have a preprint out&lt;/a&gt;, and NMA has been covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email&quot;&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I’m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/&quot;&gt;Richard Gao wrote a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little background: my stint into teaching&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here’s my explanation of globals in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type… If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it’s a module variable. That’s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. […many rambling minutes later…]. In any case, don’t use globals if you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn’t fit with novice students’ current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner’s motivations – both intrinsic and extrinsic – and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically – at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Code in Place&lt;/a&gt;. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford – &lt;a href=&quot;https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html&quot;&gt;including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel&lt;/a&gt; – given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level – understanding what they’re stuck on, where they’re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording’s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team – Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  – working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn’t know I was ready for. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/&quot;&gt;if you’re wondering whether industry is right for you&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it’s a great place to get that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Deciding what to build&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you’re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism&quot;&gt;Heilmeier questions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much will it cost?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will it take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can answer these questions, you know what you’re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn’t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don’t foster belonging. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution risk and legal risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1500$ for each TA, and we’re aiming for 200 TAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re launching July 13th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier’s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee’s duties. The curriculum committee’s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running on enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We’re democratizing education! We’re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We’re doing something no one’s ever done! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer’s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer’s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you’re refusing to accept that gift, and that’s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step – you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There’s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done – update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in – we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://quire.io/&quot;&gt;quire&lt;/a&gt;, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It’s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running like clockwork&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen – when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7560&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7560&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image-1.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1172,463&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-1-2/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image-1.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The arcane art of the Gantt chart&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emdupre&quot;&gt;Elizabeth DuPre&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference&quot;&gt;this talk by the creator of Elm&lt;/a&gt; – in open source projects, the right culture doesn’t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. “Deadlines matter” is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you’re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can’t do that at NMA – your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. – if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran – ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me “a little German” for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I’m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&quot;&gt;It’s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism&lt;/a&gt; – we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that’s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn’t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a “good enough” version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good tools to work productively with each other&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;, Fred Brooks claims that “adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later”. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle – a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it’s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wevideo.com/&quot;&gt;WeVideo&lt;/a&gt;) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good organization to work productively with each&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don’t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student’s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That’s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It’s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel – everybody is on the same side. It’s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/&quot;&gt;This kind of design thinking&lt;/a&gt; – ship early, ship often, iterate – can be applied to all aspects of open source education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Making decisions under uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you make decisions swiftly and effectively in a big org? We had hundreds of volunteers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/9fp4v/&quot;&gt;134 authors on the curriculum paper alone&lt;/a&gt;. 134 very smart people cannot all be of the same opinion at the same time in the face of uncertainty. The first step to make decisions effectively is to separate decision making and execution. It’s very easy to leave a lot of decisions to be implicit until it’s crunch time. It happened a couple of times that I made a medium-scale decision or encouraged other people to make medium-scale decisions during a daily standup meeting. Big mistake. A lot of people affected by the decisions weren’t in the room; they felt unheard and now burdened to go to a daily meeting to stay in the loop. Don’t do that – take bigger decisions in separate planning meetings. Every software methodology has some notion of a planning meeting, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;waterfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)&quot;&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; or whatever – by the end of that meeting you should be clear about what to do for the next week or month. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that can sap a lot of energy at these meetings is having circular arguments: revisiting the same question in subsequent meetings even though you thought you had come to an agreement. Sometimes, one person thinks a decision was made, while another thinks things were still under discussion. Write down decisions in meeting notes, share them with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some orgs in the for-profit sector are hierarchical, so that disagreements get resolved top-down. That doesn’t really work in the non-profit sector, where people are there on a volunteer basis. In non-profit and in open source communities, many orgs thus use consensus-based decision making. I think pure consensus-based decision making is very difficult to get right. I’m a member of a not-for-profit makerspace that’s built on anarchist principles. We use consensus-based decision-making, and it gets rowdy: flame wars on our message board are not infrequent, whether it’s about resource allocation and who gets the space when and whose responsibility it is to take the trash out. Pure consensus-based decision making can have an insidious effect that people that are not in agreement with the majority are left isolated as “difficult” and “not a team player”. That can breed resentment, which leads to personality clashes, which leads to dysfunction: decision making grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s an alternative to pure consensus-based decision making: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit&quot;&gt;disagree and commit&lt;/a&gt;. You replace the norm that consensus must be reached with an alternative norm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;everybody’s opinion should be understood &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;decisions are made based on majority or supermajority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s ok to disagree with a decision but we all bound ourselves to the decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sure that you understand somebody’s opinion – especially an opinion you don’t agree with –  you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/&quot;&gt;Steel Man technique&lt;/a&gt;. You restate the strongest version of their argument and engage with that. Oftentimes that will resolve whatever argument you had in the first place, or prepare you to build a hybrid solution. If you don’t come to a resolution, at least everyone will understand that they have been heard and understood. Decisions can take place in realtime in a synchronous meeting, or through a polling app in Slack (if a poll, put a deadline on it so it doesn’t drag on; in either case, quorum should be reached). If somebody disagreed with the decision, the norm says that that’s good and healthy, as long as they commit to the decision like everyone, so it doesn’t breed resentment in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Be the change you wish to see&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s law&lt;/a&gt; – but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students’ intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That’s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students’ emotional needs. That’s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads – I can be a difficult person and that’s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant’s email signature):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edwin Land&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the organizers, Megan, Brad, Gunnar, Konrad, Paul, Kate, Carsen, Xaq, Aina, Athena, Eric, John, Alex, Yiota, Emma and Beth; the waxers Michael, Madineh, Ella, Matt, Richard, Jesse, Byron, Saeed, Ameet, Spiros; everybody that contributed to technical, Titipat, Jeff, Marco, Arash, Adam, Natalie, Guga, and Tara; and everyone who contributed, whether a few hours or weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: An interview with protocols.io: CEO Lenny Teytelman on partnering with PLOS</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/pgXjiPU_SWw/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our ongoing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io/&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; led to a new and exciting &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;article type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a new avenue to share research in-line with the principles of Open Science. This two-part article type gives authors the best of both platforms: protocols.io hosts the step-by-step methodology details while &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; publishes a companion article that contextualizes the study and orchestrates peer review of the material. The end result is transparent and reproducible research that can help accelerate scientific discovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read our interview with protocols.io CEO and co-founder Dr. Lenny Teytelman where he discusses what triggered the concept for the company, how researchers can benefit from this collaboration and how his team settled on such an adorable racoon logo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, what is protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It serves both researchers needing secure and private collaboration and those aiming to share their knowledge publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind protocols.io? Did you have any particular experiences or issues as a researcher that led to you believing protocol sharing was an under-supported element of the scientific community? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a year and a half of my postdoc that went into correcting just a single step of the microscopy methods that I was using. Instead of a microliter of a chemical, the step needed five, and instead of a fifteen-minute incubation with it, it needed an hour. The problem is that this isn’t a new technique but is a correction of a previously-published method. That means I didn’t get any credit for that year and a half, and everyone using this method was either getting misleading results or had to spend one or two years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering what I’d love to share with them, but didn’t have a good way of doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the experience that led to my obsession with creating a central place to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge, within research groups and companies and broadly with the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines had a need for a dedicated tool for proper method sharing… We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocols.io launched in 2014 — how were the first few years? How were you able to make yourself known and show that your product is worthwhile and secure for researchers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh, you just touched on a painful topic. I actually gave a talk at a conference in 2018, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJwKXZsmi4&quot;&gt;The harsh lessons from 4 years of community building at protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;. The first years were surprisingly rough. As an academic with zero entrepreneurial experience, I naively expected that once we build the platform, I’d tell my scientist friends that it exists, and through word of mouth, it would go viral. Turns out that it is not how new initiatives work. There is a lot of dedicated work needed to build the trust and visibility and simply let researchers know that you exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took the support of publishers, societies, funders, and Open Science and reproducibility champions to climb out of obscurity. Speaking of that support, the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between PLOS and protocols.io was critical in helping the research community learn about protocols.io.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the platform evolved since then? What elements have been consistent and what have been some major changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vision and mission have not really changed since 2014, but thanks to the constant feedback of the research community and a brilliant CTO and co-founder Alexei Stoliartchouk listening to that input, the product has grown from a rudimentary website to a powerful tool with amazing functionality to support the sharing of the method details and to help in the daily work of the researcher. For a fun comparison of where we were at launch in February 2014, take a look at our Kickstarter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1881346585/protocolsio-life-sciences-protocol-repository&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the early changes was in scope, a year after we launched. We initially thought that this is a platform for experimental wetlab scientists, but soon after launch, requests started to come to expand it to support computational/bioinformatics workflows. And then in 2017, there was another expansion in scope, catalyzed by that same 2017 partnership with PLOS. As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines needed a dedicated tool for proper method sharing. This actually led us to change our welcome page from “Repository for Life Science Methods” to “Repository for Research Methods.” We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is the new PLOS ONE Lab Protocol article type to the journey and mission of protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after our launch, when I realized that things don’t just “go viral”, I began to think a lot about incentives. It occurred to me some time in 2015 that it would be amazing if researchers had a way of turning their protocols into peer reviewed papers. I was looking at the &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; model and wondering if we could add peer review to protocols.io. The problem was that our scope was so broad, we would need thousands of academic editors to be able to support the peer review — essentially we’d have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. Then, in 2017 when we started working with PLOS, I realized, “We don’t have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;! It already exists; we just need to partner!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while this partnership is a big deal for protocols.io, I am particularly excited about it because of what it can do for reproducibility and Open Science. As I said when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-announces-two-new-peer-reviewed-article-types-for-plos-one/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with PLOS by launching this new modular article type. This will provide authors with all of the benefits of rigorous peer review, plus a dynamic and interactive platform to present their protocols, with support for videos and precise details that are important for adopting and building upon the published methods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, on the importance of Open Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS and protocols.io have similar mission statements and nearby offices: how did this collaboration with PLOS start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that our collaboration with PLOS is a consequence of me being co-advised as a graduate student by Professor Michael Eisen, co-founder of PLOS. That actually is not the case. It is true that as soon as I realized in 2012 that something like protocols.io needs to be built, I called Professor Eisen, described the idea, and said, “PLOS should build such a platform.” But he replied, “PLOS is a publisher, not a software developer. You need to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in fact, it is the Chief Science Officer of PLOS, Dr. Veronique Kiermer, who is the key early lead on the PLOS/protocols.io connection. Dr. Kiermer was the founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt; and has a passion for reproducibility and a deep appreciation for the essential role that protocols play in the research cycle. We met at an Open Access mixer in San Francisco when she had just moved to PLOS. As I showed her what we had built, she asked countless questions of “can it do this and that” and I showed her the “yes” answers right on my phone. She got excited and said, “This is exactly what I always dreamed of. We should do something together!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the COVID-19 pandemic taught you about the importance of Open Science and supporting collaborative research opportunities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stunned by the extent of rapid sharing and collaborative spirit in the research world, united against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is how you ideally imagine science working. It is how science should work. We’ve seen a remarkable level of rapid method sharing in the SARS-CoV-2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/coronavirus-method-development-community/publications?sort=views&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just the methods; researchers are sharing data, preprints, code in precisely the way that accelerates and amplifies everyone’s efforts around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am simultaneously inspired by what I see and frustrated that this isn’t yet the norm. I’ve been watching the world and publishers declare in 2015 that rapid sharing and immediate Open Access are essential for Ebola research. Then the same in 2016 for Zika. Then 2019 for all research related to the opioid crisis. In 2020 and 2021 it’s COVID-19. It’s frustrating that we make exceptions for pandemics and crises and then go back to the traditional stunted way of sharing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for protocols.io? (How can you continue to help scientists adopt Open Science activities?) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beautiful part of our growth (we have over 9,000 public protocols now and have been roughly doubling every year since our launch), is that with increased sharing and researchers on protocols.io we also have received more feedback and requests than ever. As more requests and suggestions come in, our appetite for improving and enhancing the platform only increases. It’s kind of like with research itself – each answer leads to more questions and more thirst for experiments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are also genuinely excited about the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Lab Protocols and we look forward to the first papers being published and to the future developments in this partnership. We’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus Question: How did you decide on the cute raccoon logo? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Disability, access, and the virtual conference</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jon-tyson-yIIXtxxdrUI-unsplash-744x286.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my first Zoom meeting of the pandemic, I found myself lying on the bathroom floor with my noise-cancelling headphones on, on the verge of a full-blown meltdown. As an autistic person, I’ve always been hypersensitive to noise and to visual stimuli—but I hadn’t realized that a Zoom meeting with my colleagues could cause sensory overload. The number of images on the computer screen, the amount of movement in those tiny thumb-nail images, and the speed with which the images had moved, flashed, and changed—not to mention the obtrusive noise of malfunctioning microphones and noisy, socially-distanced households—had been enough to make me physically sick. Although many people tend to assume that an online event is automatically more accessible than an in-person event (after all, people can attend without leaving their homes), this isn’t always the case. Even when online events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more accessible, one of the lessons the pandemic has reminded me of is that the act of creating disability access can fundamentally change the nature of the thing that is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing my new book, &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare and Disability Studies&lt;/em&gt;, I was interested in exploring disability access as art and in exploring disability access as a complicated (and complicating) multifaceted phenomenon. Disability access is rarely just a question of “Can someone with X impairment use Y?” but rather more often a question of “If we modify Y so that someone with X impairment can use it, how does it change the meaning, the experience, and the effect of Y?” Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible, whether the thing made accessible is a Shakespeare play (“the play’s the thing”) or a Zoom meeting. When we change the nature of the thing made accessible, we don’t just create access and inclusion for people with disabilities—we often create a new kind of experience altogether. I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities. Sometimes those new works, events, and objects bear a resemblance to the inaccessible version from which they grew. At other times, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most complex possibility, and the one most fundamentally counter-intuitive to a culture in which able-bodied and neurotypical (non-autistic) thinking are prioritized, is when creating accessibility not only fundamentally changes the nature of the thing made accessible but also causes attendees with a disability to lose something valuable. This seems counter-intuitive because stereotypical ways of thinking about disability have (falsely) taught us that disability experience does not include pleasure and that eliminating barriers to access is always an inherent and uncomplicated good. Neither of these things is true. For example, this year I’ll lead seminars at two Shakespeare conferences (the Shakespeare Association of America and the World Shakespeare Congress). Because of the pandemic, both conferences, for the first time ever, will be held completely online. However, these virtual events are more complicated for me than they originally seem, and their accessibility represents both gain and loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, both conferences will be more accessible for me in an online format. Traveling can be difficult for some autistic people (keeping in mind the effect of Zoom on my body and mind, imagine the effect of a crowded airport). I usually travel annually to the Shakespeare Association of America—but with much ado. I can’t fly alone (nor hope to navigate unfamiliar city streets or crowded hotels by myself) and so always travel with a support person. My support person is usually another Shakespearean, a kind volunteer who, after weathering the sensory travails of the airport and public transportation, will spend the conference with me. I am not independent. But also, I am never alone. Everything in my life is shared. There is a certain beauty in that. After a busy day of seminars and panels, I will lie on the hotel room bed in the fetal position, far too worn out from the crowds and the noise to do anything else, and my support person and I will gossip together with great pleasure about the intellectual goings-on of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disability, in our culture, is stereotyped as loss. Accessibility, in our culture, is deemed as always good, always a gain. It is also often misunderstood as simple and one-dimensional, as easy to understand and to explain. This year, for the first time ever, I will attend the Shakespeare Association of America without a support person. I will be independent. It is important, however, to think about the enormous cost of making the conference fully accessible to me. This act of access will fundamentally change the nature of what the conference is. The only way to make the conference fully accessible to me is for its social component, its travel component, its in-person component, to be completely removed. This represents a loss for all of the people at the conference and, ironically, also a loss for me. Because after my seminar at the 2021 Shakespeare Association of America, I won’t return to my hotel room to gossip about the intellectual goings-on of the conference with my support person. Rather, I will shut down my computer and reflect silently on the events of the conference… alone… for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Jon Tyson&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/647352848/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f03%2fjon-tyson-yIIXtxxdrUI-unsplash-744x286.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-if-covid-19-had-emerged-in-1719/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What if COVID-19 had emerged in 1719?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/was-spinoza-a-populist-long-read/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Was Spinoza a populist?

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Open Response to “Economic impact of UKRI open access policy” report</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SoB1zL-x4PY/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On February 17, 2021, FTI Consulting released the report: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FTI-Report-for-Publishers-Association-1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Economic assessment of the impact of the new Open Access policy developed by UK Research and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;” (full title) prepared for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publisher’s Association&lt;/a&gt; (PA) of the UK.  While we are not setting out to provide an extensive review and analysis of this report, we do want to generally refute the assertion that OA via the UKRI policy is economically damaging, and we’ll provide some references that support this position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Open Access and Open Research are an opportunity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FTI/PA report asserts that the impact of the new UKRI policy could lead to a loss in revenue to “UK-based journals” and have a broader negative impact on UK competitiveness, economic growth and position as a “global research hub.” This assessment appears to use impact on traditional publication models as the basis for this conclusion. A problem here, however, is that it is considering the scholarly publishing industry as somehow separate from the broader economic impact of making research open. Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/publications/publishings-contribution-to-research-and-innovation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;from the PA itself have shown that the link to the economy is much broader than this depiction. The UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap/uk-research-and-development-roadmap&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D roadmap&lt;/a&gt; clearly embraces open research and rapid open dissemination as not just good for science and health (especially during the current pandemic) but as a core part of “a world-leading system that unlocks innovation and growth throughout all parts of the economy.” Open Access enables this entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. When coupled with Open Research, it brings the additional benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913039116&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing trust in science&lt;/a&gt;, ever more important during these difficult times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Research (of which Open Access is one part) offers even greater opportunity both in terms of discovery and economic growth. For example, the European Data Portal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/the-economic-impact-of-open-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;on the economic impact of open data identifies the potential for 15.7% growth across a range of sectors – including scientific &amp;amp; technical, communication, transport, finance, health, retail and agriculture – and significant cost savings across the economy. We believe that a focus on Open Research, and all the efficiencies it brings, is worth considering for the UK economy especially in light of the combined impacts of the pandemic and Brexit (whatever one’s position on Brexit is).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Open Access is the fastest growing publishing model. A recent report from the scholarly analytics firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, shows that “in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/blog/open-access-surpasses-subscription-publication-globally-for-the-first-time/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2020 […]more outputs were published through Open Access channels than traditional subscription channels globally&lt;/a&gt;.” The report further show that the majority of the growth in OA is fueled by Gold OA, i.e. OA supported by some kind of business or sustainability model. It is ever more futile, in our opinion, to take such a critical and isolated position against UKRI policy when one can argue that OA is an outcome that will simply continue to happen. It is far more beneficial, as the policy itself proposes, to establish the UK as an early adopter, leader, and beneficiary of OA and its opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Publishers can and should lead&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of OA, the opportunities created by OA, and the desire for OA by the public and funders like UKRI, are clear. Contrary to Section 4.44 of the report, which mischaracterizes PLOS as publishing “at cost”, it is entirely possible to maintain value for authors, funders, and  institutions while operating a sustainable, surplus-generating business model. PLOS believes that publishers globally should be leading the efforts to devise and develop the next generation of business models that are able to support their operations in an Open Access context. This will, of course, require deep, and sometimes difficult, work by transitioning publishers. But we strongly believe this work is not outside the acceptable effort level of conscientious members of the scholarly publishing industry that have been aware of Open Access, and its benefits, for at least the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the UKRI for its efforts to hear from stakeholders in the scholarly  publishing community, and beyond, regarding the proposed policy. We understand it is a discussion rife with passionate viewpoints and unseen complexities, and so we would like to ensure that one point is clear: to successfully set up the most efficient,  frictionless Open Access ecosystem, we should leverage the &lt;em&gt;existing &lt;/em&gt;budgets and infrastructures of scholarly publishing but with OA as the outcome. This way, Open Access is not viewed as a destructive force, or something external and different that traditional publishers are not part of, but simply as the new way to publish and communicate research that all publishers can facilitate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–PLOS&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Update: Name change policy</title>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/03/11/update-name-change-policy/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv now offers the following name change options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes&quot;&gt;Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)&lt;/a&gt;, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to request a name change, please contact us &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/support/general_help&quot;&gt;through our user support portal&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:help@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;help@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/WKD-2021-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 11 March 2021, &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating World Kidney Day. This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the &lt;em&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and the I&lt;em&gt;nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: A Farewell to ALM, but not to article-level metrics!</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bbDdYlM7-W8/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is &lt;a href=&quot;http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altmetric.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, the data displayed on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric’s media coverage&lt;/a&gt;. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;details page&lt;/a&gt;, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely. Unfortunately, our articles will no longer display PMC usage counts, as these were aggregated by ALM and will no longer be available. We will also be removing recent tweets from articles and retiring the ALM Reports service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving forward we will continue to evaluate the presentation of metrics on our articles and look for ways to integrate even more relevant data from Altmetric into our user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12303&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/bottles-4840001_1920-300x169.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Alcohol consumption and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/&quot;&gt;its associated consequences&lt;/a&gt;, including cancers and heart disease, remain to be a major public health challenge. Investigating the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption can help determine where to target intervention resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Liverpool, Thompson and Pirmohamed, investigated the association between occupation and heavy alcohol consumption in working individuals aged 40-69 years in the UK. Thompson and Pirmohamed used the UK Biobank to recruit participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption, with jobs identified as skilled trades the most likely to be associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licensed premises, industrial cleaning process occupations, and plasterers. Whereas clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists and medical practitioners were least likely to be heavy drinkers. The authors findings help to determine which employment sectors may benefit most from health promotion programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Anesthesiology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-article-title&quot; data-test=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-021-01286-w?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020&quot;&gt;A gap existed between physicians’ perceptions and performance of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessments in Chinese intensive care units&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights the need for prompt quality improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium (PAD) management are key elements in the care of critically ill patients. However, previous research has highlighted the gap between actual clinical practices and physicians’ attitudes to PAD management. Zhou &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated the current practice of PAD assessments in Chinese ICUs by a one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12308&quot; style=&quot;width: 341px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12308&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Capture2-300x143.png&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig. 5 taken from Zhou et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the actual PAD assessment rate was suboptimal, especially with regards to delirium screening. There was a significant gap between the actual practice and the physicians’ perception of the practice. Physicians reported performing assessing pain and agitation-sedation in approximately only 20 to 25% of patients which is lower than previous reports. Therefore, the study highlights the need for prompt quality improvement and the optimization of practices of PAD management in ICUs in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have sleep disturbance and this impacts their quality of life. However, it is not yet fully understood how sleep disturbance affects the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). Kuribayashi &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a prospective study on 20 patients to investigate the relationship between FD and sleep disturbance. Patients took sleep aids for 4 weeks and filled out questionnaires before and after taking sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids and as a result, GI symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with FD were also improved. In addition, the authors concluded that the use of sleep-inducing drugs was associated with reduced pain as well as improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in FD patients. Overall the study highlights the potential benefits of sleep aids for patients with FD and sleep disturbance, although multicenter studies involving a larger number of cases are needed to further investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12305 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/jogging-2343558_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;Previous research has reported that many muscles of the trunk and lower limb were greater in sprinters than in non-sprinters. However, the specific muscles that contribute to superior sprint performance for sprinters have not been fully identified. Suga &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;examined the relationships between the trunk and lower limb muscle cross-sectional areas and sprint performance in well-trained male sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that larger absolute and relative cross-sectional areas of the psoas major and gluteus maximus correlated with better personal best 100m sprint times. Therefore, the psoas major and gluteus maximus may be specific muscles for superior sprint performance for sprinters. The study also corroborates previous studies suggesting that the hamstring may not be an important muscle for achieving superior sprint performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#tab=tab_1&quot;&gt;Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women&lt;/a&gt; globally and cytology-based (Pap smear) screening is important for early detection and treatment. Although cervical cancer screening is beneficial and can enable early detection, a positive screening result might cause psychological burden. As a result, this may influence the decision to undergo further examination and future screening for cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaka &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a randomized control trial in Japan, with the intervention being the provision of cervical cancer information and cervical cancer screening information through a leaflet. The authors aim was to evaluate whether the leaflet would help reduce psychological distress. Women who were about to undergo cervical cancer screening received hypothetical screening results either with or without a leaflet, at random. Following the intervention, psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group than in the intervention group among those who received a hypothetical positive screening result. Therefore, the authors concluded that information provision might help reduce psychological distress and recommend that cervical cancer screening programs provide participants with all relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;184&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Eye-image-1260-x-485-744x285.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene &lt;em&gt;UBE3A&lt;/em&gt;, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are &lt;em&gt;covertly conscious&lt;/em&gt;—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true&quot;&gt;dreamless sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;amp;tag=1&quot;&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, it is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot;&gt;increased by psychedelic drugs&lt;/a&gt; that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1&quot;&gt;to test this hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above technique, called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf&quot;&gt;perturbational complexity index&lt;/a&gt; or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645656224/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f02%2fEye-image-1260-x-485-744x285.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/how-can-feed-additives-enhance-forage-based-diets-of-beef-cattle-infographic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How can feed additives enhance forage-based diets of beef cattle?

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
&quot;microstates&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Announcing the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/T3NGu5QEYXA/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Author: Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce the creation of the PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;Scientific Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of active researchers with diverse perspectives to help us shape our efforts to promote Open Science, globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS, as a non-profit organization committed to empowering researchers to change research communication, cannot successfully pursue its mission without listening to the research community. We regularly survey and consult the research communities we work with, formally and informally, to guide our choices and developments. The organization’s governance, including our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/board-of-directors/&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, has always involved active researchers. And we derive great insight and advice from our continuous exchange with the academic Editors of PLOS journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to take an additional formal step and create a forum where the researchers who contribute to PLOS through different channels can interact directly with each other, and to ensure that this forum includes voices from researchers around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve created the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council, a small group of researchers who represent varied scientific and career perspectives, who will advise PLOS executive and editorial leadership on strategic questions of scientific interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Scientific Advisory Council is deliberately small–about a dozen individuals–to ensure in-depth discussions and engagement, but we’ve strived to include different disciplinary interests, career stages and geographic representation. The group includes four PLOS Board members who are themselves active researchers, two of our journals’ academic Editors-in-Chief, alongside researchers who are not formally associated with PLOS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to welcome the following members to the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council. To see their photos and full bios, please visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;page &lt;/a&gt;on our website: &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Alcohol Policies, Firearm Policies, and Suicide in the United States</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/03/01/alcohol-policies-firearm-policies-and-suicide-in-the-united-states/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/usa-1120579_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and firearms are a dangerous combination and are commonly involved in suicide in the United States. This has only increased in importance as a public health issue as alcohol drinking, firearm sales, and suicides in the United States have all increased since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. State alcohol policies and state firearm policies might impact alcohol and firearm related suicide, but it is unknown how these policies specifically relate to these suicides, or how these policies might interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess relationships between alcohol policies, firearm policies, and U.S. suicides in 2015 involving alcohol, firearms, or both. We used the Alcohol Policy Scale, previously created and validated by our team, to assess alcohol policies and the Gun Law Scorecard from Giffords Law Center to quantify firearm policies. Suicide data came from the National Violent Death Reporting System. State- and individual-level GEE Poisson and logistic regression models assessed relationships between policies and firearm- and/or alcohol-involved suicides with a 1-year lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States in 2015, alcohol and/or firearms were involved in 63.9% of suicides. Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 28% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol or firearms. Similarly, a 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 14% decrease in the rate of suicides involving firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These relationships were similar for suicides that involved alcohol and firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 52% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms. A 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 26% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we found synergistic effects between alcohol and firearm policies, such that states with restrictive policies for both alcohol and firearms had the lowest odds of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals, including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found restrictive alcohol and firearm policies to be associated with lower rates and odds of suicides involving alcohol or firearms, and alcohol and firearms and our research suggests that alcohol and firearm policies may be a promising means by which to reduce suicide. These protective relationships were particularly striking for suicides involving both alcohol and firearms as well as in the strong protective interaction between alcohol and firearm policy variables, particularly for suicides involving alcohol. These findings, taken in the context of the broader literature, also suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals (so-called ‘may issue’ laws), including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this was a cross-sectional analysis, this should be considered a hypothesis-generating study that cannot prove a causal association between alcohol or firearm policies and suicide. In future research, studies using multiple years of policy and suicide data would strengthen causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger alcohol and firearm policies are a promising means to prevent a leading and increasing cause of death in the U.S. The findings further suggest that strengthening both policy areas may have a synergistic impact on reducing suicides involving either alcohol, firearms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

Humphries' novel approach to brain exposition is built around — &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; — the spike, the electrical signal neurons use to communicate. In this magical rendition, the 2.1 second journey through the brain takes 174 pages (plus Acknowledgments and Endnotes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the entire book, so this is not a proper book review. But here's an overview of what I might expect. The Introduction is filled with  inventive prose like, “We will wander through the splendor of the richly stocked prefrontal cortex and stand in terror before the wall of noise emanating from the basal ganglia.” (p. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did You Know That Your Life Can Be Reduced To Spikes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the splendor and terror of a life reduced to spikes (p. 3):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“All told, your lifespan is about thirty-four billion billion cortical spikes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spike Drama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will I grow weary of overly dramatic interpretations of spikes? “Our spike's arrival rips open bags of molecules stored at the end of the axon, forcing their contents to be dumped into the gap, and diffuse to the other side.” (p. 29-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for me on the other side of burst vesicles are intriguing chapters on &lt;i&gt;Failure&lt;/i&gt; (dead end spikes) and &lt;i&gt;Dark Neurons&lt;/i&gt;, the numerous weirdos who remain silent while their neighbors are “screaming at the top of [their] lungs.” (p. 83). I anticipate this story like a good mystery novel with wry throwaway observations (p. 82):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Neuroimaging—functional MRI—shows us Technicolor images of the cortex, its regions lit up in a swirling riot of poorly chosen colors that make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pantone&lt;/a&gt; people cry into their tasteful coffee mugs.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s698/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;662&quot; data-original-width=&quot;698&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h303/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Pantone colors of 2021 are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 17-5104 Ultimate Gray&quot;&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 13-0647 Illuminating&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever it ends up – with a mind-blowing new vision of the brain based on spontaneous spikes, or with just another opinion on predictive coding theory – I predict &lt;i&gt;THE SPIKE&lt;/i&gt; will be an epic and entertaining journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s845/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;845&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/w379-h400/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; width=&quot;379&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Why arXiv needs a brand</title>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pop quiz: There are so many “-Xivs” online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer: only &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@arXiv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,” said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the identity project, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessed user feedback collected since 2016,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guide our branding efforts we focused on &lt;b&gt;arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science&lt;/b&gt;. After many rounds of revision and refinement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;arXiv’s first brand guide&lt;/a&gt; was produced, in addition to our new logo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and we’d like to share them with you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_948&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXiv's logo&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-948 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, &lt;strong&gt;the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo&lt;/strong&gt; captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;brand guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt; ensure that we express arXiv’s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,” said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
