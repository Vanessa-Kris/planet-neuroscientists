&lt;p&gt;It is possible to pay attention effortlessly, your mind “pulled by the inherent nature of the object of experience”. In fact, with practice, doing so can “lead you to experience inner silence, tranquility, peace and transcendence”. That’s according to a research team led by Michelle Mahone at the California School of Professional Psychology, who have published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262617300635?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Brain and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; what they describe as the first neuroimaging study of people in the midst of Transcendental Meditation (TM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 women volunteers (average age 60) had practised TM for an average of 34 years, meaning they had amassed around 36,000 hours of meditation practice. The researchers scanned the meditators’ brains while they lay resting with their eyes closed and then while they meditated for 10 minutes. The volunteers’ extensive mastery at meditation allowed them to achieve “bliss”, “deep restfulness” and “clear transcending” despite the noise and discomfort of the brain scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with rest, the scans showed that while meditating the volunteers exhibited increased activity at the front of their brains (in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus), alongside reduced activity in the cerebellum and the pons – structures at the back of the brain and in the brain stem. These latter activity reductions have not been observed in brain scan studies of other forms of meditation that involve focused attention (for example on one’s breathing) or open monitoring (paying mindful non-judgmental attention to one’s thoughts and sensations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their findings were consistent with the idea that Transcendental Meditation involves a unique form of effortless attention, in which “the attention is guided by the inherent pleasure of inner transcendence, rather than through cognitive evaluation and control”. The increase in frontal brain activity reflects the engagement with a specific experience, they said, while the minimal control required was reflected in reduced activity in the cerebellum and pons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sceptical readers may feel that the researchers are guilty of “reverse inference” – making assumptions about the meaning of the brain activity patterns that they observed. Mahone’s team said further research is needed to directly compare brain activity during different meditation practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in clinical settings shows that some people with mental health problems experience extreme distress when hearing non-speech vocal sounds, like coughs and chewing noises, a phenomenon called “misophonia”. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3387?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from Amanda Seaborne at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Logan Fiorella at the University of Georgia, published in &lt;i&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology,&lt;/i&gt; suggests that this issue exists in the broader population, and that people sensitive to these sounds perform poorly in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-two undergraduates sat in a cubicle and read a technical text about migraines for six minutes, before reporting what they remembered, answering questions on the text, and finally completing a questionnaire about their misophonia sensitivity (they rated how distressing they found sounds like “rustling papers, sneezing, chewing gum, tapping, eating crunchy foods, and heavy breathing”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;For half the participants, a nearby cubicle contained a confederate working for the researchers who chewed gum loudly throughout the experiment. Participants in this condition who scored higher on the misophonia questionnaire performed worse at the comprehension measures than lower scorers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the reverse pattern was found for the participants in the quiet control condition, with the more sound-sensitive students performing slightly better – perhaps because these conditions were the ones in which they naturally thrive. So misophonia seems to have an impact in non-clinical contexts (none of the rating scores reached clinical levels of sensitivity), although we can’t say whether its origin is in a subtle neurological difference or a psychological preoccupation. But it’s a good reminder that by honouring the expectations in designated quiet spaces, we may be helping others more than we know.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>In 1917, at the height of the Great War, a new and mysterious disease emerged into the world, before vanishing a few years later. Although it was to prove less destructive than the 1918 influenza pandemic which occured at around the same time, the new outbreak had a persistent legacy: some of the victims of the disease remained disabled decades later.

The new syndrome was first reported by Constantin von Economo, a neurologist in Vienna. He dubbed the disease 'encephalitis lethargica', after</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Do you think you are closer to your “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/22/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-true-self-but-its-still-a-useful-psychological-concept/&quot;&gt;true self&lt;/a&gt;” today than in the past? If so, is this a work in progress? Will the you of the future be even more authentic than you are today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of US psychologists recently put these kind of questions to over 250 volunteers across two studies, to find out if there is a general pattern in the way that we think about the development of our true selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting their findings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1322530&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Seto and Rebecca Schlegel found there is a tendency for us to see ourselves as becoming progressively more authentic through life. “If these reflections are at all reflective of how people feel in real time,” they concluded, “it is possible that people believe they will be the closest they have ever been to who they really are when they reach the end of their lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33692&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seto and Schlegel started out by looking at the near past, present and future. They gave 125 students (mostly 18 to 19-year-olds) a definition of the true self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your TRUE SELF is made up of the characteristics, roles, or attributes that define who you really are – even if those characteristics are different than how you sometimes act in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they asked the students to indicate how much overlap there was between their true self and their self when they graduated high school, their self today, and their self as they will be at the end of the current semester. There was a clear trend for the students to see themselves as currently closer to their true self than they were in the past, and for this closeness to their true self to increase further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, the researchers asked 134 participants recruited online (a wider age range this time of 19 to 67) to divide their entire lives – past, present and future – into chapters, to write a description for each chapter, and to rate how close their self in each chapter was to their “true self”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there was a clear trend for people to see their authenticity as having increased through time, and to expect it to progress further in the future (although there was a tapering effect, so that the largest increases in authenticity were seen in the near past, and in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seto and Schlegel said this pattern of findings is consistent with what would be expected based on the psychology of self-enhancement: this is usual our motivation – well-established by prior research – to see our current selves in a positive light, including by derogating our past selves. Most of us also tend to be unrealistically optimistic, thinking that we and life will only get better in the future. Consistent with this, the participants ratings for their happiness and meaning for each life chapter showed a similar rising trend across the lifespan. Also, higher participant self-esteem correlated with expecting to increase more in authenticity over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the findings generally didn’t tie in with what Harvard psychologists termed the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/01/14/the-end-of-history-illusion-illusion/&quot;&gt;End of History Illusion&lt;/a&gt;” five years ago, based on their finding that most of us think we’ve changed a lot in the past, but that we don’t expect to keep changing so much in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately what the new findings can’t do is answer what the researchers admit is “the most interesting question” – how people’s sense of authenticity really does vary through life. The new results suggest that overall people – at least in American culture – &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they’ve become progressively more “real”, and they expect this to continue. But to see if that’s really true we’d need a longitudinal study to take repeated measures of the same people’s feelings of authenticity over time. Stay tuned: we’ll let you know if and when such a study is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a couple of minutes, click through to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/vEARsurvey&quot;&gt;survey site&lt;/a&gt; of “noisy gifs” – brief silent movies that, for some people at least, evoke illusory sounds. If you hear a thwack when fists collide with a punchbag, or a yell while watching a man silently scream, then you’re experiencing a “visual-evoked auditory response” (vEAR), also called “hearing motion synaesthesia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after the first, preliminary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18682202&quot;&gt;journal paper&lt;/a&gt; on the phenomenon, Christopher Fassnidge and Elliot Freeman at City University, London, report – in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218300741?via=ihub&quot;&gt;paper&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cortex&lt;/i&gt; – that it’s remarkably common, affecting perhaps 20 – 30 per cent of us. Fassnidge and Freeman also investigated what induces vEAR, providing clues to what’s going on the brain.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33688&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4,000 volunteers, plus 126 paid participants, viewed 24, 5-second-long silent videos of real world scenarios and also more abstract images, such as shifting patterns. Using a scale of 0 to 5, they indicated how much auditory sensation they experienced for each video. They also answered a series of other questions, including about past experience of vEAR and of any other synaesthesias (when a perception via one sensory modality triggers a sensory perception in another modality).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the unpaid volunteers were recruited via adverts with text such as “Do you experience ‘hearing motion?’”, it’s certainly possible that there was a self-selection bias. But, on enrolment, the paid participants did not know what the study was about, so, in theory, they should be more representative of the general population. Thirty-one per cent of this paid group (an even higher percentage, in fact, than in the bigger, unpaid group) reported past experience of vEAR.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the survey results, anyone who rated half of the videos at greater than or equal to 3 was identified as experiencing vEAR. Just over 20 per cent of the paid participants fell into this category. Taken with the self reports of past experience of vEAR, the findings suggest that the phenomenon is far from rare.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher-rated videos often depicted relatively familiar events that are reliably associated with particular sounds (like fists hitting a punchbag), suggesting that an understanding of what’s happening in the scene was involved in causing the illusory sounds. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in people who reported prior experience of vEAR, even videos containing abstract flickering or moving patterns could trigger sound perceptions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fassnidge and Freeman found that these videos had high levels of raw “motion energy” (imagine a flickering neon shop sign, for instance, compared with a silent video of a person screaming, in which case there’s very little movement or “motion energy”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specific sensitivity to motion energy suggests, the researchers write, that in some people, at least, visual motion – rather than the meaning of a scene – affects auditory perceptions directly. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that participants with prior experience of vEAR were also more likely to report other synaesthesias, including seeing flashes in reaction to hearing sudden sounds in the dark, it’s possible the two phenomena are related. Synaesthesia has been associated with higher than normal cortical “excitability”, for instance, and the researchers said cortical excitability might also be involved in vEAR. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that could now be investigated, the researchers write, before concluding: “Given the prevalence of visual-evoked auditory sensations and our new ability to quantify and correlate them, a potentially broad class of related subjective audiovisual phenomena have now become more accessible to scientific study.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To punch holes in a scientific claim, it’s legitimate to critique the supporting evidence, or query the way the evidence has been interpreted. More questionable is to throw dirt on the character or capability of the researcher making the claim. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192025&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One &lt;/i&gt;explores&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the effectiveness of ad hominem attacks against scientists and shows that some are more damaging than others.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33675&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Barnes of Montana State University and his team asked around 500 undergraduate students to review a number of scientific claims, each attributed to a named researcher, such as “Dr Martinez”. The claims were either obscure or invented, to avoid hot-button issues where the participants might already have strong immovable views (e.g. “According to Dr. Martinez at the University of Oklahoma, dibutylphthalate, a chemical used in Gold Bond foot powder, decreases the risk of some kinds of cancer”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the claims came with additional information that was either neutral (it didn’t challenge the claim) or that critiqued the researcher (ad hominem attacks) or the science behind his or her claim (e.g. pointing out issues with the supporting study itself, like the lack of a control group).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad hominem attacks either referred to past misconduct, like fabrication of previous data, conflict of interest (e.g. financed by a drug company with interests in the finding), education (e.g. low standards at the university from which he got a degree), or reports of sloppiness from his or her peers. One final type of criticism pointed at both the researcher and the study, for example an investigation that suggested he or she had fabricated this particular dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated how much faith they held in each scientific claim. Ad hominems involving education and sloppiness did not sway participants from the default level of support that they showed when the claim was presented without criticism. But a conflict of interest or past misconduct lowered faith in the claim just as much as hearing about faults in the research supporting the claim.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, personal allegations of vested interest or past misconduct were just as damning as hearing that the researcher was implicated specifically in falsifying &lt;i&gt;the very&lt;/i&gt; research that supported the claim they were making. It seems that participants could forgive suggestions that a researcher was not top-notch, but suspicions about their past motives and integrity were sufficient to pour cold water on their claims. This pattern was replicated in a sample of around 200 non-students with a wider age range (23-83, mean 49 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One criticism of the new findings is the abstract measure of participants’ faith in the claims (rather asking whether they would act on the claims, for instance). But previous use of the same paradigm has shown that this measure predicts more concrete intentions, like which of two prescription drugs a participant says they would personally use. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an ad hominem attack is considered a logical fallacy, the participants’ reactions in the new research are not strictly speaking illogical: if someone has cheated in the past, it may be reasonable for that to colour your view of their current work. Barnes and his team expected that this would especially be the case when the allegations of bad behaviour pertained specifically to the evidence underlying a researcher’s claims – but in fact the findings suggest that any allegations of past bad behavior, whether directly relevant or not, made a researcher’s claims appear equally suspect.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong effect of the conflict of interest ad hominem is also worth noting. It’s reasonably easy for critics to allege or imply a conflict of interest, especially for those willing to entertain a conspiratorial perspective. This may explain why groups hostile to scientific developments, such as vaccination, put such weight on these issues – because it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192025&quot;&gt;The effect of ad hominem attacks on the evaluation of claims promoted by scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic neuroscience teaches us how individual brain cells communicate with each other, like neighbours chatting over the garden fence. This is a vital part of brain function. Increasingly however neuroscientists are zooming out and studying the information processing that happens within and between neural networks across the entire brain, more akin to the complex flow of digital information constantly pulsing around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led them to realise the importance of what they call “brain entropy” – intense complexity and irregular variability in brain activity from one moment to the next, also marked by greater long-distance correlations in neural activity. Greater entropy, up to a point, is indicative of more information processing capacity, as opposed to low entropy – characterised by orderliness and repetition – which is seen when we are in a deep sleep or coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21008-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; is the first to examine whether and how ingesting a psychostimulant – in this case caffeine – affects brain entropy. The results show caffeine causes a widespread increase in cerebral entropy. This dose of neural anarchy is probably welcome, especially considered in light of another new &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191582&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, which finds greater brain entropy correlates with higher verbal IQ and reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33665&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the caffeine study, Da Chang at Hangzhou Normal University in China and other researchers scanned the brains of 60 participants – 30 men and women – at baseline, and also after they ingested a 200mg caffeine pill (roughly approximate to two cups of coffee). It was a “resting-state” scan meaning that the participants simply lay in the scanner doing nothing. For both scans, Chang’s team analysed changing neural activity levels from one moment to the next, and looked for correlations in activity across and within brain regions to calculate brain entropy. They also measured changes in cerebral blood flow across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scans showed that caffeine increased brain entropy across nearly the entire cerebral cortex, but especially in “lateral prefrontal cortex, the DMN [default mode network, involving in day-dreaming and self-reflection], visual cortex, and motor network”, which the researchers linked to caffeine’s known beneficial effects on “attention, vigilance, and action/motion function.” There was little correlation locally between increased entropy and cerebral blood flow (which was reduced by caffeine), suggesting the effects of the caffeine were via influences on neuronal function, rather than due to vascular changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Increased resting brain entropy indicates increased resting brain activity irregularity or complexity, suggesting an increase of information processing capacity in the resting brain,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a separate group led by Glenn Saxe at New York University’s School of Medicine used the same methods as Chang’s team to measure brain entropy in 900 healthy participants, who also completed measures of their verbal intelligence and reasoning ability outside of the scanner. The New York researchers defined brain entropy as “a measure of the brain’s overall flexibility or readiness to encounter unpredictable stimuli” and they found that it correlated with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, superior vocabulary performance was associated with greater resting-state entropy in the left inferior frontal lobe, while superior reasoning ability was associated with greater entropy in that same region, but also in bilateral prefrontal areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxe and his colleagues said that “entropy in this context provides an indicator of the brain’s general readiness to process unpredictable stimuli from the environment” – a brain with greater entropy may in effect be better able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787&quot;&gt;model and predict the outcomes of a complex, chaotic world&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers added, though, that they had not measured “the active use of brain states during a particular task”. Indeed, follow up research is now needed to see how brain entropy varies during performance of specific mental challenges, and how caffeine and other substances might affect entropy during such tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the entropy–intelligence association, participants’ age and years of education did not correlate with their IQ test scores. “These results suggest that entropy is a reliable predictor of intelligence, and provides unique information not captured by developmental status and educational status alone,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research measuring neural entropy that’s shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24183857&quot;&gt;entropy is reduced in adults diagnosed with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654848&quot;&gt;in people addicted to cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. However, the story is not as simple as more entropy is good, less is bad. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095146&quot;&gt;patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have greater neural entropy&lt;/a&gt; than healthy controls, perhaps indicative of “an underlying dysregulation of more complex functional networks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the research on neural entropy develops in the future. For now, it is enough to marvel that as you enjoy your morning coffee, you are increasing the entropy throughout your brain – the bitter tonic is not merely waking you up, but apparently also boosting your brain’s useful anarchy, its complexity and information processing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21008-6&quot;&gt;Caffeine Caused a Widespread Increase of Resting Brain Entropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While it might seem like a tiresome administrative job, setting the budget has a big influence on your chances of success – both in terms of winning the funding and administering the project successfully.  It’s also an area where junior PIs are offered little or no guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with a few definitions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant budgets are often divided into &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; costs.  In a nutshell, direct costs are for things that just wouldn’t happen without the grant – wages for dedicated staff in new posts, paying participants for their time, the cost of any questionnaires or other materials you’re using. Indirect costs are contributions to things which would be paid anyway – like a portion of the time of an existing member of staff. You might cost for 5% of the salary of a technician, or senior advisor, which should equate to them spending a couple of hours per week on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key phrase is Full Economic Costing, or FEC (don’t smirk). This is when a funder pays for various &lt;em&gt;indirect costs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;estates costs&lt;/em&gt; linked to your grant.  For example, a University provides buildings with heating and electricity, furniture and IT support, kitchens and meeting rooms. Staff on your grant will have access to a library and various support services.  All of these cost money and FEC is a way to assign some of that cost to incoming grants.  Not all funders cover FEC (e.g. charities tend not to, but UK research councils do make a contribution). Warning: FEC is always way more than you think. It can as much as double the cost of a single member of staff. So if there is an upper limit on what you can apply for, and FEC is included in this, you need to rein in your plans for what you’ll spend on equipment or post-doc salaries. Seek advice early on from a grants officer (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgeting basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re going to want to start with a nice Excel spreadsheet or similar – ask a colleague if they have an old one you can use as a template. It might be that your department has a financial administrator that can send you an up-to-date one – Universities have a habit of changing the details of how costs are calculated. Once you have your template, it can be easiest at the start to break down costs by activity – so you list all the participant payment, questionnaires, and travel costs associated with Study 1, Study 2 etc. However, when you submit your budget to the funder, you will want to group them by category.  All the travel costs will get summed together, and all the ‘consumables’ (anything that gets used once and can’t be used again – like postage or IQ-test forms – as distinct from “equipment” which can be re-used, like a laptop) will be in a different total. So make sure you label each cost according to type and then you can easily re-order your file and get the totals you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each funder asks for costs organised in subtly different ways too.  They might want them broken down by year of the project, or use particular headings. EU funding want salary costs organised into “person-hours” which are utterly fiendish. Some funders might define “equipment” as only things that cost £2000 or more.  Others might pay for salaries but only allow them to be a certain proportion of the total budget. Check these constraints at the start and make sure you label and organise your budget accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting support and approval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key thing to check up front is the relevant permissions you need to go through, in your host institution. At the University of Cambridge (and probably others), certain forms may need submitting weeks in advance (sometimes months), and in many cases these will need some details from your budget. Check this out well in advance to avoid stress. Salaries in particular will need to be aligned with your institution’s pay-scales.  You should have a conversation with someone – probably a grants officer in your department – about the right pay grade to cost for a research assistant with a Masters degree, versus a lab technician, versus a post-doc. Don’t cost at the bottom point of the grade for a new post that you are going to advertise – costing at the middle or top of a grade range will give you freedom to negotiate with the applicant and offer an attractive salary. Normally the amount you should put in your budget for, say, a two-year full time post-doc, will be provided by the grants officer. You don’t just google it like Sue did with her first ever grant! Get the ballpark figures early on so you know what you’ve got to play with in the total budget. And always remember that your grants officer is being constantly bombarded with requests for costs, often at very short notice.  Contact them early on, keep them in the loop, and agree a rough timeline for preparing the application as partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some funders only cover partial costs for large items of equipment.  Others won’t pay salary contributions for existing staff but will pay for teaching “buy out”.  This is when a grant will pay the salary of someone (normally at a mid-level pay grade) to replace the time that a senior lecturer or professor might otherwise have spent teaching.  This frees-up the Prof to help with your grant, while costing the original funder a lot less. If you have these sorts of constraints on the funding, make sure you understand them and, crucially, try to get something in writing from your department to guarantee that they will comply with the grant terms and provide any top-up funding you will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costing staff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff will normally be the biggest cost. If you’re applying for a Fellowship you’ll probably be requesting your full-time salary and maybe a %FTE (full-time equivalent: 20% FTE = one working day per week) for a senior colleague. A contribution to the time of a department administrator is also a great idea if there’s someone available, and you will have tasks for them – they could run expenses claims, book travel and monitor your budgets, saving you valuable time that you’d rather spend on science. Try not to ask for favours or trade authorship on articles for work – if you can, pay for things like specialist statistics and programming support, or for access to an assessment space. Otherwise, if the project gets funded, you are potentially beholden to others’ goodwill and availability to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also employ a research assistant or post-doc. Think carefully about the kind of skills you need, the level of independence you want from your staff, and the number of days per week you need them.  While it might seem like having someone more experienced is always a good thing, actually recruiting a research assistant with a good Masters degree is much better if you have a tightly-defined project and want someone to just get on with it. Post-docs, and PhD students, will have agendas that extend beyond the goals of your project.  While we don’t mean to suggest you shouldn’t also be offering an RA career-development opportunities and intellectual input to the work, their career stage means that just by recruiting participants, collecting and analysing data they are building and extending their skills. You need a good match between what you’re asking your employees to do, what they already know, and what they are ready to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else should I ask for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other big costs will be conferences, including travel, registration, accommodation – budget generously for these and try to specify the meetings so the reviewers can see you have considered carefully the appropriate place to share your findings.  Don’t just cost for you to attend – bring your team along too, or at least give each of them one chance to attend a scientific meeting. Another way to support your staff is to ensure you cost for some training expenses – obviously these need to be relevant to the project but it also means they will finish their time working with you with more skills than when they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to cost for a study advisory board including community representatives – their travel to meetings, some good quality catering, maybe a stipend. If you think this is overkill or too expensive for your project, you can at least cost an “honorarium” (one-off payment) for one or two consultants to advise on your work. Sue pays autistic consultants on all new autism projects now, normally aiming for £500 per year for about ten “contact points”.  A contact point might be commenting on documents by email, attending a meeting to design the methods, or advising on recruitment pathways. Be generous in your funds for participant reimbursement too, normally estimated as an hourly rate with extra for their travel costs. For children, budget for a box of gifts that they can choose from at the end of an assessment session. If working with charities or schools you might want to include a one-off gift to the organisation. If doing an online survey you can offer a prize draw, which increases response rates without pushing your budget through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t neglect the impact costs either.  Open access fees for journal articles are important – though some funders like the Wellcome Trust cover these for you under a separate budget. If you want to reach out to stakeholders with your results think about costing for a graphic designer, professional printing, or an animator to help you share your findings creatively. Budget generously for dissemination events – you don’t want your exciting ideas buried because of a lack of resources. Funders are becoming increasingly suspicious of researchers promising the world in terms of impact, but with no budget attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about cost effectiveness? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grant should be cost-effective.  Reviewers will be specifically asked whether they think your work represents good value for money. This doesn’t mean though that you should just cut cut cut. An under-funded project is a big risk and reviewers and funding committees will be reluctant to support something that doesn’t seem appropriately resourced. On the other hand, if you want multiple staff, or large items of new equipment you will need to properly justify these.  In the case of staff, you should be able to describe their responsibilities and these should clearly match to their proposed pay-grade and full or part-time hours. An easy way to save costs if you need to is to ask whether you need staff for the entire duration of the project – can you set it up yourself and just employ an RA when data collection begins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of equipment, if you are buying large and expensive items, reviewers might well ask themselves why your department doesn’t have these already, and whether you know how to use them properly. Tackle these concerns head on – maybe you have tons of EEG experience, but you need brand new kit because you’re going to be working with infants for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful grant application requires so much more than a good research idea. Your costs are a key way to show that you have thought about the practical aspects of your research.  You have a clear plan, appropriately resourced. By costing for community consultants, open access fees, or staff conference attendance, you show the reviewers your commitment to ethical science and good lab management. Budgeting your research should be an integral part of a funding application process so don’t leave it as a final afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be thorough. Be practical. Be a good scientist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The format was four talks by prominent experts in (1) the complexity of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.brandeis.edu/marderlab/research/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neural circuits and neuromodulation&lt;/a&gt; in invertebrates; (2) &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.uvic.ca/~afyshe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;computational linguistics and machine learning&lt;/a&gt;; (3) human neuroimaging/&lt;a href=&quot;http://gallantlab.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the next wave in cognitive and computational neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;; and (4) language learning/&lt;a href=&quot;https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/04/10/nyu-gary-marcus-artificial-intelligence-contrarian/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AI contrarianism&lt;/a&gt;. These were followed by a lively panel discussion and a Q&amp;amp;A session with the audience. &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;I suggested this last year, but I can't claim it had any influence...IDK&quot;&gt;What a great format!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We already knew the general answer before anyone started speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gallantlab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gallantlab&lt;/a&gt; &quot;This debate is silly&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNS2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CNS2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cpT7tKI0xa&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/cpT7tKI0xa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— CNS News (@CogNeuroNews) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CogNeuroNews/status/977643988026118148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I believe that &lt;b&gt;Dr. Eve Marder&lt;/b&gt;, the first speaker, posed the greatest challenges to the field of cognitive neuroscience, objections that went mostly unaddressed by the other speakers. Her talk was a treasure trove of quotable witticisms (paraphrased):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much ambiguity can you live with in your attempt to understand the brain? For me I get uncomfortable with anything more than 100 neurons &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're looking for optimization (in&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;[biological]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; neural networks), YOU ARE DELUSIONAL!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(18)30064-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Normal variability can be used to decode different neural pathways that can sustain the same task&quot;&gt;Degenerate mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; produce the same changes in behavior, even in a 5 neuron network...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;..so Cognitive Neuroscientists should be VERY WORRIED&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Nightmares for Cognitive Neuroscientists: Modulation of a Single Neuron Has State-Dependent Actions on Circuit Dynamics (Gutierrez &amp;amp; Marder) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/trAHVbIFd4&quot;&gt;https://t.co/trAHVbIFd4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNS2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CNS2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nsYHiS5dxv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nsYHiS5dxv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— The Neurocritic (@neurocritic) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neurocritic/status/977769790000521216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Marder started her talk by expressing puzzlement about why she would be asked to speak on such a panel, but she gamely agreed. She initially expressed some ideas that almost everyone endorses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good connectivity data is essential&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simultaneous recordings from many neurons is a good idea&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;[&lt;i&gt;but how many is enough?&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;But then she turned to the nightmare of trying to understand large-scale brain networks, as is the fashion these days in human fMRI and connectivity studies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's not clear what changes when circuits get big&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assuming a “return to baseline” is always hiding a change that can be cryptic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the optimization issue... nervous systems can't optimize for one situation if it makes them unable to deal with other &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[unexpected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does degeneracy relieve the tyranny?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;No one knows... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Marder was also a speaker at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gias.nyu.edu/canonical-computation-brains-machines-2018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canonical Computation in Brains and Machines&lt;/a&gt; meeting in mid-March (h/t &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neuroecology/status/974795579216809985&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@neuroecology&lt;/a&gt;), and her talk from that conference is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW3h6s1u3Fw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the talks from the present symposium will be on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNS YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel as well, and I'll update the post if/when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of canonical computation, now I know why Gary Marcus was apoplectic at the thought of “one canonical cortical circuit to rule them all.” More on that in a moment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next speaker was &lt;b&gt;Dr. Alona Fyshe&lt;/b&gt;, who spoke about computational vision. MLE, MAP, ImageNet, CNNs. I'm afraid I can't enlighten you here. Like everyone else, she thought theory vs. data is a false dichotomy. Her memorable tag line was “Kill Your Darlings.” At first I thought this meant delete your best line &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[of code? of your paper?]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but in reality “our theories need to be flexible enough to adapt to data” (always follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2018&amp;amp;src=typd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@vukovicnikola #cns2018&lt;/a&gt; for the best real-time conference coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up was &lt;b&gt;Dr. Gary Marcus&lt;/b&gt;, who started out endorsing the famous Jonas and Kording (2017) paper &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; which suggested that current data analysis methods in neuroscience are inadequate for producing a true understanding of the brain. Later, during the discussion, Dr. Jack Gallant quipped that the title of that paper should have been “Neuroscience is Hard” (on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/977711252255461376&quot;&gt;@KordingLab&lt;/a&gt; thought this was unfair). For that matter, Gallant told Marcus, “I think you just don't like the brain.” &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Gallant is big on data, but not mindlessly]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9lWyC32JJc/WslXt00w69I/AAAAAAAAMgw/OK1M4BJtkqUxLsjwK5hySBpytDkp_I8HwCLcBGAs/s1600/Jonas%2Band%2BKording%2527s%2Bconclusions.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;630&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9lWyC32JJc/WslXt00w69I/AAAAAAAAMgw/OK1M4BJtkqUxLsjwK5hySBpytDkp_I8HwCLcBGAs/s400/Jonas%2Band%2BKording%2527s%2Bconclusions.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;image via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vukovicnikola/status/977639849019789312&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@vukovicnikola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sparked a lively debate during the panel discussion and the Q&amp;amp;A. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to Marcus. “Parsimony is a false god,” he  said. I've long agreed with this sentiment, especially when it comes to  the brain &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the simplest explanation isn't always true. Marcus is pessimistic that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep learning&lt;/a&gt;  will lead to great advances in explaining neural systems (or AI). It's  that pesky canonical computation again. The cerebral cortex (and the  computations it performs) isn't uniform across regions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/551.long&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marcus et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is not a new idea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In my ancient dissertation, I cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016622369090082L&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Is the cerebral cortex modular?&quot;&gt;Swindale (1990)&lt;/a&gt; and said: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Swindale  (1990) argues that the idea of mini-columns and macro-columns was drawn  on insufficient data. Instead, the diversity of cell types in different  cortical areas may result in more varied and complex organization  schemes which would adequately reflect the different types of  information stored there &lt;i&gt;[updated version would be &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;“types of computations performed there&lt;/i&gt;”].&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, &lt;b&gt;Dr. Jack Gallant&lt;/b&gt; came out of the gate saying the entire debate is silly, and that we need both theory &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; data. But he also thinks it's silly that we'll get there with theory alone. We need to build better measurement tools, stop faulty analysis practices, and develop improved experimental paradigms. He clearly favors the collection of more data, but in a refined way. For the moment, collect large rich naturalistic data sets using existing technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, kids, “the brain is a horror show of maps.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNWVpDTb7Zo/WslyO_6wS5I/AAAAAAAAMhA/CZurNJBKfTwCKKFS2nlSR1TdOrPnTW1gQCLcBGAs/s1600/the%2Bbrain%2Bis%2Ba%2Bhorror%2Bshow%2Bof%2Bmaps.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;648&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNWVpDTb7Zo/WslyO_6wS5I/AAAAAAAAMhA/CZurNJBKfTwCKKFS2nlSR1TdOrPnTW1gQCLcBGAs/s400/the%2Bbrain%2Bis%2Ba%2Bhorror%2Bshow%2Bof%2Bmaps.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; image via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vukovicnikola/status/977645728192520192&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@vukovicnikola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Big Data AND Big Theory: Everyone Agrees&lt;/u&gt; (sorta)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eve Marder&lt;/b&gt; – The Important of the Small for Understanding the Big&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alona Fyshe&lt;/b&gt; – Data Driven Everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gary Marcus&lt;/b&gt; – Neuroscience, Deep Learning, and the Urgent Need for an Enriched Set of Computational Primitives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Gallant&lt;/b&gt; – Which Presents the Biggest Obstacle to Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience Today: Lack of Theory or Lack of Data?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RqHURR6NCRw/Wsj7V1jJwjI/AAAAAAAAMgc/R6JCgfW5PGQhwLmfe5DqazYF-J1QqUJvACLcBGAs/s1600/Gallant%2Bvs.%2BMarcus%2Bby%2B%2540CogNeuroNews.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;549&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RqHURR6NCRw/Wsj7V1jJwjI/AAAAAAAAMgc/R6JCgfW5PGQhwLmfe5DqazYF-J1QqUJvACLcBGAs/s400/Gallant%2Bvs.%2BMarcus%2Bby%2B%2540CogNeuroNews.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gary Marcus talking over Jack Gallant.

At our current state of knowledge, a number of different conceptual frameworks can be overlaid on the existing data to derive an order that may not be there. Or conversely, the data can be made to fit into one's larger theoretical view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

	<title>The Spike: Empirical Enactivism: How our brains simulate the world in order to experiment on the future</title>
	<link>https://medium.com/the-spike/empirical-enactivism-613aefe38391?source=rss----c92c31591e3a---4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9D_ECdAjMlKxmUvyA85klg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A single cognitive strategy might help brains do everything from resolving visual ambiguity, empathizing with others, and performing strategic planning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“the brains of each one of us does literally create his or her own world” — J Z Young (1951)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to take the view of generative predictive models illustrated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/generative-predictive-models-f39eb8f10584&quot;&gt;previous post &lt;/a&gt;and add a new perspective that I find unreasonably compelling: cognition as simulation. This idea is tightly linked to several models of cognition including predictive coding, embodied cognition, and enactivism, among others. For simplicity, I’ll refer to the ideas presented here simply as enactivism. My goal is to visually present the most compelling aspects of this family of ideas, and then speculate (likely with excessive optimism) on just how far it can take us in explaining many aspects of what our brains do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, here’s the key idea: &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;brains build complex models of the world around us capable of producing accurate simulations of both unperceived aspects of the present, and not yet perceived aspects of (multiple) potential futures. &lt;/strong&gt;I want to argue that these simulations are not one tool in the cognitive shed that can be pulled out whenever complex strategic problems surface, but rather operate continuously and directly compose cognitive tasks from the lowest subconscious levels such as scanning a visual scene, to the highest forms of social awareness.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding how these simulations are created, updated, and leveraged for decision-making may give us insights into an array of functions which we know to be key to human intelligence, such as causal induction, prediction, planning, and even empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/generative-predictive-models-f39eb8f10584&quot;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; I suggested that, according to one theory of cognition, our brains continuously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify and represent increasingly abstract patterns in sensory input&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a model of the world that generates downward flowing predictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculate prediction errors to correct the model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will make these ideas ‘enactive’ by highlighting the adaptive benefits for a living thing able to model its own physical agency, that is, the way the world responds to its actions. We will start by looking at affordances as building blocks of an enactive environment and see how they may aid the identification of causes and structure in ambiguous input. We’ll then reframe prediction as simulation and test the extent to which this concept can shed light on a range of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Windowless Control Room: The Challenge of the Infant Brain&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking &lt;/em&gt;[Ch 23]&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Daniel Dennett poses a thought experiment that I frequently come back to as fuel for intuition about the brain’s daunting task. It goes like this. One day, instead of in your own bed you wake up in a small windowless room. Two of the walls are covered in thousands of lights blinking seemingly randomly, and the opposite two walls are covered in equally many buttons, none of them labeled. A note informs you that you’re in the head of a large robot, and warns you to be careful, because the robot’s home is full of hazards that could kill it (and you) if you make a mistake. But don’t worry! The lights on the wall are connected to thousands of sensors, cameras, etc on the robot’s body, and each button controls some actuator or behavior (like moving a leg or arm, or turning the robot’s head).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uCF66QojWMaOa0MBzW7jmA.png&quot; /&gt;Inside the robot brain.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this thought experiment, you (as a personified stand-in for an infant’s brain) must somehow learn how to choose actions to make your way through the world. The problem this illustrates is that, as stated, the task is impossible: though you may notice some patterns in the lights (groupings, repeating series, even regularities that look like causal relationships) you have no direct access to the outside world (no window), and as such there’s no way to identify when the robot is in the vicinity of good things, or bad things, when it’s hanging precariously close to a cliff, or when a useful object lies in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine how much the problem changes if we say that one of those lights among the thousands glows green (while the others are red), and our note tells us that this light indicates that the robot is experiencing reward — something good is happening. Intuitively, this feels a bit more tractable since we now have a starting point, a single dimension which we can use to provide a context of valence (good thing/bad thing) to patterns we notice in the other lights. That said, this remains an incredibly challenging problem requiring our brains to develop a system to ‘understand’ the world in sufficient detail to aptly move within it, all without ever directly ‘seeing’ itself or its environment. Our best evidence that this questionably feasible problem is solvable is that each of us did survive infancy, and whatever the solution might be, we benefit from our brain’s implementation of it every millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Active Transformations as Affordances&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affordance is a concept from psychology that, if familiar, probably came to you via the world of user experience design, where it has become ubiquitous (and more than a little jargon-y). Defined by the concept’s originator JJ Gibson: “The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill… It implies the &lt;em&gt;complementarity of the animal and the environment&lt;/em&gt;.” [Gibson 1979]. In enactivism, the internal representation of such opportunities for interaction play a critical role. We will expand the definition accordingly: enactive affordances are cognitive modules that have learned to both &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;facilitate&lt;/em&gt; transitions in sensory input, whether we physically cause these transitions or simply observe them in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can think of enactive affordances as being grouped into two species: motor affordances learn contextualized transitions realized by motor commands, while hidden affordances learn sensory transitions realized by external causes in the world. There are two types of sensory information that it is here useful to distinguish: exteroception (sensitivity to stimuli originating outside of the body), and interoception (sensitivity to stimuli originating inside of the body such as affective/emotional responses). A button affords (in the motor sense) pushing, ie &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can push the button to realize the transformation &lt;em&gt;Button.Off&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;Button.On&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, a dog affords (in the hidden, external sense) barking, ie the dog may (of its own volition) bark, which has an immediate impact on the sensory environment: &lt;em&gt;Noise.Quiet&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;Noise.Barking. &lt;/em&gt;Though it is sometimes easier to think about these exteroceptive transitions, a given enactive affordance can learn transitions of either type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8J_lnQDZMRiEdYV2GzWXFw.gif&quot; /&gt;Recruiting affordances: learning to perceive and generate perceptual transitions in the world. Left: the motor affordance ‘push’ learns the transition from B&lt;em&gt;utton&lt;/em&gt;.Off to Button.On. Right: the hidden affordance ‘bark’ learns the transition from Noise.Quiet to Noise.Barking.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider how such afforded transitions might be learned and imagine the grid of lights from Dennett’s thought experiment. Since we are told these lights indicate sensed information from the environment, we expect there to be structure in the signal (both spatial: groups of lights that are often on simultaneously, and temporal: relationships in which one group of lights frequently turns on after another). Assume you noticed that a group of lights (which we’ll call S1) is often (but not always) followed by another group (which we’ll call S2). Imagine now that you notice a third group of lights that appears to predict whether S1 will be followed by S2. You might infer that this third group (illustrated as P or B above) is responsible for (a cause of) the transition S1 → S2. If, as in the ‘Push’ example, P is linked to the motor system, you have just learned to detect a useful affordance: in the present context, when perceiving S1, if I take action P, I’ll perceive S2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ll see shortly, the exact same networks that detect such afforded perceptual transitions may themselves allow the brain to generate the perception of (ie simulate) the transition, regardless of the state of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context: Maps of Associated Affordances&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key ideas behind enactivist theories is that these affordances are the building blocks of our perceptive environment: we do not perceive individual features or discrete objects, only the opportunities for action they offer. When we view an object in a particular state our brains automatically present us with several, or perhaps a multitude of possible states that could be achieved via our learned affordances. As we take action we move into new hierarchical contexts and our affordance repertoire is updated as well, offering a new set of possibilities for bringing the capabilities of our motor system in line with the external world. The result might be visualized as a map, or more formally, a graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/782/1*vulNry9NKspEK0umY9rAjA.gif&quot; /&gt;A simple robot living in a trivial ‘ring world’, by learning affordances in a given context, can generate an internal map useful for prediction, and perhaps action selection.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above we can see a trivial case of such an affordance map, that of a robot in a ring world. It can rotate left and right to move between three visual states (red, green, and blue). Having learned the simple dynamics of this world, when the robot perceives red, this map indicates that two affordances are available: the robot can change its state in the world to perceive green (by turning left), or blue (by turning right). In this illustration, only an overt action (actually turning either right or left) can produce the visual transformation. The concept of an affordance map becomes much more useful when we consider how this relates to prediction, and hence simulation. Our robot, even with a trivial cognitive capability that can be fully represented in the four nodes at left, ‘knows’ something about the world, e.g., it can predict its future from its present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Simulation &amp;amp; Active Inference&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post I framed the problem of causal induction (identifying the right cause based on the data currently available) as one of pattern recognition, generation of predicted sensory inputs, and finally a calculation of prediction error when the input disagrees with the expectation. Here I want to suggest a subtle adjustment to this perspective which I alluded to before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it has learned a causal graph, a group of enactive affordances, our brain can realize a powerful tactic: each affordance can be inverted to simulate its effects, and by doing so not just predict but &lt;em&gt;simulate&lt;/em&gt; the future. In the absence of sensory contradiction the generative simulation is allowed to run forward under its own power. And even more usefully, we are not limited to a single passive projection of what’s likely to happen next, we can leverage our array of cognitive and motor affordances to simulate &lt;em&gt;multiple &lt;/em&gt;futures, each unfolding probabilistic step after probabilistic step as a result of a different contingency, and each with a distinct expected sensory result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty (and surrealism) of the representation suggested here is that our brains both model and experience every aspect of the world with the only raw materials available: there is no light, no sound, just billions of networked neurons. Within this representation, our brains don’t need to wait for the dog to jump, they can imagine it; we don’t need to grab a scalding pot handle, we can activate the &lt;em&gt;Handle.Grab&lt;/em&gt; affordance prior to action and physically experience a low level simulation of the (painful) interoceptive results. It’s easy to allow the misnomer of ‘imagination’ to fool us here — there is no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_theater&quot;&gt;theater&lt;/a&gt; in the brain to project dramatized images of reality for some intelligent decider to act upon — the experience of the simulation is made of the exact same stuff as the physical (grounded) sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simulations are a new look at the generative piece of the generative predictive model, and seeing them as such will help illustrate the immense functional benefits of simulation within this theory of empirical enactivism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“When used in the forward direction (from action to outcome), these associations permit the prediction of the sensory consequences of possible actions. When used in the backward direction (from outcome to action), the implicit mapping enables the selection of an action that produces the (desired) consequences.” —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779150/&quot;&gt; Pezzulo et al 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our simulations are things of change — we do not model and investigate frozen worlds — they unfold temporally in parallel with (but importantly not constrained by) our perception of time. This cognitive strategy can, like a DJ with a turntable, run simulations faster than physics allows; it can skip the predictable nodes in the affordance map and focus on the most ambiguous anticipated moments. And this is where empiricism comes in: it can simulate multiple alternative decisions (or, more generally, competing hypotheses), weigh the outcomes of each, and choose a path accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has provided evidence for neural representations (observed as correlations of activity as measured by an fMRI machine) of everything from low level visual properties like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050589&quot;&gt;color&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallantlab.org/index.php/publications/natural-speech-reveals-the-semantic-maps-that-tile-human-cerebral-cortex/&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3251&quot;&gt;specific people&lt;/a&gt;. Simulation theory posits that not only do these neurons activate in &lt;em&gt;response&lt;/em&gt; to a conscious experience of these concepts, but that a key role of each representation is generation. In this way, coalitions of activating contexts produce perceptual simulations that unfold in time in a way that is consistent with the learned probabilistic dynamics (the most likely sequences) in the world. This shouldn’t be too surprising since we can verify our brain’s incredible knack for this easily: imagine hitting a nail into a two-by-four. What happened? Not only did you just confirm that it’s possible to get a cylinder of iron into a block of wood, but you probably visualized that to do so you’d typically use a hammer, and you probably experienced an echo of the sensations you’d feel when performing this action: the handle pushing back against your hand, the sound of metal against metal, and possibly even a hint of fear as you consider a painful miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Simulation in Perception, Prediction, and Planning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KfgC2KOghxVIqOHbHi9NFw.png&quot; /&gt;Ocular simulation as perceptual ‘filling in’ — abstract representations of potential gaze targets produce the experience of a complete and rich visual field&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating potential extensions of simulation theory is in the realm of perception. Could it be that the magical ‘filling in’ of our perceptual world (remember that the fovea of your eye produces a shockingly small radius of detail, despite what appears to be a rich visual scene), can be explained by simulation as well? Consider that just as we have motor affordances such as extending a finger to push a button, actions as subtle and typically subconscious as eye movements (saccades) are also generated by our motor system. Contexts that present themselves to us visually may, then, present ocular affordances: the percept of the trunk of a tree affords the ocular motor commands necessary to produce a visual transition to its branches above. If simulations are indeed happening constantly, and exploring (and generating) multiple futures conditioned on a variety of afforded actions, by extension we must at all times be simulating the effects of plausible saccades — imagining the visuals we’d experience if we were to look up, left, wherever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the case of simulating visual actions in a little more detail. Imagine viewing a printed letter through a microscope, and seeing the cropped image in the left box below. You’d likely have guessed you were looking at an ‘i’, a ‘j’, or noted the ambiguity — it’s one or the other but impossible to tell which.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/711/1*IMdkzApakVxn0e6wCjtOfg.png&quot; /&gt;Visual perception as ocular simulation. Saccade.Down produces conflicting futures (‘bottom of i’ and ‘bottom of j’) that demand resolution via action. Saccade.Up is simulated with consensus from both hypotheses, and does not require validation via action.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolving what we might call causal ambiguity is a crucial and rarely conscious part of perception. When viewing the ambiguous image of the cropped letter, we might recruit two possible actions: we can move our eyes slightly up or slightly down to reveal the content above or below the current field of view. Simulations of these two afforded actions partially activate the same networks we’d use in the overt action (the actual saccade), but without executing them. Because we’ve seen the letters i and j many times before we have a memory of the features that compose each. &lt;em&gt;Saccade.Up&lt;/em&gt; is guaranteed to produce the percept of a dot atop a letter, but the simulation of &lt;em&gt;Saccade.Down &lt;/em&gt;is ambiguous. To use a term coined by the father of active inference, Karl Friston, this action has a high &lt;em&gt;epistemic value&lt;/em&gt;: it is very likely to resolve a conflict in our simulation, the ambiguity of ‘I’m looking at i’ vs ‘I’m looking at j’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it is well beyond the scope of this post, some recent formulations of enactive cognition propose that the brain’s decision-making can be modeled by a simultaneous drive for epistemic value (resolving ambiguity in the world) and direct (intrinsic) reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous fascinating implications of enactivism and the concept of cognitive embodied simulation, especially when we apply these ideas to higher level planning on longer time scales, as well as simulations of the actions of others. For me this theory also frames an important reality: the stuff of simulation, its primary driver, might be summed up as cognitive bias. Give a brain a seed of a few abstract concepts (hammer&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;nail, two-by-four… go), and it will not only generate, but experience futures that have not yet (and maybe never will) become reality. Imagining the future by running a simplified model in this way is a computationally powerful tool, but getting it was an expensive bargain, the cost of which is a propensity for an array of misconceptions, overconfident projections, and every kind of prejudice. At times, our simulations are paper thin, and this highlights a jarring weakness in what may be a key mechanism behind each decision we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to read more or see some data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onejgordon/embodied-cognition-simulation/blob/master/papers.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a partial list of papers sharing empirical results related to enactivism or simulation theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=613aefe38391&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/empirical-enactivism-613aefe38391&quot;&gt;Empirical Enactivism: How our brains simulate the world in order to experiment on the future&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Brain Blogger: Facebook Science: How Facebook Breaks Effect Stress and Wellbeing</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inadvertently, in the wake of recent Facebook data harvesting scandals, Elon Musk and Brian Acton spurring on Facebook users to #DeleteFacebook in past weeks and the resulting Facebook breaks could (potentially) do some good for the average users stress levels. While differences between being deleted, deactivated, or abandoned have yet to be explored, new research is the first to report that the average user can relieve physiological measures of stress by taking a break from Facebook—at least in the short-term.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings from a 2013 survey in the Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp;amp; American Life Project, posit that 61% of current &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/24/facebook-are-we-over-connected/&quot;&gt;Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; reported taking a “Facebook vacation,” in which they voluntarily stopped using Facebook for several weeks or more. Moreover, 20% of adults reported having once used Facebook but that they no longer did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study that was just published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers in Australia investigated how taking a Facebook break (i.e., abstaining from using Facebook) effects stress and wellbeing. They recruited 138 active Facebook users and split them into two groups: the Facebook use as normal and five-day Facebook break groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/16/cerebral-congestion-why-giving-your-brain-a-break-improves-productivity/&quot;&gt;Taking a break &lt;/a&gt;from Facebook lowered levels of salivary cortisol (a stress biomarker) after just five days. Yet despite this physiologically stress-relieving effect, users taking a Facebook break reported feeling lower levels of life satisfaction and wellbeing than users that continued Facebook use as normal (as measured by subjective reports from the users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seemingly contradictory effects are consistent with the general love-hate feelings about Facebook that may typify most active users, exemplified by “I’m done with Facebook” posts one minute and regular selfies and check-ins the next—its a super social tool with tonnes of obvious benefits, but often feels taxing, addictively time-wasting, forces social comparison, lowers self-esteem, and can be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/22/do-you-suffer-from-techno-stress/&quot;&gt;information overload&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its important to remember that Facebook users in this study were not users that had reached Facebook breaking point and desired a Facebook vacation themselves. They were essentially “cut off” from Facebook for the purpose of the experiment, with the researchers reasoning that subjective feelings of life-satisfaction and well-being were lowered by removing a currently desired means of contact and connection with others, despite the break lowering stress levels by other means.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, two other Facebook break studies may seem to contradict the reduced wellbeing observed from taking a Facebook break. They reported that subjects reported feeling increased wellbeing when taking a Facebook break over a one-week (study 1) or two-week (study 2) period, particularly for the heaviest Facebook users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-day break in the newly published cortisol study was perhaps too short to observe the decline in subjective wellbeing previously reported from longer periods of regular Facebook use. Moreover, the Facebook break was also over a weekend, which is typically a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/12/how-to-boost-vacation-health-benefits-and-avoid-exhaustion/&quot;&gt;wellbeing booster&lt;/a&gt; and may have counteracted negative effects of regular Facebook use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the participants were recruited based on a willingness to give up Facebook for five days (and not naturally occurring Facebook vacations), and may have over-selected for people already overburdened by Facebook and seeking a good reason to have a Facebook break. However, this didn’t seem to be the case as only a handful of users reported that they expected the Facebook break to be a pleasant experience—the majority of the participants did not think a Facebook break would be a nice experience. As one participant speculated: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will probably feel…upset as my social life will be totally stopped if I cannot use Facebook and&lt;br /&gt;
cannot find my friends in Facebook, I will also feel like left behind as I will not be able to know&lt;br /&gt;
what has happened with my Facebook friends in the coming five days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many participants (unprompted) expressed happiness that they could get back onto Facebook again because they felt so cut off. Naturally occurring Facebook breaks, on the other hand, may come with better improvements in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/08/stress-shortens-life/&quot;&gt;stress levels &lt;/a&gt;that coincide with improved wellbeing because the break is truly desired and needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also be why the self-reports of stress were not significantly affected (statistically speaking), despite a trend towards reporting lower stress, where their negative perceptions about being cut off from Facebook (e.g., “I’m disconnected!”) influenced their perceived stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a moderator effect was found when participants were divided on the basis of Dunbar’s number, 150—the number of individuals with whom Dunbar suggested that any one person can maintain stable relationships with. Those with 150 or fewer friends showed a decline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/&quot;&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, whether they took a break or continued to use Facebook as usual. However, the small number of participants who actually had fewer than 150 friends prevented them from having sufficient power to fully test these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really get to the bottom of all this, researchers should be asking what happens to cortisol levels (and subjective stress and wellbeing) when people are disconnected from Facebook for much longer periods (e.g., months), the mechanisms involved, and to what extent naturally occurring cyclical patterns of Facebook activity occur (where stress from Facebook builds, users disconnect and go cold turkey, and then return as their desire to feel connected again builds).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounting evidence supports that taking short breaks from Facebook could be beneficial to both mental and physical health due to the significant role of stress and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/&quot;&gt;HPA axis&lt;/a&gt; in mental and physical disorders. This is particularly beneficial for people who heavily use the platform or experience too much social comparison and envy that harms their wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, research will likely tell us how long the breaks should be and how often and under what circumstances they should occur to get the most out of being both connected and disconnected from Facebook and perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/27/social-media-anxiety-disorders-whats-going-on-in-the-brain/&quot;&gt;social media use&lt;/a&gt; in general. Science can’t yet say with confidence the ways that deleting facebook and the #DeleteFacebook movement could impact users health and wellbeing, but it certainly suggests taking a #FacebookBreak if your #donewithfb. Maybe consider taking a Facebook break for lent next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most everyone knows that precision medicine promises to transform the healthcare landscape, delivering powerful and personalized treatments for previously intractable diseases. Even so, biotech innovators still face tremendous hurdles in realizing this promise — chief among them, finding access to sufficient numbers of annotated, characterized and consented patient samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/novaseek-research&quot;&gt;Novaseek Research&lt;/a&gt; has developed a unique solution to this dilemma: the Clinical Data Network for Research platform — otherwise known as CDNR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CDNR-Blog-Header.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CDNR Novaseek Research Science Exchange&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-1306 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CDNR-Blog-Header-300x123.png&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CDNR provides instant access to thousands of ethically-sourced patients’ specimens and associated real-world clinical data in pursuit of advancing the field of personalized medicine. Novaseek obtains biosamples and associated data through its extensive network of physicians, clinical labs, and hospitals. Within this network, Novaseek actively recruits patients to match targeted research needs. Novaseek also maintains a large searchable database of de-identified clinical information representing millions of patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through the Novaseek platform, researchers can easily obtain the data they need throughout the product life cycle. For instance, researchers seeking the statistics necessary for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; submissions can gain access to sufficient numbers of annotated, characterized and consented patient samples and related data. With CDNR, obtaining clinical data and biospecimens is seamlessly integrated into R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Advances in Parkinson’s Disease Treatment</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/04/09/advances-parkinsons-disease-treatment/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Deep Brain Stimulation&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Deep_Brain_Stimulation-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been 200 years since Dr. James Parkinson published the &lt;em&gt;An Essay On the Shaking Palsy&lt;/em&gt; describing the signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite the fact that there are lots of treatment options out there to ameliorate the patient’s symptoms and to improve their quality of life, we still don’t have any neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapy to slow down disease progression. But for patients with PD, the past few years have never been so hopeful in that new candidate therapies are being developed at a very fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting new drugs in the pipeline is probably &lt;strong&gt;exenatide&lt;/strong&gt;, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist which is currently used to treat type II diabetes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd171192&quot;&gt;Preclinical studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested its role in inhibiting cell death, reducing oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondria function, and promoting neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31585-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;placebo controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the efficacy of exenatide. In this study, 62 patients with moderate PD received weekly injections of exenatide or placebo in conjunction with their regular medication.  After 48 weeks those treated with exenatide showed improvements in motor functioning while those treated with placebo worsened. Of particular interest, 12 weeks after patients discontinued the medication the beneficial effects of exenatide remained. This study showed that a GLP-1 agonist may be able to improve symptoms and be neuroprotective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest, 12 weeks after patients discontinued the medication the beneficial effects of exenatide remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levodopa is a treatment for PD which increases levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain.  Unfortunately, after prolonged levodopa treatment patients with PD can develop abnormal and involuntary movements referred to as dyskinesia. This suite of symptoms is referred to as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and it is an unmet need for people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug amantadine, specifically the immediate release form of the drug, has been used to treat LID. This form of amantadine has not been well studied and central nervous system side effects are frequent at higher doses. Recently, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710325/&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; tested an extended-release form of amantadine. In this study, 126 patients with PD and sufferers from dyskinesia were randomized to receive &lt;strong&gt;amantadine extended-release capsules&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5763269/&quot;&gt;Patients’ dyskinesia improve at 12 weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but more excitingly the patients’ symptoms during the time off the treatment was also less compared to the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge that faces patients with Parkinson’s disease is motor fluctuations.  Motor fluctuations involve “on” periods where a patient responds positively while on a treatment and “off” periods where symptoms reemerge while the patient is still on the treatment. Currently there are better choices for adjunct therapy for patients with motor fluctuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pivotal phase 3 trial tested &lt;strong&gt;opicapone&lt;/strong&gt;. Opicapone could be of particular benefit for motor fluctuations since it works by preventing the breakdown of levodopa, thereby extending levels of levodopa in plasma. What’s special for this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2594533&quot;&gt;particular drug&lt;/a&gt; is that it has a long duration of action and can be given as a once daily regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Istradefylline &lt;/strong&gt;is another promising drug for PD with motor fluctuations.  Istradefylline blocks adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18339-1&quot;&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, istradefylline was found to be a well-tolerated drug. It decreased “off” periods and improved motor symptoms. However, since istradefylline has the potential to worsen dyskinesia it is recommended for patients in early PD who have not yet developed motor complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Brain Stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another treatment for Parkinson’s disease is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a rather intensive treatment in which electrodes are implanted into a certain areas of the brain. DBS often targets brain areas critical for movement such as the subthalamus. The electrodes placed in the brain can then send electrical impulses to ameliorate motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of DBS on motor function have been well documented, but there is less attention on non-motor symptoms. Overall, DBS has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28725706&quot;&gt;shown promising effects on non-motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, there is also evidence that DBS can improve sleep quality, musculoskeletal pain, urinary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (gastric emptying and constipation), weight loss and odor discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation on motor function have been well documented, but there is less attention on non-motor symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new brain area is being targeted with DBS, specifically for Parkinson disease dementia. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2665407?redirect=true&quot;&gt;recently published study&lt;/a&gt; used DBS surgery on the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The nucleus basalis of Meynert is the most important source for releasing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, to other brain areas critical for cognitive functioning, such as the neocortex. The rationale of this study is based on the fact that in the parkinsonian brain there is a significant deficit in brain activity related to acetylcholine. In animal models, low-frequency stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304394089903716&quot;&gt;shown to enhance cholinergic innervation of the cortex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study using nucleus basalis of Meynert DBS surgery didn’t show improvement in the primary cognitive outcomes, the procedure was well tolerated, opening up the possibility of DBS surgery for patients with PDD. Of interest, the authors observed a significant reduction in visual hallucination in 2 patients and decreased in the severity and frequency of dyskinesia in 3 patients, which require further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Ultrasound Subthalamotomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the development of DBS, ablative neurosurgery was widely used to treat movement disorders. Ablative neurosurgery involves the removal of a specific brain area. DBS is preferred over ablative neurosurgery due to its reversibility and documented efficacy for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is our responsibility, as physicians, to obtain newest medical information and to select therapies that are most suitable for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new technique has been developed for ablating specific brain areas. Gamma-knife and MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), allows for deep brain ablating without opening the skull. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration have now approved MRgFUS for patients with essential tremor. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30403-9/fulltext&quot;&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt; using focused ultrasound subthalatomy in patients with PD showed that it was effective, well tolerated and the adverse events seemed to be mostly mild and transient. This new technique will possibly become another treatment option in the future for patients who don’t want their brain to be opened. However, more studies with long term follow up are mandatory for confirming MRgURS’s efficacy and adverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PD is a heterogeneous disorder and every patient is unique. As more and more new drugs, devices and techniques are being developed, individualized treatment tailoring each patient’s symptoms and needs has never been so important. It is our responsibility, as physicians, to obtain the latest medical information and to select therapies that are most suitable for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my kids were toddlers, there were caches of easily-accessible toys in most rooms of our house. But perhaps I should have kept most of them stored away, and brought just a few out at a time, on rotation – because the results of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638317301613&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Infant Behaviour and Development&lt;/i&gt; suggest that a toddler with few toy options not only spends longer playing with each one – presumably developing their attentional skills – but is also more creative in their play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33662&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carly Dauch at the University of Toledo, US, and her colleagues studied 36 toddlers, aged between 18 and 30 months. The researchers drew from a pool of 32 toys of four types: educational toys (that teach colours, for example), “pretend” toys (that suggested themed scenarios – perhaps playing a being a doctor, for instance), action toys (that required an action such as stacking or building from the toddler, for example) and vehicles. The researchers videoed the toddlers taking part in two, 15-minute supervised play sessions: in one, they were in a room with one toy from each category (so four toys in total) and in the other, there were four from each category (so 16 in total).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when they presented the toddlers with 16 toys, the toddlers played on average with half of them during the assessment. In contrast, when they presented them with just four toys, the kids played on average with three.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the amount of toys available seemed to affect the way the toddlers played. When only four toys were on offer, each of the, on average, 10 play “incidents” lasted longer – around two minutes – compared with about a minute each for the, on average, 20 play incidents in the 16-toy condition. With fewer toys, the children also came up with about 60 per cent more different ways of interacting with each toy (such as “pretending”, “inserting”, “stacking”, etc).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen toys are more distracting than four, the authors conclude. Fewer available toys allow a child to focus more on a toy, to explore it more thoroughly, and to discover different ways of using it. Given evidence that young children can benefit from attention training, “an environment that presents fewer distractions may provide toddlers [with] the opportunity to exercise their intrinsic attention capabilities,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, many kids in the US and the UK, for example, are not exactly short on toys. In the UK, the toy market is worth around £3.5 billion annually, while in the US, around US$3.1 billion is spent on toys specifically for infants and pre-schoolers every year. One study of American middle class family homes reported that, on average, 139 toys were visible, with most homes having at least 100 and some as many as 250. Given these numbers, “potential disruption in play created by an abundance of toys may be even more apparent within a naturalistic environment,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the toys used in this study did not belong to the children involved. As anyone who’s ever taken a young child to the house of another – and witnessed the subsequent play frenzy – knows, unfamiliar toys are far more exciting, and distracting than familiar ones. It isn’t very surprising that the toddlers in the 16-toy condition checked out as many as they could, as quickly as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one way to stop young kids getting quickly bored of their toys is to restrict access to them. If hiding away most toys and making only a few available at any one time helps toddlers to develop their attentional skills – and be more creative in their play – &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; increases the odds that you’ll be able to walk through the living room without tripping over – surely it’s the way to go.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the coming months, some staff were struck down by hearing loss and concussion-like symptoms. The strange sounds were interpreted as the cause, perhaps even reflecting a sonic weapon of an unknown nature.



The story of the 'Havana embassy attack' has been told in detail but, until recently, there were no scientific studies of the event or its aftermath.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Finding the Right Way to Use Ketamine for Depression</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/06/finding-the-right-way-to-use-ketamine-for-depression/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have shown ketamine to be a promising treatment for those suffering from severe &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, but figuring out how to safely administer the drug has been a challenge for researchers. One hopeful delivery method was a nasal spray device because of its ease-of-use and the fact that it is less invasive than other methods such as injection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new Australian study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt; reveals some unexpected problems with the nasal spray method. In particular, the study shows the unpredictable nature of intranasal ketamine tolerance from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Professor Colleen Loo at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), who is based at Black Dog Institute, states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the intranasal method of ketamine delivery is not as simple as it first seemed. Many factors are at play when it comes to nasal spray ketamine treatments. Absorption will vary between people and can fluctuate on any given day within an individual based on such things as mucous levels in the nose and the specific application technique used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot trial aimed to analyze the effectiveness of repeated doses of ketamine through an intranasal device amongst 10 volunteers with severe depression, ahead of a larger randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the participants were given extensive training in proper self-administration techniques before receiving either a course of eight &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/&quot;&gt;ketamine treatments&lt;/a&gt; or an active control over a period of four weeks, under supervision at the study center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the observation of each patients’ initial reaction to the nasal spray, the dosages were adjusted to include longer time intervals between sprays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trial had to be put on hold after testing with five participants resulted in unexpected problems with tolerability. Side effects included &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/01/20/blood-pressure-and-accelerated-brain-aging/&quot;&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, psychotic-like effects, and motor incoordination which left some participants unable to continue to self-administer the spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Colleen Loo commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intranasal ketamine delivery is very potent as it bypasses metabolic pathways, and ketamine is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. But as our findings show, this can lead to problems with high peak levels of ketamine in some people causing problematic side effects. Other recent studies have questioned whether changes to ketamine’s composition after being metabolised into derivative compounds may actually deliver useful therapeutic effects. It remains unclear whether ketamine nasal sprays can be safely relied upon as a treatment for patients with severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research led by Loo last year revealed the success of ketamine’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;antidepressant &lt;/a&gt;effects in elderly patients when delivered in repeated doses, which were adjusted on an individual basis and given by the subcutaneous method (injections under the skin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our prior research has shown that altering the dose on an individual patient basis was important. However, we wanted to see if a simpler approach using a set dose of ketamine for all people and administered by nasal spray could work just as well in this latest pilot. More research is needed to identify the optimal level of ketamine dosage for each specific application method before nasal sprays can be considered a feasible treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now recruiting participants for the world’s largest independent trial of ketamine to treat depression, to determine the safety and effects of repeated dosing using subcutaneous injections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, their religion is a core part of their identity, the meaning they find in life, and their social world. It seems likely that changing this crucial aspect of themselves will have significant psychological consequences. A devout person would probably predict these will be unwelcome – increased emotional distress, isolation and waywardness. A firm atheist, on the other hand, might see the potential positives – perhaps the “deconvert” will grow in open-mindedness and thrive thanks to their newfound free thinking and spiritual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-10226-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Religion and Spirituality &lt;/i&gt;is among the first to investigate this question systematically and over time. The findings, which are focused on Protestant Christians, paint a complex picture. At least for this group, there is no single pattern of changes associated with losing or changing one’s religious faith, and the predictions of both the devout person and the atheist are, to some extent, accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33642&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Hui at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues asked their Christian Protestant participants, all Chinese, to complete the same set of psychological questionnaires on six separate occasions over a three-year period. These questionnaires measured their personality, values, beliefs and psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 600 participants provided complete data and, of these, 188 stopped describing themselves as Christian at some point through the study. Just over 82 per cent switched to describing themselves as non-believers, a few re-identified as Catholic, Buddhist or Taoist, and the remainder changed their self-label to “other”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hui’s team were most interested in any psychological changes that were different in kind or magnitude between those who lost or changed their religious identity and those that kept it (they ensured both groups were matched for gender and age and student status – a majority of both groups were students).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, there were no clear differences in personality change between the continuously religious and those that lost or altered their religious identity (for some reason the sample as a whole showed some decline in extraversion and agreeableness over time, but this was no different for the two groups). In terms of values and beliefs, the religious exiters increased more in “fate control” (believing that fate governs what happens in life, but that it is also possible to intervene in this process); and not surprisingly, they also showed a sharper decline in religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking difference between the groups was that those who lost their Christian Protestant identity showed much greater variation in their mental well-being over time. About half of the “de-converts” showed a reduction in depression and anxiety compared with the consistently religious group, and about half showed a greater increase in depression and anxiety, although within these broad strokes were further variations in their precise emotional “trajectory”. The de-converts as a whole also showed a greater improvement in their sleep than the consistently faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key factor seemed to be the de-converts’ personality and psychological state prior to losing their religion. If they were more extraverted and had adequate psychological resources, losing their faith seemed to be an opportunity for growth and even greater psychological resilience. In contrast, those who were neurotic and more mentally and physically vulnerable prior to losing their faith were more likely to experience greater psychological distress after becoming a non-believer (or in a small minority of cases, a believer in a different faith).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any theory asserting that all faith exiters change in the same way should be viewed with suspicion,” the researchers said. “Religious disengagement does not reduce anxiety for all faith exiters; however a reduction does occur for some people.” This contrasts with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rel0000082&quot;&gt;research on converts &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested a more straightforward picture in which most people showed improvements in psychological symptoms. “The process of faith exit should not be regarded as psychologically similar to or merely a reversal of religious conversion,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also allowed the researchers to look for psychological differences at the start of the study among those who subsequently lost their faith as compared with those who stayed in the same religion. Those participants who exited their religion were more likely to start out scoring lower on emotional stability, to be less trusting of others, and they tended to place less value on conformity, tradition and benevolence, and more value on self-direction, hedonism and the pursuit of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be up to future research to see if these findings replicate with people exiting other religions in other cultures. The researchers added that “future research with a longer time frame should address questions such as how long the change in psychological symptoms would last and whether they are only transitory for some people.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: What to do about tinnitus?</title>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/537210314/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus (i.e., ear or head noises not caused by external sounds) is common among the general population across the world. Tinnitus can be experienced as a “ringing in the ears.” It can also sound like a hissing, sizzling, or roaring noise. It can be rhythmic or pulsating. Tinnitus can be a non-stop, constant sound or an intermittent sound that disappears and returns without a pattern. It can occur in one or both ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus may be caused by trauma to the head (e.g., blast exposure, such as bombs or other explosive devices, or injuries to the head. such as traumatic brain injuries). It also can be caused by acoustical trauma (e.g., loud noises from earsplitting concerts, listening to music too loud). While tinnitus is different than hearing loss, individuals may have to deal with both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is a symptom of neural damage and thus reflects that an injury occurred. As a “phantom sensation” or subjective symptom, it indicates neural damage. Currently, there is no cure for subjective tinnitus. Objective tinnitus differs than the more commonly experienced subjective tinnitus; objective tinnitus can be attributed to an internal sound source, such as a pulsating blood vessel that is adjacent to the auditory nerve. Thus, surgery may improve objective tinnitus, but not subjective tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Scientists may find a cure for subjective tinnitus someday.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists may find a cure for subjective tinnitus someday. Until a cure is found, extreme caution should be taken about internet promises about pills or techniques to cure tinnitus. We know from decades of research and clinical trials that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some things that can help reduce suffering while having tinnitus. The following three steps can help you self-manage your tinnitus until a cure is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step that a person should take when experiencing tinnitus is to get a screening of the outer and inner ear and of one’s medical history by a physician or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to make sure there are no underlying medical issues that need to be treated (e.g., auditory lesions or vascular tumors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second step to take if you have tinnitus is undergo an audiological assessment. If you have a hearing impairment and tinnitus, using hearing aids can help in several ways. Hearings aids can amplify sounds from the environment, which help people pay less attention to the ‘internal noise’ created by tinnitus. Modern hearing aids also offer features of providing ‘white noise’ or other sounds that helps people pay less attention to their tinnitus. In general, it is helpful for people to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; to their ‘sound environments’ because they will pay more attention to their tinnitus in quiet environments. This includes turning on a radio, listening to music or a podcast, turning on a fan, or using a sound generator when trying to fall asleep at night or when trying to concentrate, such as during work or school tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third step to take when having tinnitus is to learn stress-management techniques. Tinnitus can be incredibly annoying, frustrating, and for some people, scary when it first occurs. Psychologically-based approaches, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and other approaches such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), help individuals manage the stress created by experiencing tinnitus. These can be learned from a counselor or psychologist, a tinnitus specialist, or from a variety of books and internet resources. For some people, stress may be a trigger for a reoccurrence of tinnitus. For others, high levels of stress can reduce their patience and increase their frustration with conditions like tinnitus. Programs like Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) teach people how to identify changeable and unchangeable stressors and how to match coping strategies with the type of stressor. For unchangeable conditions like tinnitus, people are taught that while they cannot ‘solve’ or get rid of the problem of tinnitus (given the current state of tinnitus research), they have control over their reactions to tinnitus. When people are less angry and reactive to tinnitus, they have more mental and cognitive space for the things that give them pleasure and satisfaction in life, like focusing on the goals that they want to accomplish or interacting with and helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While subjective tinnitus can be annoying, distressing, and irritating, it is not life-threatening. Our brains will pay less attention to tinnitus when we embed ourselves in rich sound environments and get involved in tasks and events that capture our interest. Further, individuals can learn how to use numerous self-management techniques to increase their quality of life with subjective tinnitus until a cure is found.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquisition, analysis and simulation of electrophysiological properties of the nervous system require multiple software packages. This makes it difficult to conserve experimental metadata and track the analysis performed. It also complicates certain experimental approaches such as online analysis. To address this, we developed NeuroMatic, an open-source software toolkit that performs data acquisition (episodic, continuous and triggered recordings), data analysis (spike rasters, spontaneous event detection, curve fitting, stationarity) and simulations (stochastic synaptic transmission, synaptic short-term plasticity, integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley-like single-compartment models). The merging of a wide range of tools into a single package facilitates a more integrated style of research, from the development of online analysis functions during data acquisition, to the simulation of synaptic conductance trains during dynamic-clamp experiments. Moreover, NeuroMatic has the advantage of working within Igor Pro, a platform-independent environment that includes an extensive library of built-in functions, a history window for reviewing the user’s workflow and the ability to produce publication-quality graphics. Since its original release, NeuroMatic has been used in a wide range of scientific studies and its user base has grown considerably. NeuroMatic version 3.0 can be found at http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com and https://github.com/SilverLabUCL/NeuroMatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US psychologist Walter Mischel famously tested children’s ability – aged four to six – to delay immediate gratification with his “Marshmallow Experiment”. It’s become a classic, not least because the children who were better at resisting one marshmallow now, for the promise of two if they waited, went on to enjoy more success in adult life. Mischel also showed that children with stronger willpower used better distraction strategies, such as looking away or covering their eyes. Now a group of Polish psychologists have extended this line of inquiry to toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638316300972&quot;&gt;The findings&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Infant Behaviour and Development&lt;/em&gt;, show that individual differences in self-control are already apparent at the tender age of 18 months. The study also reveals how self-control develops through the second year of life, and it shows the kind of toddler behaviours that were correlated with stronger willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33590&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta Bialecka-Pikul and her colleagues at Jagiellonian University recruited hundreds of toddlers and their parents. At 18 months, each toddler sat on his or her parent’s lap at a desk upon which was a corn puff treat – a hit with toddlers in Poland – under a transparent cup. The female experimenter got up and asked the toddler to wait for the treat until she returned to the room, which she did after 60 seconds. The parent was not allowed to intervene. The researchers videoed what happened while they were gone. At 24 months, the procedure was repeated, but the toddlers had to wait 90 seconds, and now the treat was tailored to their latest tastes, such as a jelly baby or chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred and thirty toddlers took part at both time points. At 18 months, 23 per cent of them successfully waited 60 seconds. At 24 months, 55 per cent of them successfully waited 90 seconds (it seems some toddlers are capable of greater willpower than adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was clear evidence of a developmental trajectory: most of the successful delayers at 24 months had failed to wait at the first test, suggesting they had acquired greater self-control over time. Going backwards was rare: only eight per cent of those who successfully resisted at 18 months failed to do so at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding the videos of the toddlers’ behaviour while they waited revealed 20 different types of behaviour, including: looking at, touching, playing with, and talking about the treat, as well as looking around, fidgeting, being noisy and touching themselves or their parent. Bialecka-Pikul and her team said these behaviours could be grouped into four main categories: attentional and movement based; communication; focusing on or acting on the treat in some way; and non-specific, such as fidgeting and making noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “attention and movement” category of behaviours was most strongly correlated with successfully waiting for the treat, at both 18 months and 24 months. “Glancing, looking around, or at other objects, or touching their own bodies turned out to be the set of behaviours that most helped children to succeed while waiting,” the researchers said, adding that it “explained 61 to 70 per cent of the variance in the time of delay [i.e. how long the toddlers were able to wait]”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 24 months compared with 18 months, the children showed less focus on the treat, while they increased in the other kinds of behaviour. Also, the biggest difference between those toddlers who gained the ability to delay gratification between 18 months and 24 months and those who didn’t was that the newly successful delayers started showing more attention and movement related behaviours than they had earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can be supposed that the increase in the ability to delay gratification was due to overcoming temptation by using an active strategy mainly based on the first signs of effortful attention,” the researchers said. “This result confirms the importance of such a set of behaviours for effectively delaying gratification”. Perhaps worth reminding yourself of these strategies the next time you reach for the cookie jar.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Update</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/BfX6-6EMEQE/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7455-4909&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;0000-0002-7455-4909&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was appointed PLOS’ CEO last year, I committed myself to transparency with the communities we serve. That’s why, while this is a difficult blog to write, it’s important for me to share that I am making the hard decision to eliminate 18 positions at PLOS. Much of this is related to a strategic decision to shift from developing a proprietary platform for submissions to creating innovation partnerships with a wider community (Most readers are already aware of this from my previous blog.) It’s also driven by the need to be fiscally responsible and remain a sustainable nonprofit organization that continues to lead transformations in scientific communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to reiterate what we’ve communicated internally. Our people and their passion are the most important part of what makes PLOS so special. The people whose roles have been eliminated are all excellent at what they do, and their leaving is a result of operational decisions, not performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we’ll be a leaner organization. This doesn’t mean we won’t continue to fully support our researchers and scientists. We’ve been careful in where we’ve streamlined operations and those who engage with us should not see any disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pivotal moment in the life of PLOS and Open Access (OA) as it was envisioned by our founders 17 years ago. While OA has seen strong adoption, much has evolved in the landscape. Changing how and when we share, access and evaluate all research outputs is more critical to science than ever. It will take many of us working together, in various forms of partnership, to accelerate and advance a culture and ecosystem of open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, I’ve been part of multiple transformations in publishing. This is what’s most exciting and daunting about our industry. Disruption takes stamina and a willingness to embrace the unknown while acting responsibly in the moment. This is our goal and commitment as we explore ways to drive innovation in our industry forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll continue to hear from me throughout the year as I share our wins and our challenges toward that vision. It’s my hope that through transparency and open dialogue, we can maintain the trust our community has placed in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXIX) The free energy principle</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxix-the-free-energy-principle/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The free energy principle is the theory that the brain manipulates a probabilistic generative model of its sensory inputs, which it tries to optimize by either changing the model (learning) or changing the inputs (action) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20-%20a%20rough%20guide%20to%20the%20brain.pdf&quot;&gt;Friston 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20A%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf&quot;&gt;Friston 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The “free energy” is related to the error between predictions and actual inputs, or “surprise”, which the organism wants to minimize. It has a more precise mathematical formulation, but the conceptual issues I want to discuss here do not depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it can be seen as an extension of the Bayesian brain hypothesis that accounts for action in addition to perception. It shares the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxviiithe-bayesian-brain/&quot;&gt;conceptual problems of the Bayesian brain hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, namely that it focuses on statistical uncertainty, inferring variables of a model (called “causes”) when the challenge is to build and manipulate the structure of the model. It also shares issues with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-brief-critique-of-predictive-coding/&quot;&gt;predictive coding&lt;/a&gt; concept, namely that there is a conflation between a technical sense of “prediction” (expectation of the future signal) and a broader sense that is more ecologically relevant (if I do X, then Y will happen). In my view, these are the main issues with the free energy principle. Here I will focus on an additional issue that is specific of the free energy principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific interest of the free energy principle lies in its formulation of action. It resonates with a very important psychological theory called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cognitive dissonance theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That theory says that you try to avoid dissonance between facts and your system of beliefs, by either changing the beliefs in a small way or avoiding the facts. When there is a dissonant fact, you generally don’t throw your entire system of beliefs: rather, you alter the interpretation of the fact (think of political discourse or in fact, scientific discourse). Another strategy is to avoid the dissonant facts: for example, to read newspapers that tend to have the same opinions as yours. So there is some support in psychology for the idea that you act so as to minimize surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the free energy principle acknowledges the circularity of action and perception. However, it is quite difficult to make it account for a large part of behavior. A large part of behavior is directed towards goals; for example, to get food and sex. The theory anticipates this criticism and proposes that goals are ingrained in priors. For example, you expect to have food. So, for your state to match your expectations, you need to seek food. This is the theory’s solution to the so-called “dark room problem” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347222/&quot;&gt;Friston et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;): if you want to minimize surprise, why not shut off stimulation altogether and go to the closest dark room? Solution: you are not expecting a dark room, so you are not going there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a concrete example to show that this solution does not work. There are two kinds of stimuli: food, and no food. I have two possible actions: to seek food, or to sit and do nothing. If I do nothing, then with 100% probability, I will see no food. If I seek food, then with, say, 20% probability, I will see food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say this is the world in which I live. What does the free energy principle tell us? To minimize surprise, it seems clear that I should sit: I am certain to not see food. No surprise at all. The proposed solution is that you have a prior expectation to see food. So to minimize the surprise, you should put yourself into a situation where you might see food, ie to seek food. This seems to work. However, if there is any learning at all, then you will quickly observe that the probability of seeing food is actually 20%, and your expectations should be adjusted accordingly. Also, I will also observe that between two food expeditions, the probability to see food is 0%. Once this has been observed, surprise is minimal when I do not seek food. So, I die of hunger. It follows that the free energy principle does not survive Darwinian competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, either there is no learning at all and the free energy principle is just a way of calling predefined actions “priors”; or there is learning, but then it doesn’t account for goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea to act so as to minimize surprise resonates with some aspects of psychology, like cognitive dissonance theory, but that does not constitute a complete theory of mind, except possibly of the depressed mind. See for example the experience of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; (as in surfing): you seek a situation that is controllable but sufficiently challenging that it engages your entire attention; in other words, you voluntarily expose yourself to a (moderate amount of) surprise; in any case certainly not a minimum amount of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Crap. &lt;i&gt;Merde. Ibn sharmoota&lt;/i&gt;.* Swear words exist in most cultures (Japan is a notable exception), and many of us use them so casually and so frequently that by the time children start school, they have, according to one count, acquired a profanity bank of 30 to 40 words. (My own seven-year-old loves to whisper “fricking” in a friend’s ear, making them both giggle guiltily. My only defence is that he certainly didn’t get that one from me…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since even words like “fuck” are used conversationally, at least in the US and UK, surely they’ve lost the power to trigger a negative response in a listener – especially as far as younger adults are concerned? Not according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X18758143&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Language and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;. Melanie DeFrank and Patricia Kahlbaugh, at Southern Connecticut State University, found that teenagers who swear casually were judged by college students as being less intelligent and less trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33600&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrank and Kahlbaugh recruited 138 students, including 101 women. The participants first completed a questionnaire asking them to rate the offensiveness of 10 swear words. (The words in order of most to least offensive, according to the participants’ ratings, were: bitch, fuck, bastard, shit, ass, jerk, screw, butt, crap and dang.) The participants also estimated how often they used and heard these kinds of words. While 17 per cent said they used between zero and five daily, just over 20 per cent reported using more than 21 every day. Thirteen per cent said they heard between zero and five, but 20 per cent reported hearing more than 21 daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the participants read two purported conversations between two 15-year-olds. They were asked to imagine that they were overhearing these conversations, and in each case, they had to rate the first speaker on overall impression, intelligence, trustworthiness, sociability, politeness and likability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialogues were presented as being either between two males, two females, or a male and a female. Also, either one or both speakers used swear words from the list, or neither of them did. In all other respects, the conversations were exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an extract from a female-female conversation in which both parties swore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “Hey, what’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “Hey, how are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “Good. Just about to head to class. Can’t be late. You know how he is. He’ll bitch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “I hate that shit. You can’t even be a second late before they get on to you about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica: “I know, and they give us so much work. I already have so much shit to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley: “Me too. It’s not even funny. I have like three fucking tests coming up in the same week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrank and Kahlbaugh found that, overall, as well as being judged to be less intelligent and less trustworthy, both males and females who swore were considered to be less likeable, more offensive and more aggressive. Also, speakers (male or female) who swore during a mixed-gender conversation were rated as being less sociable. And males who used swear words in conversation with females were rated as being more offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was despite the fact that just under half of the participants said that they did not consider the swearing version of the dialogue to be “profane”. Even the swear words that the students perceived to be most offensive – bitch and fuck – they still only rated midway on the offensiveness scale, on average, and some students rated them as completely inoffensive. “Despite people not considering the… language offensive, they are still affected by it and use it to judge others, suggesting a subliminal effect,” DeFrank and Kahlbaugh write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perhaps worth stressing that findings from a group of college students in Connecticut who thought they were judging teenage strangers don’t necessarily apply generally. But since first impressions do matter – and can last – perhaps we should all be more careful about casual swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, “people have become more desensitized to certain swears and even expect them at times,” the researchers note. “Having said that, there is still a language bias. Word choices matter, even when we think they do not or when we think they should not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X18758143&quot;&gt;Language Choice Matters: When Profanity Affects How People Are Judged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hidden layer of regulation selects surviving cancer cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely established that cancers develop when cells mutate. However, resistance to therapy might go &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elx001&quot;&gt;beyond cancer mutations&lt;/a&gt;. Though chemotherapy might kill most of the cancer, tiny populations of drug-resistant cancer cells manage to survive and propagate. Unlike the more familiar case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, where genetic mutations give rise to resistance, many adaptations in treatment-resistant cancers are not the result of mutation. The DNA may stay the same, but cancer cells adapt to therapy and outsmart the drugs by switching their gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such adaptations do not affect the DNA itself, a hidden layer of regulation controlling the activity of genes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15681&quot;&gt;epigenetic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-017-0173-2&quot;&gt;metabolic signals&lt;/a&gt; — help cancer cells survive. By targeting this hidden program, it may be possible to overcome deadly cancer resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0554-1&quot;&gt;new research now published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Systems Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cancer systems biology team of Professor Fabian V. Filipp at the University of California Merced introduces a cellular model of cancer resistance. Under the selective pressure of mitogen activated kinase inhibitors cells are completely rewired yet manage to escape the anti-cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probing melanoma genomes reveals new targets and challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients respond very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how cancer becomes treatment resistant, it is useful to compare pathways in treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant cancers such as melanomas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857&quot;&gt;Melanoma&lt;/a&gt; is a cancer that originates in melanocytes, the cells that produce the skin-color pigment melanin and is usually caused by UV damage. Though not the most common form of skin cancer, it is the most aggressive. And if it’s not caught and treated early, it’s also among the deadliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UV damage gives rise to point mutations — changes in a single letter of the 3 billion letter human genome. These mutations can &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2016.01.003&quot;&gt;interfere with signals&lt;/a&gt; that tell cells when to grow and divide and when to stop. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857&quot;&gt;Mutations in a protein called BRAF&lt;/a&gt;, a major signaling regulator, cause growth signals to be stuck in the “on” position and drive cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although scientists have managed to come up with drugs that target and turn off aberrant BRAF signaling, cancer cells are clever and learn to adapt to these BRAF-inhibitors. Today, many patients respond to targeted treatment against BRAF signaling very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10074&quot; style=&quot;width: 1010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10074&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/researchers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Professor Fabian V. Filipp with his team working on precision targeting of malignant melanoma at UC Merced Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory. High-throughput screening in combination with systems biology analysis identifies master regulators and new drug targets of therapy resistance in malignant melanoma.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Photo by Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Fabian V. Filipp. Used with permission. CC BY-NC-SA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewiring of gene expression and metabolism to bypass drug blockage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma is able circumvent BRAF inhibitors not by changing the genes themselves, but by changing gene activity, making them more or less active. Some of the genes with reduced activity were in the same or related signaling pathway as BRAF, the mutated protein that gave rise to the cancer and the main target of chemotherapy. The resistant cells managed to evolve in a way to bypass the signaling blockade or come up with a new way to maintain proliferation. Genes with increased activity were in metabolic pathways that allowed cancer cells to bypass BRAF altogether and continue to grow and divide. Cancer cells had essentially figured out how to survive by rewiring their metabolism in response to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems biology predicts adaptive responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daunting as this may sound, it actually offers hope to scientists and clinicians who want to treat chemo-resistant cancers. Non-genomic drug adaptation can be accomplished reproducibly in cultured cells, and combination therapies that block adaptive mechanisms in vitro have shown promise in improving rates and durability of response. Thus, better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer models in combination with systems biology will pave the way for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systems biology approach reveals that signaling pathways undergo major rewiring at the transcriptional level while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of such transcriptional plasticity is dysregulation at the level of different upstream master regulators, while maintaining similar effector genes. Combination therapies including targeted approaches and immune checkpoint inhibition are promising and rapidly improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10081&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-10081&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/180404_Filipp_Systems_Biology_Cancer_Rsistance_Screen-1024x640.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Cellular models of therapy resistance allow for screens of combination therapies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Images by Systems Biology and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Fabian V. Filipp. Used with permission. CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these therapies to show durable, progression-free successes in the clinical setting, adaptation mechanisms of treatment resistances need to be understood. Cellular models in combination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.4103/1477-3163.115423&quot;&gt;systems biology analyses&lt;/a&gt; across epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes provide insight into how non-genomic drug adaptation is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing efforts are focused on utilizing the established &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/srep32611&quot;&gt;preclinical models&lt;/a&gt; to overcome drug adaptation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10555-017-9662-4&quot;&gt;precision medicine&lt;/a&gt; profiling of cancer patients. Over time, a better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Modernization of mortuary practice and grief</title>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/536790534/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern western mortuary practices are characterized by the professionalization of the management and presentation of the corpse. These practices serve as a stark contrast to those in traditional societies across the world and those throughout history. Changes to how we treat and dispose of the dead are such that industrialized societies have become outliers on the spectrum of the world’s cultures. Modernity has afforded us with a more efficient system for handling the dead, yet research suggests that these alterations may be negatively impacting long-term grief outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death. Today, bereaved individuals in developed nations rarely participate in the ritualized preparation of the corpse, and, indeed, have minimal exposure to cues of death of any sort. Death specialists, such as mortuary cosmetologists and morticians, now wash, dress, and embalm the dead, amongst &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342958/What-really-happens-die-Behind-scenes-funeral-homes-America-dead-prepared-final-resting-place.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other invasive procedures&lt;/a&gt;. They have replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ideas.ted.com/11-fascinating-funeral-traditions-from-around-the-globe/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many traditional rituals&lt;/a&gt; of handling of the dead person by family and other community members. As a result, most people do not have the opportunity to see or interact with their loved one in a natural state of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human relationships require huge investments and generate massive benefits, and we are not willing to let go of them unless we have unequivocal evidence that the person is dead. This is one reason why it is common for bereaved individuals who have not seen their loved-one’s corpses, such as death through tragedy, to demand to see the body or evidence that the person died and why &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.who.int/hac/techguidance/management_of_dead_bodies.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the World Health Organization recommend it&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, any suggestions that the person may still be alive weighs heavy on our minds. We typically use cues of agency and appearances to determine if a person is alive, or dead. If the person moves, or if they look like a living person, then we assume that he or she is alive. Oftentimes people comment that the dead person looks as though he or she were simply sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the evolutionary sciences suggests that this tendency to assume an agent is alive was once adaptive and is now instinctual. For instance, assuming that a predator was dead when it was in fact alive would have been detrimental to our survival, so as a general rule of thumb, people are more receptive to cues of life than cues of death. When this basic tendency is coupled with the motivation to want to continue the relationship with the dead person, it takes only minimal cues to convince us that the person is still around. Often there is a conflict between what the bereaved person consciously believes and how they reason momentarily, such as a widow thinking that the sound of footsteps on the stairs is her deceased husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people now opt for a closed casket for their loved-ones, and even if they do see the corpse, it most often follows complex professional preparation of the corpse aimed at minimizing cues of death. The “disneyfication of death” is common practice, where the deceased are artificially manipulated to resemble their appearance during life. Often photographs depicting the person when they were alive are placed on top of the casket or with a funerary order of service. With the rise of social media, such as in memorandum Facebook pages enable the community to endlessly revisit the person when he or she was alive with the click of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers have shown that ritualization helps us to feel more in control of life events and they also provide us with an opportunity to receive social support from the community, which also has positive mental health benefits. Yet much of the ritualization involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://gizmodo.com/the-morbid-art-of-making-dead-bodies-beautiful-1221696867&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preparing the corpse for disposal has been given to professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now generally accepted in the clinical literature that long-term outcomes are better for those who view the body of a loved one, as doing so is thought to help people come to terms with the death. Naturalistic data suggests that even in traumatic circumstances, viewing the body of a loved one may increase anxiety and distress in the short term, but is associated with less distress in the longer term. Conversely, not seeing the body is associated with more difficult, prolonged grief. Health care professionals often observe that spending time both viewing and touching the body of a deceased loved one is conducive to better outcomes. Grief is one of the most intensely stressful experiences faced by humans and modern practices may be retarding the process.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Conflict-resolution mantras for the workplace and everyday life [infographic]</title>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/536771704/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Great leaders show composure during stressful situations. But remaining cool and collected in times of crisis is easier said than done, partly due to our own behavioral patterns. Allowing ourselves to become tethered to a particular agenda or resolution puts us at risk for increased stress and diminished communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open to personal change is the first step to improving conflict-resolution habits. Self-management allows leaders to more effectively manage conflicts. Mantras (or internal chants) are a great way to self-manage: these small reminders can help us control our emotions and, in turn, any conflicts that arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With insights from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-you-dont-know-about-leadership-but-probably-should-9780190620820&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What You Don’t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/change-9780190866853&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change: What Really Leads to Lasting Personal Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we put together a list of mantras for effective conflict-resolution. Take a look at the infographic below to see how you might better handle difficult conversations—both in and out of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that we learn better when taught via our preferred modality or “learning style” – such as visually, orally, or by doing – is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;not supported by evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless the concept remains hugely popular, no doubt in part because learning via our preferred style can lead us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/05/it-feels-as-though-we-learn-better-via-our-preferred-learning-style-but-we-dont/&quot;&gt;feel like we’ve learned more, even though we haven’t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advocates of the learning styles approach argue that the reason for the lack of evidence to date is that students do so much of their learning outside of class. According to this view, psychologists have failed to find evidence for learning styles because they’ve focused too narrowly on whether it is beneficial to have congruence between teaching style and preferred learning style. Instead, they say psychologists should look for the beneficial effects of students studying outside of class in a manner that is consistent with their learning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Anatomical Sciences Education&lt;/em&gt;, a pair of researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine have conducted just such an investigation with hundreds of undergrads. Once again however the findings do not support the learning styles concept, reinforcing its reputation among mainstream psychologists as little more than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/&quot;&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33559&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of term, Polly Husmann and Valerie Dean O’Loughlin asked hundreds of undergrads on an anatomy course (which involved lectures and practical lab classes) to take one of the most popular online learning styles surveys, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/&quot;&gt;the VARK&lt;/a&gt;. Taken by millions of people worldwide, the VARK categorises students according to how much they prefer to learn visually, via auditory information, through reading and writing, or through kinaesthetics (by doing or by practical example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VARK website also offers study tips based on your supposed preferred learning style(s). The researchers encouraged their student participants to take the survey and to adopt the study practices consistent with their dominant learning style. Later in the term, the researchers surveyed them about the methods they’d actually used when studying outside of class, to see if they used methods in line with their supposed dominant learning style. Finally, the researchers accessed the students’ end-of-year grades to see if there was any association between grade performance, dominant learning style, and/or studying outside of class in a way consistent with one’s dominant learning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are bad news for advocates of the learning styles concept. Student grade performance was not correlated in any meaningful way with their dominant learning style or with any learning style(s) they scored highly on. Also, while most students (67 per cent) actually failed to study in a way consistent with their supposedly preferred learning style, those who did study in line with their dominant style did not achieve a better grade in their anatomy class than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, there were specific study strategies, such as practising microscope work and using lecture notes, that were associated with better grade performance, regardless of students’ learning style. Other activities, such as using flash cards, were associated with poorer performance, perhaps because they were a sign of learning by rote rather than deeper learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husmann and O’Loughlin don’t pull any punches in their conclusion. Their findings, they write – especially when considered in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; – “provide strong evidence that instructors and students should not be promoting the concept of learning styles for studying and/or for teaching interventions. Thus, the adage of ‘I can’t learn subject X because I am a visual learner’ should be put to rest once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
