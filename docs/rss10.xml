In a 2014 Cell paper, the team — led by Patrik Ernfors at the Karolinska Institutet — reported that they had identified a small molecule […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Privacy Shield Certification Shows Our Commitment to Protecting Customer Data</title>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/07/privacy-shield-certification-shows-our-commitment-to-protecting-customer-data/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science Exchange First &amp;amp; Only R&amp;amp;D Outsourcing Platform to Receive EU-U.S. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy Shield Framework Certification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO CA, July 20, 2017 – Science Exchange today announced that it is the first and only R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform to receive EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This certification demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of sensitive data shared by its customers and scientific service providers on the Science Exchange platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and Swiss Administration, the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework provides companies with a method to conform to data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic business. This new framework replaces the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The privacy and security of data for scientific research is a top priority for our customers and service providers, and we saw this certification as an important step for Science Exchange, especially in light of recent cyberattacks that affected companies across the healthcare and biopharma industries,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “The thousands of companies that use the Science Exchange platform can be assured that we are committed to the protection of the personal and scientific data entrusted to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification, companies must commit to a range of data management requirements, including that they will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform individuals about how their data is processed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain data integrity and purpose limitation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure accountability for data transferred to third parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and certify that all requirements are met on an annual basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being the only R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform with EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification, Science Exchange is also SOC 2 compliant, which validates that the company meets standardized criteria for managing data privacy and security – a certification that is increasingly required by regulators and auditors. Science Exchange is also ISO 9001 certified, which recognizes that the company adheres to strict quality management principles and maintains a consistent quality assurance program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, the film &lt;em&gt;Lucy&lt;/em&gt; came out starring Scarlett Johansson as the eponymous heroine who is implanted with drugs that allow her to use the full capacity of her brain rather than the mere 10 per cent that the rest of us supposedly use. In response I wrote an article for WIRED “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;All you need to know about the 10 per cent brain myth in 60 seconds&lt;/a&gt;“. Soon afterwards I received an angry, acerbic 1,200-word email from a reader: “I am obviously not going to insist you take your article down since that isn’t my place,” she wrote, “but you should certainly not feel proud to be spreading such misinformed information to the public”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What particularly shocked me was not just the tone of the correspondence, but the fact this email, endorsing the 10 per cent brain myth, came from a Masters student in neuroscience at Yale. But perhaps this wasn’t such an odd occurrence. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01314/abstract&quot;&gt;new US survey&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; finds that belief in brain myths remains widespread, and moreover, that extensive education in neuroscience seems to provide little protection from such beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27063&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Macdonald at the University of Houston and her colleagues, including Lauren McGrath at the University of Denver, recruited a total of 3,877 people to take a survey of brain myths hosted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://testmybrain.org&quot;&gt;Testmybrain.org&lt;/a&gt; website. This included 3,045 members of the general public, 598 teachers, and 234 people with “high neuroscience exposure” (defined as having completed many college/university courses related to the brain or neuroscience). The researchers had sent messages to neuroscience email lists and social networks to attract people with neuroscience training to take the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey featured 32 statements about the brain, 14 of which were true (e.g. we use our brains 24 hours a day) and 18 of which were false (e.g. we only use 10 per cent of our brain). Many of the items were the same or similar to those used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00429/full&quot;&gt;earlier surveys&lt;/a&gt; of belief in neuromyths among teachers in the UK and The Netherlands. The participants’ task was simply to indicate which statements were true and which were false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that teachers endorsed fewer brain myths than the general public, and those participants with neuroscience training endorsed fewer brain myths than teachers. And yet, all three groups still displayed high levels of brain myth endorsement, especially for what Macdonald and her colleagues identify as the classic brain myths, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;Learning styles myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 93 per cent of the public, 76 per cent of teachers, and 78 per cent of those with neuroscience education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/myths/myth_17.cfm&quot;&gt;A common sign of dyslexia is seeing letters backwards&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 76 per cent of the public, 59 per cent of teachers, and 50 per cent of those with neuroscience education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130107-can-mozart-boost-brainpower&quot;&gt;Listening to classical music increases children’s reasoning ability&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 59 per cent of the public, 55 per cent of teachers, and 43 per cent of the neuroscience group) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/19/music-teachers-and-students-fall-for-music-related-neuromyths-german-study/&quot;&gt;more on music-related neuromyths&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/the-sugar-high-is-actually-just-a-parenting-myth.html?mid=twitter_scienceofus&quot;&gt;Children are less attentive after consuming sugar&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 59 per cent of the public, 50 per cent of teachers and 39 per cent of the neuroscience group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;The left-brain right-brain myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 64 per cent of the public, 49 per cent of teachers and 32 per cent of the neuroscience group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;10 per cent myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 36 per cent of the public, 33 per cent of teachers, and 14 per cent of those with neuroscience education – my unfriendly correspondent is not alone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the participants with extensive exposure to neuroscience (most of whom said they had at a minimum a science or health-related university degree) endorsed just under half of the neuromyths (specifically 46 per cent, compared with 68 per cent average endorsement among the public and 56 per cent among teachers). Another clear pattern in the findings was that participants who believed one of the above myths were more likely than average to also endorse one or more of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are worrying because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/10-ways-brain-myths-harming-us/&quot;&gt;brain myths are harmful&lt;/a&gt;: they undermine valid neuroscience findings and they encourage bogus practices in health, education and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? Why is training in neuroscience not enough to prevent many people from endorsing some of the most hackneyed brain myths? Macdonald and her colleagues note that many of the most widely endorsed myths pertain to education and the supposed application of neuroscience to improving learning. They speculate that perhaps it’s possible to study the brain-basis of dyslexia or memory, for instance, while remaining unaware of related psychological research, such as on the behavioural manifestations of dyslexia or the findings that have challenged the concept of learning styles. In other words, perhaps the issue is partly one of different levels of explanation: just because you are schooled in neuroscience doesn’t mean you are aware of psychological findings that are pertinent to education-based neuromyths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[These findings] suggest that if educators were to take a class in neuroscience that did not specifically address neuromyths, it would unlikely to help with dispelling the misconceptions that are most closely related to learning and education,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that programmes intended to combat belief in neuromyths might benefit from highlighting how many myths mistakenly imply that a single factor is responsible for, or indicative of, a given outcome (e.g. sugar causing bad behavior or letter reversals being a sign of dyslexia) when in fact many factors are usually involved in learning and cognition. Also, myth-busting programmes could emphasise how many of us seem to have a bias to find explanations more credible when they contain neuroscience references, no matter how gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting a few problems with the new survey (acknowledged by the researchers themselves), such as the fact the general public who took part were highly educated compared with the wider US population as a whole – of course this may suggest the observed levels of myth endorsement are an underestimate. Also, the neuroscience group in the survey self-reported their own experience of neuroscience so it’s not clear exactly what kind of courses they’d completed. And some might say that there’s an inherent problem with asking people to give a simple “true/false” response to statements about the brain – it leaves little room for nuance and some statements may be open to multiple interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Accelerating ethics review during disease outbreaks: what we can learn from West Africa’s Ebola Outbreak</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Ebola-4-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zika virus, Ebola virus, and avian flu outbreaks are among the more recent and well-known international public health emergencies. It is critical to quickly control such outbreaks to minimize spreading, but often there is no standard treatment or vaccine. Therefore researchers investigating new drugs or treatments must work against the clock to discover effective treatments, without compromising ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we ease the process of ethics approval during public health emergencies? In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0201-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers Emilie Alirol &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; describe their experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; ethics review during the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, providing recommendations to accelerate study approval in future health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebola Virus Outbreak (2013-2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2013-2016 Ebola Outbreak was the largest outbreak of Ebola virus in history, and also the most deadly. With approximately 11,300 reported deaths, this outbreak killed more people than all previous outbreaks combined. At the start of the epidemic, Ebola virus research was limited to laboratory studies and data from previous outbreaks. There was no established vaccine available, and potential vaccines were still in early development. This proved especially concerning given the high mortality rate (40-90% dependent on country) and the large scale in which the disease was spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9254&quot; style=&quot;width: 303px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9254&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-293x300.png&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;2014 Map of Ebola outbreaks in West Africa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons, Source: CDC&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the urgency of the outbreak, the WHO decided that use of unregistered medical interventions was acceptable, provided ethical standards were not compromised. It also allowed for a streamlined review process, with the hopes of identifying potential treatments more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for future public health emergencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the outbreak, the WHO-ERC reviewed 24 new protocols and 22 amended protocols in total, including observational and interventional studies. In the article by Emilie Alirol &lt;em&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt; a number of approaches are proposed to help accelerate the study approval process, which are applicable to any future disease outbreaks, not just Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that incorrect or incomplete information was the most common hindrance of rapid ethics approval. For example, missing information on data sharing, inappropriate participant information documents, or inconsistent details like sample size. Despite time pressure, it’s recommended that documents are thoroughly reviewed to prevent unnecessary delays as these issues are avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9276&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9276&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-5-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;CDC staff member preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons; Via CDC Global&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer collaboration between local and international researchers may also prove effective. Studies during the Ebola outbreak were often led by international researchers, as resources were limited in locally affected areas. Local researchers have beneficial knowledge of the local culture which can be used to encourage study participation and provide advice on appropriate study plans, ultimately fast-tracking the study process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template agreements and joint committees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more specific systems proposed includes development of template agreements for data and sample ownership and use. Many of the studies didn’t provide enough of this information which delayed approval. Because negotiating these agreements can be time consuming, the authors recommend developing template agreements which can be drafted from international consultations and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also suggest forming a Joint Ethics Review Committee, as many trials require approval from multiple ethics committees. The joint committee would include members of committees from the countries or institutions relevant to the outbreak. Rather than waiting for approval from multiple committees, a joint committee would cut approval time while also providing the value of cross-trial data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9257&quot; style=&quot;width: 209px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9257&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-3-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Poster spread by the Sierra Leone Government during Ebola Outbreak&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons,  Sierra Leone Goverment with the help of Limkokwing University of Creative Technology&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation of pregnant women and children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most difficult proposal to implement would be the inclusion of pregnant women and children in clinical trials. In previous Ebola outbreaks, mortality rates of pregnant women were about 90%, and the highest mortality rates were in children 4 years old or younger. Given the high mortality in these groups, it makes them the most likely to benefit from a health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rates encouraged the WHO-ERC to request protocol amendments that include children and pregnant women in studies. Despite the potential benefits, pregnant women and children were not included in any of the studies, likely due to ethical and liability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are normally excluded from trials, children and pregnant women generally accept treatments based on data from other groups. In order to improve their clinical care during health emergencies, the authors of this article push for their inclusion during future outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for future outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of timeliness is one of the most challenging aspects of conducting clinical research during public health emergencies. The experience of Emilie Alirol&lt;em&gt; et al. &lt;/em&gt;during the Ebola Outbreak displays many of the issues researchers face during such emergencies. They provide us with useful suggestions to accelerate the ethics approval process, and these should be taken into consideration in preparation for future outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Rapid elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV by immunization in cows</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/VZd_ePKhiss/nature23301</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 No immunogen to date has reliably elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV in humans or animal models. Advances in the design of immunogens (BG505 SOSIP) that antigenically mimic the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)1 have improved the elicitation of potent isolate-specific antibody responses in rabbits2 and macaques3, but so far failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. One possible contributor to this failure is that the relevant antibody repertoires are poorly suited to target somewhat occluded conserved epitope regions on Env relative to exposed variable epitopes. To test this hypothesis, we immunized four cows with BG505 SOSIP. The antibody repertoire of cows contains long third heavy chain complementarity determining regions (HCDR3) with an ultralong subset that can reach over 70 amino acids in length4–9. Remarkably, BG505 SOSIP immunization resulted in rapid elicitation of broad and potent serum antibody responses in all four cows. Longitudinal serum analysis for one cow showed the development of neutralization breadth (20%, n = 117 cross-clade isolates) in 42 days and 96% breadth (n = 117) at 381 days. A monoclonal antibody isolated from this cow harboured an ultralong HCDR3 of 60 amino acids and neutralized 72% of cross-clade isolates (n = 117) with a potent median IC50 value of 0.028 μg ml−1. We note that breadth was elicited with a single trimer immunogen and did not require additional envelope diversity. Immunization of cows may provide an avenue to rapidly generate antibody prophylactics and therapeutics to address disease agents that have evolved to avoid human antibody responses.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: For one week these women recorded all the times they were objectified sexually</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ranking of genuinely important YouTube videos to have gone viral, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A&quot;&gt;this one (see above)&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 places high: it shows over 100 instances of harassment endured by a woman wearing a hidden camera as she walked around New York City for ten hours, including comments, stares, winks and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was posted in 2014 by the domestic violence activist group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ihollaback.org&quot;&gt;Hollaback!&lt;/a&gt; to highlight the prevalence of this kind of behaviour. As individual testimony, it was powerful. But, critics could argue, it was just one woman, on just one day. This is an argument they cannot use about the results of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12152/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, which the researchers, led by Elise Holland at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believe is the first to capture just how common sexual harassment and “objectification” is in the daily lives of young women – and to show the possible impact on how women think about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-one women living in Melbourne, with an average age of 22, first completed a number of surveys, including measures of their self-esteem and personality. They were also shown examples of what the researchers considered to be different forms of objectification, including gazes and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the women downloaded an app to their own smartphones and they had to respond to its survey prompts for a week: these came in the form of three questions, ten times a day, at random intervals between 10am and midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question was whether, since the last prompt, they’d been thinking about how they look to other people (rated on a scale from 0 to 100). Then, whether, since the last survey, they had been targeted by any sexually objectifying events; if they had, they could check boxes to indicate what type. And finally, whether they had witnessed anyone else being targeted by these kinds of behaviours; this included an extra option of “media image/video”, designed to capture sexual objectification in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women reported being the target of a “sexually objectifying event” on average roughly once every 2 days: 55 per cent of the events they recorded consisted of an “objectifying gaze”, while 11 per cent were cat calls or wolf whistles. Ten per cent were sexual remarks, and four per cent were “touching or fondling”. (As the researchers note, “While such severe instances of objectification may not be common everyday experiences they still occur frequently enough to have been captured in a 7-day…study with a sample of 81 women…”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also witnessed sexual objectification of another woman on average 1.35 times a day. The inclusion of a media image/video option perhaps unsurprisingly (given the way women are often portrayed in magazines and music videos) meant that the majority – roughly two thirds, in fact – of instances of witnessing objectification of other women fell into this category. But the volunteers also recorded many occasions of other women having similar experiences to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both being personally targeted and witnessing others being objectified was associated with a “substantial increase” in “self-objectification”, which can be defined as thinking about yourself as an object to be used, and the correlation was stronger when the individual was targeted themselves. This seemed to be true regardless of the women’s scores on the personality test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some limitations with the work. Though the researchers did show examples of the kinds of behaviours that they considered to be “objectifying”, not all women will perceive the same gaze, for example, in the same way. The paper also provided no detail on the sexual orientation of the women and the survey prompts didn’t allow them to indicate whether the person doing the objectifying was male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while increases in participants’ levels of self-objectification were clearly associated with the recent experience of objectifying events (at each survey point, participants were first asked to report on their feelings of self-objectification and then whether they’d experienced any objectification since the last prompt – i.e. over the past hour or two), it’s theoretically possible that if some women were generally thinking more about themselves as objects to be used, they may have noticed more objectifying gazes, for example, than they would otherwise have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study certainly does show that while the women in this study may not have experienced sexual harassment on the same scale as recorded in the 2014 video, these kinds of events – for young women in Melbourne, at least – are very common.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Type III CRISPR–Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/m7hd0PfAYkk/nature23467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In many prokaryotes, type III CRISPR–Cas systems detect and degrade invasive genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference complex. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone ribonuclease that degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding by the interference complex, its Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CARF domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10 Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to an unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cysteine protease cathepsin B mediates radiation-induced bystander effects</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5qk-6hQGCiA/nature23284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) refers to a unique process in which factors released by irradiated cells or tissues exert effects on other parts of the animal not exposed to radiation, causing genomic instability, stress responses and altered apoptosis or cell proliferation. Although RIBEs have important implications for radioprotection, radiation safety and radiotherapy, the molecular identities of RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model in which to study RIBEs, and identify the cysteine protease CPR-4, a homologue of human cathepsin B, as the first RIBE factor in nematodes, to our knowledge. CPR-4 is secreted from animals irradiated with ultraviolet or ionizing gamma rays, and is the major factor in the conditioned medium that leads to the inhibition of cell death and increased embryonic lethality in unirradiated animals. Moreover, CPR-4 causes these effects and stress responses at unexposed sites distal to the irradiated tissue. The activity of CPR-4 is regulated by the p53 homologue CEP-1 in response to radiation, and CPR-4 seems to exert RIBEs by acting through the insulin-like growth factor receptor DAF-2. Our study provides crucial insights into RIBEs, and will facilitate the identification of additional RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and aldolase mediate glucose sensing by AMPK</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5jAV6FmAnH8/nature23275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The major energy source for most cells is glucose, from which ATP is generated via glycolysis and/or oxidative metabolism. Glucose deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but it is unclear whether this activation occurs solely via changes in AMP or ADP, the classical activators of AMPK. Here, we describe an AMP/ADP-independent mechanism that triggers AMPK activation by sensing the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), with AMPK being progressively activated as extracellular glucose and intracellular FBP decrease. When unoccupied by FBP, aldolases promote the formation of a lysosomal complex containing at least v-ATPase, ragulator, axin, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPK, which has previously been shown to be required for AMPK activation. Knockdown of aldolases activates AMPK even in cells with abundant glucose, whereas the catalysis-defective D34S aldolase mutant, which still binds FBP, blocks AMPK activation. Cell-free reconstitution assays show that addition of FBP disrupts the association of axin and LKB1 with v-ATPase and ragulator. Importantly, in some cell types AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios remain unchanged during acute glucose starvation, and intact AMP-binding sites on AMPK are not required for AMPK activation. These results establish that aldolase, as well as being a glycolytic enzyme, is a sensor of glucose availability that regulates AMPK.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Immunotherapy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade is effective in only a minority of patients with cancer, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Here we use a pooled in vivo genetic screening approach using CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in transplantable tumours in mice treated with immunotherapy to discover previously undescribed immunotherapy targets. We tested 2,368 genes expressed by melanoma cells to identify those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade. We recovered the known immune evasion molecules PD-L1 and CD47, and confirmed that defects in interferon-γ signalling caused resistance to immunotherapy. Tumours were sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of genes involved in several diverse pathways, including NF-κB signalling, antigen presentation and the unfolded protein response. In addition, deletion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 in tumour cells increased the efficacy of immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation and growth suppression. In vivo genetic screens in tumour models can identify new immunotherapy targets in unanticipated pathways.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 adopts a novel tetrameric architecture</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/sjz8l78s4SM/nature23269</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 TMEM175 is a lysosomal K+ channel that is important for maintaining the membrane potential and pH stability in lysosomes. It contains two homologous copies of a six-transmembrane-helix (6-TM) domain, which has no sequence homology to the canonical tetrameric K+ channels and lacks the TVGYG selectivity filter motif found in these channels. The prokaryotic TMEM175 channel, which is present in a subset of bacteria and archaea, contains only a single 6-TM domain and functions as a tetramer. Here, we present the crystal structure of a prokaryotic TMEM175 channel from Chamaesiphon minutus, CmTMEM175, the architecture of which represents a completely different fold from that of canonical K+ channels. All six transmembrane helices of CmTMEM175 are tightly packed within each subunit without undergoing domain swapping. The highly conserved TM1 helix acts as the pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in the channel tetramer. Three layers of hydrophobic residues on the carboxy-terminal half of the TM1 helices form a bottleneck along the ion conduction pathway and serve as the selectivity filter of the channel. Mutagenesis analysis suggests that the first layer of the highly conserved isoleucine residues in the filter is primarily responsible for channel selectivity. Thus, the structure of CmTMEM175 represents a novel architecture of a tetrameric cation channel whose ion selectivity mechanism appears to be distinct from that of the classical K+ channel family.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Maternal H3K27me3 controls DNA methylation-independent imprinting</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Mammalian sperm and oocytes have different epigenetic landscapes and are organized in different fashions. After fertilization, the initially distinct parental epigenomes become largely equalized with the exception of certain loci, including imprinting control regions. How parental chromatin becomes equalized and how imprinting control regions escape from this reprogramming is largely unknown. Here we profile parental allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in mouse zygotes and morula embryos, and investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these allelic sites. Integrated analyses of DNA methylome and tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identify 76 genes with paternal allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites that are devoid of DNA methylation but harbour maternal allele-specific H3K27me3. Interestingly, these genes are paternally expressed in preimplantation embryos, and ectopic removal of H3K27me3 induces maternal allele expression. H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is largely lost in the embryonic cell lineage, but at least five genes maintain their imprinted expression in the extra-embryonic cell lineage. The five genes include all paternally expressed autosomal imprinted genes previously demonstrated to be independent of oocyte DNA methylation. Thus, our study identifies maternal H3K27me3 as a DNA methylation-independent imprinting mechanism.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Distinct timescales of population coding across cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/j3SSeQ-ew7M/nature23020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance, sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds, whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively, and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the accuracy of behaviour.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The whole-genome landscape of medulloblastoma subtypes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gmzYR07rHy4/nature22973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Current therapies for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant childhood brain tumour, impose debilitating effects on the developing child, and highlight the need for molecularly targeted treatments with reduced toxicity. Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and ‘enhancer hijacking’ events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma.

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/RWIQH8AxZMY/nature22968</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The time of arrival of people in Australia is an unresolved question. It is relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals, Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the extinction of Australia’s megafauna. Here we report the results of new excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia. Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans.

&lt;p&gt;No sooner had the American Psychological Association released their 2015 task force report supposedly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games.aspx&quot;&gt;confirming&lt;/a&gt; that violent video games make players aggressive than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/apa-video-games-violence-364394&quot;&gt;the criticisms&lt;/a&gt; of the report started pouring in, of bias and bad practice. On the issue of whether violent games breed real-world aggression, there’s not much that you can say for certain except that there’s a lot of disagreement among experts. So of course, one more study is not going to settle this long-running debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain Imaging and Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; does do is provide a good test of a key argument made by the “violent games cause aggression” camp, namely that over time, excessive violent gameplay desensitises the emotional responsiveness of players. Using brain scanning to look for emotional desensitisation at a neural level, Gregor Szycik at Hannover Medical School and his colleagues in fact found no evidence that excessive players of violent video games are emotionally blunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26930&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two studies, each of which compared 14 excessive players of violent first-person shooter games (such as Call of Duty and Battlefield) with 14 controls who never played violent games. The average age of the participants was 22 to 23 and they were all male. The violent video game players really did invest a lot of time shooting people on-screen: in the first study, they averaged 4.9 hours violent game-play per day, and in the second study they averaged 4.6 hours daily play. They’d also been playing these games since they were six years old, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two studies were very similar: the participants lay in a brain scanner and looked at a range of emotionally positive, negative and neutral photos, most of which came from the well-used International Affective Picture System. The negative images in this series are pretty grim and include things like dead bodies or graphic, violent attacks. The positive images include cute animals, and an example of a neutral image would be a natural vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at emotional pictures led to larger increases in brain activity compared with neutral pictures, just as you’d expect, especially in neural regions responsible for emotional processing. But the key finding is that this effect didn’t vary by group: the violent video game players showed just as much neural sensitivity to the emotional pictures as the control participants. This was true even when the researchers relaxed the statistical parameters (to make it easier to find a group difference), when they lumped all the data together from the two studies, and when they zoomed in on the amygdala, a part of the brain that plays an important role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest [a need] to rethink the desensitisation hypothesis,” the researchers said. They added that this does not mean there are no consequences to playing violent video games: for instance, one possibility is that playing violent games affects how players act in response to emotional stimuli, rather than how their brains initially process such stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings build on earlier research that’s shown it’s important not to make sweeping statements on this topic: for instance, the psychological effects of violent video gameplay could depend on the character you play (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/07/effects-of-a-violent-video-game-depend-on-whether-youre-superman-or-the-joker/&quot;&gt;Superman or the Joker, for example&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21487/abstract&quot;&gt;the goals of the game&lt;/a&gt;, and in some instances violent play could even lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/01/06/could-violent-video-games-make-players-more-moral-in-the-real-world/&quot;&gt;enhanced moral emotions&lt;/a&gt;. The new results also follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00174/full&quot;&gt;similar findings&lt;/a&gt; from the same research group published earlier this year using line drawings of emotional versus neutral situations.&lt;/p&gt;

She is also Vice president of the Council of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT), Editor of the journal &lt;em&gt;Phytokeys&lt;/em&gt;, and a member of the Editorial Board of &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you briefly explain the changes that were made to the rules surrounding naming of new plant species at the 2011 IBC congress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every six years at International Botanical Congresses (IBC) a group of scientists who study algae, fungi and plants gather to review and change the rules for naming (nomenclature). The Nomenclature Section at the IBC in Melbourne six years ago made a big change to media allowed for publishing new nomenclatural acts (new names and the like) – previously if you wanted to describe a new species, for example, you would have to do it in a print journal (or book) and only once the journal was printed was the name available for others to use. In Melbourne, the assembled scientists voted to allow publication in journals and books that were only published electronically – no longer did we have to publish only in print media, or wait until the paper was printed on paper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;no longer did we have to publish only in print media, or wait until the paper was printed on paper!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you personally so keen on seeing these changes made?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxonomy is often seen as a dusty, old-fashioned science, and clinging to print-on-paper as the publishing world itself was moving into the electronic realm only re-enforced that image. I personally felt there was a real danger that taxonomic publications would be relegated to fewer and fewer places, that were less and less accessible to most people. For me, accessibility was also important, many of the specialist publications are not available outside rich Western institutions, and taxonomy needs to be done everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversely, why were these changes seen by some taxonomists as so controversial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even though the publishing world was slowly (or quickly) going electronic, many people were concerned about the permanency of works that were produced only electronically. Taxonomy depends upon being able to access the literature of the past, and some felt that safeguards were not well-developed and that proper archives didn’t yet exist. There were also fears about unscrupulous folk going in and changing e-published works, and about the possible disenfranchisement of those with minimal access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9286 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1127&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/800px-Haeckel_Orchidae.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long had these debates been going on in the taxonomic community? Was there a specific reason why the changes were finally passed at the 2011 congress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first proposals to allow e-publishing what was then called the Botanical Code (it’s now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants) were made to the IBC in Vienna in 2005. Although there was some support for the change, the particular way in which it was proposed was voted down. A Special Committee was then set up to further refine the changes and bring them to the Melbourne Congress. They worked for six years to make the proposal that eventually was accepted by an over-whelming majority in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on your new research, what is your assessment of the early impact of these changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, contrary to our expectations, the changes have basically had little effect on the publishing behaviour of scientists working with naming of plants. Because e-publication is now permitted as just another instance of publishing (much like it is in the publishing industry itself) taxonomists just kept on publishing in the normal way, but had a wider range of places open to them. There were not huge numbers of “rogue” journals, but conversely, the rate of species description did not speed up either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying that today, e-publication is seen as publication…. not peculiar, not outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six years on, do you feel that the taxonomic community has broadly come to accept these changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying that today, e-publication is seen as publication…. not peculiar, not outlandish. There are teething problems for sure – date of publication not on the pdf copy, no page numbers (this upsets some), or uncertainty in some journals whether the e-version is actually the final Version of record (the one that doesn’t change). But overall, the number of taxonomists publishing electronically is going up and to me this says that it is now accepted by most of us. If we all work together as a community, publishers and publishes alike, these problems will be ironed out – hopefully long before the publishing world turns its back on print-on-paper forever.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Cleaning up a public health threat – the River Ganges</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/17/cleaning-up-a-public-health-threat-the-river-ganges/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ganges-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ganga – the holy river&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, India’s National Green Tribunal issued new, strict regulations aimed at cleaning up one of the most the polluted rivers in the world – the Ganges, or Ganga in the vernacular. According to Indian mythology, the Mother Ganges is a goddess who long ago descended from the sky to resurrect the ashes of an ancient king’s ancestors. Any Hindu who dips in or drinks from her is freed from a great deal of karmic debt. Furthermore, anyone whose  remains are scattered in her escapes immediately from the cycle of reincarnation. She is also the most respectful resting place for the carcasses of cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a water source for an estimated 400 million people, the river is home to industrial waste, sewage and human and animal remains which pose significant threats to human health. Hinduism beliefs about the holiness of the water are powerful enough to neutralise any warnings of health risks, making any public health interventions even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week’s announcement is not the first time attempts have been made at cleaning up the river. Shortly after Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014, he pledged to lead efforts to reduce pollution by building more treatment plants and moving more than 400 tanneries away from the river. But that estimated $3 billion clean-up plan has never come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulations announced last week state that no waste can be dumped within half a kilometre of the river’s edge, and that any littering of any sort will invoke an instant fine of 50,000 rupees.  No construction will be allowed within 100 meters of the river and 456 tannery units, which release effluent into the water, should be moved away from the river within the next six weeks. If they are not relocated, they will be closed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water-borne diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Ganges may be considered holy, major health risks are transmitted to the human population either by direct bathing in the dirty water or by drinking. Fecal coliform counts in the water are dangerously high and disease risks include hepatitis, typhoid, cholera, amoebic dysentery and a variety of skin afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, there were an estimated 1.3 billion people at risk for cholera in 69 countries classified as cholera-endemic, with India being among the countries with the highest number of people at risk.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/&quot;&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt; is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae.&lt;/em&gt; During the 19th century, the disease spread across the world from its original reservoir in the Ganges delta.  It is raising its head again in India this year and experts predict the disease will only become more frequent due to the added effects of climate change. If people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, for certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within a mere two hours of becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/topics/dysentery/en/&quot;&gt;Dysentery&lt;/a&gt; is a type of gastroenteritis that results in diarrhea with blood. Like cholera, dysentery is spread by fecal contamination of food and water and is usually prevalent in areas with poor sanitation. Worldwide, approximately 140 million people develop dysentery each year, and about 600,000 die.  Over 60 percent of these fatalities are children under 5 years old in developing countries. There are two main types of the disease: bacillary dysentery and amebic dysentery.  The latter is carried by the river Ganges and is caused by &lt;em&gt;Entamoeba histolytica&lt;/em&gt;, an ameba.  In areas of poor sanitation, the ameba can contaminate food and water and, as they can survive for long periods outside the body, infect other humans. They can also linger on people’s hands after using the bathroom, implying that good hygiene can reduce the risk of spreading infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/&quot;&gt;Typhoid&lt;/a&gt; occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water.  It is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhi &lt;/em&gt;and can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. It is an important public health challenge for India where it is most common, particularly among young children and especially with the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Typhoid can easily be prevented by following simple rules including proper hygiene and sanitation and persistent hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the river also led to the development of water-borne superbugs – New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-1 and NDM-4 which spread at an alarming rate, leading to a warning sparked by the World Health Organization two years later. Not only is waste contaminating the river’s water and leading to disease risk but it is also assisting in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contaminated water causes millions of cases of these diseases every year. Results of epidemiological studies assessing the relationship between the quality of water supply and sanitation versus human health vary widely and there are severe methodological difficulties involved in undertaking such studies.  One of the main reasons for these difficulties is that the fecal-oral route includes multiple routes for infection. However, there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that key to controlling these diseases is improved sanitation, the provision of clean water and the installation and maintenance of proper sewage systems or treatment facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance fluctuates throughout the day. Depending on their “chronotype” some people are sharpest in the morning (“larks”), while others generally prefer the later hours of the day (“owls”). For obvious reasons, this is mirrored in our preferred sleep routines: larks get tired in the evenings earlier and, as a consequence, also wake up earlier, while owls show the opposite pattern. Your chronotype is not something that you’re stuck with for the rest of your life, but it changes with age. In fact we’re most likely to show an owl-like chronotype during adolescence, which might at least partly explain why teenagers often stay up late and arrive at school with eyes bloodshot thanks to a hefty sleep debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if late chronotypes are so common in adolescents, why does school start so early (usually well before 9am in the UK, Netherlands and Germany)? Doesn’t that mean that many students are likely to be constantly sleep-deprived and not assessed during their biological peaks? Yes, it does! In fact, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that school kids who have a late chronotype score lower grades. But besides reduced sleep time, there are several alternative explanations for why a late chronotype could be associated with lower academic performance (such as absenteeism, for instance) as explored in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04076-y&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports. &lt;/i&gt;The researchers, led by Giulia Zerbini at University of Groningen, say their findings might help us understand the chronotype/school grade link and how we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26902&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected more than 40,000 individual exam grades across multiple school subjects from 523 pupils (aged 11 to 17) at various Dutch secondary schools. They also assessed the chronotype of the students with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) which asked them several questions about their sleep habits, including what time they went to bed, fell asleep and woke on school days compared with the weekend. These data also made it possible to calculate social jetlag, which is a rough measure of the misalignment between biological and social clocks. For example, imagine you are generally not sleepy until midnight but that you have a job that means you have to be in the office from 7am: you are likely to be at risk of developing social jetlag because it will be difficult for you to get enough sleep to fit in with your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did owls in this study get lower grades? Yes, they did. In fact, the negative association between having a late chronotype and poorer school performance was similar to the association between absenteeism from school and poorer grades! For every hour a student’s chronotype ran later, grades dropped by 0.06 (on the 0-10 Dutch grading scale). Interestingly, this effect was largely independent of sleep duration, suggesting that even when owls got enough sleep, they still performed poorly compared with larks, perhaps because of their difficulty performing at their best during certain school hours. Consistent with this, they actually achieved similar grades to larks when they took the exam in the afternoon, nearer to their own optimal time of day. A similar pattern was also seen for the association between later chronotype and having an increased risk of dismissal from class, late arrival and social jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more interesting pattern emerged when the researchers looked at school subjects separately. A later chronotype was associated with poorer performance in science (except physics), but not in humanities/linguistic subjects (in contrast, absenteeism had universally negative associations with grades). The apparently subject-specific relevance of chronotype chimes with previous studies suggesting that chronotype and time-of-day variation in performance have the most pronounced effects in areas demanding fluid intelligence, such as mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings should give policy makers food for thought. For example, they reiterate the common observation that adolescents often have late chronotypes and that early school schedules do not match their needs. And it’s not simply their fault for not going to bed early enough – often, their circadian rhythm is to blame just as much! It is promising that some British schools have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10818678/School-introduces-no-mornings-policy-for-tired-teenagers.html&quot;&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8579951.stm&quot;&gt;trialling&lt;/a&gt; later start times. Even if there is no room for modification in terms of school times, at least it could be a good idea for schools to consider postponing science subjects and exams until after lunch. Of course, this won’t transform every pupil into a potential Oxbridge graduate. But, at least it might make some of them feel less tired and help them perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04076-y&quot;&gt;Lower school performance in late chronotypes: underlying factors and mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A “self” with the capacity for autobiographical memory and complex thought? Traditionally, the field of cognitive science has been concerned with explaining the mind in isolation from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The growing field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;embodied cognition&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, seeks to rejoin them. One major strand has focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705682&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;grounded cognition&quot;&gt;grounding&lt;/a&gt; higher-order semantics and language understanding in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301525&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;perceptual symbol systems&quot;&gt;perceptual&lt;/a&gt; and sensory-motor representations. This view is distinct from theories of knowledge based on abstract, amodal representations divorced from sensory-motor experience. Another wing of the embodied approach is concerned with how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v3/n8/full/nrn894.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interoception&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the inner sense of your physical state &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; grounds your feelings and emotions in the body. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n2/full/nn1176.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Interoceptive awareness&lt;/a&gt; of visceral functions such as heartbeat has been related to core consciousness and awareness of self, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416308053&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A relatively neglected yet critical aspect of any grand theory of the embodied self is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Vestibular_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vestibular system&lt;/a&gt;. The vestibular system is the set of sensory organs responsible for maintaining our balance and keeping our visual field in a stable position while our head moves around. These organs are located in the inner ear and include...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...two &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;otolith&lt;/a&gt; organs (the saccule and utricle), which sense linear  acceleration (i.e., gravity and translational movements), and the three  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semicircular canals&lt;/a&gt;, which sense angular acceleration in three planes.  The receptor cells of the otoliths and semicircular canals send signals  through the vestibular nerve fibers to the neural structures that control eye movements, posture, and balance. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quote above is from &lt;span class=&quot;subpages&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Vestibular_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kathleen Cullen and Soroush Sadeghi (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, who have an excellent review on the vestibular system in &lt;i&gt;Scholarpedia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eZcwRdUD2yM/WWu9q3u5zOI/AAAAAAAAMNc/z5YPAp30J_EoGY5wBApacvm9hZ8bg5p7wCLcBGAs/s1600/Vestibular_system.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;904&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1056&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eZcwRdUD2yM/WWu9q3u5zOI/AAAAAAAAMNc/z5YPAp30J_EoGY5wBApacvm9hZ8bg5p7wCLcBGAs/s400/Vestibular_system.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We take the vestibular system for granted until something goes wrong, like motion sickness (a mismatch of movement perceived by the vestibular and visual systems) or a rare disorder of the inner ear such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s_disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'characterized by episodes of feeling like the world is spinning (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a fullness in the ear'&quot;&gt;Menière’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. But how can a dysfunction of the inner ear influence our sense of self?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/77/6/760.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song, Jáuregui-Renaud, and colleagues (2008)&lt;/a&gt; looked at symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;depersonalization&lt;/a&gt; (a feeling of detachment from oneself) in 50 patients with peripheral vestibular disease and 121 healthy controls. The participants were given the Depersonalization/Derealization Inventory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112722&quot;&gt;Cox and Swinson (2002)&lt;/a&gt; to assess symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140313163001/http://www.dissociative-identity-disorder.net/wiki/Depersonalization_Disorder&quot; title=&quot;Depersonalization Disorder&quot;&gt;these conditions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip_abbr&quot;&gt;detachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,   or being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings,   sensations, body, or actions (e.g.,perceptual alterations, distorted   sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical   numbing.)&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip_abbr&quot;&gt;Derealization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:   &quot;Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings   (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike,   foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the expected high frequency of dizziness, the patients were much more likely to experience feelings of Shifting Ground, Spaced Out, Body Feels Strange, and Not Being in Control of Self than were controls (see bottom half of the figure below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cp_SGt4B6cc/WWvHMd2nQBI/AAAAAAAAMNk/uNxxYGdhtFQPZiWFkClmAuIQ7Z9SBYdGACLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2B1_DD%2BSymptoms.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;683&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cp_SGt4B6cc/WWvHMd2nQBI/AAAAAAAAMNk/uNxxYGdhtFQPZiWFkClmAuIQ7Z9SBYdGACLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2B1_DD%2BSymptoms.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors suggest that abnormal vestibular signals disrupt the relationship of the self to the environment, leading to strange feelings of detachment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Vestibular disease causes primary symptoms of vertigo and feelings that the ground is unstable ... which are more marked in distinct, acute episodes. These immediate symptoms are, by definition, unreal experiences since the body is not spinning and the ground is not heaving, but they are readily understandable as perceptions derived directly from abnormal sensory signals. Vestibular dysfunction could also compromise more general precepts of stable relationships between the self and the environment...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization can be induced experimentally in healthy people via &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003429.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caloric stimulation&lt;/a&gt;. This procedure is used medically to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314478&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vestibulo-ocular reflex&lt;/a&gt;, which stabilizes the visual image while the head is moving. The test involves delivering warm or cold water into the ear canal and observing the resultant eye movements (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/77/6/760.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song et al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt; administered caloric stimulation to 20 of their vestibular patients and 20 controls. After stimulation, many healthy participants reported feelings of detachment/separation from their surroundings (40%), and that their body feels strange/different (50%). These were novel experiences for most. Conversely, the patients reported no such changes after stimulation because they already experience these symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An even more extreme way to stimulate the vestibular system is through &lt;a href=&quot;http://naukarus.com/reliability-of-utricular-function-testing-using-a-sinusoidal-translation-profile-during-unilateral-centrifugation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unilateral centrifugation &lt;/a&gt;(i.e., spinning around in a specialized chair).

The target of this test differs from the caloric procedure, which stimulates the semicircular canals. The utricles and the semicircular canals detect different types of motion (linear  acceleration and angular acceleration, respectively), and the authors wanted to see if unilateral centrifugation would produce the same effects as caloric stimulation. And indeed, after centrifugation, symptoms of depersonalization and derealization were reported with increased frequency &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;— &lt;/span&gt;e.g., Surroundings seem strange and unreal; Time seems to pass very slowly; Body feels strange or different in some way (see Table below for details).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-05-S4Df7hmY/WMszCpXNXaI/AAAAAAAAMFI/uXB0Y-qy-5UaI_oFX16cFzqUCCSMWaO7QCLcB/s1600/Depersonalization_derealization%2Bsymptoms.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-05-S4Df7hmY/WMszCpXNXaI/AAAAAAAAMFI/uXB0Y-qy-5UaI_oFX16cFzqUCCSMWaO7QCLcB/s400/Depersonalization_derealization%2Bsymptoms.png&quot; width=&quot;343&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;modified from Table 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-vestibular-research/ves597&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aranda-Moreno &amp;amp; Jáuregui-Renaud, 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; Frequency (Freq) and severity (score range) for each of the symptoms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112722&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cox and Swinson (2002)&lt;/a&gt; depersonalization/derealization inventory reported by 100 subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results provide further evidence that the vestibular system contributes to the construction of the self. The sense of inhabiting one's body is assembled from many different inputs, of course. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017305000792&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can go awry&lt;/a&gt; in epilepsy, migraine, focal brain injury, psychiatric disturbances, and under extreme stress. Although rare, out-of-body experiences are more frequent in persons who suffer from dizziness due to vestibular disorders (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217301892&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lopez &amp;amp; Elzière, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).

	<content:encoded>It appears that memes and science don't mix well. A pair of researchers have published an apology in a peer-reviewed journal - for using the word &quot;derpy&quot; in an earlier paper.



In April 2016, Archives of Sexual Behavior published a piece called Fighting the Derpy Science of Sexuality by Banu Subramaniam and Angela Willey.



In this paper, Subramaniam and Willey criticized studies of biological differences between human groups:

	<title>Brain Blogger: New Breakthroughs in Concussion Diagnostics</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/14/new-breakthroughs-in-concussion-diagnostics/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury. While serious concussions present with overt symptoms, the diagnosis of mild concussions remains a clinical difficulty. Researchers recently developed two novel methods for the diagnosis of concussion that may aid in the identification of less severe traumatic brain injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/06/new-game-like-technology-helps-assess-concussions/&quot;&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively common traumatic brain injury caused by a fall or blow to the head that results in a temporary impairment of brain function. Loss of consciousness is common, but contrary to popular belief, it is not a requirement for diagnosis. Typical indicators include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, headache, and memory impairment, among other neurological symptoms. These symptoms usually persist for a few months, but some patients continue to experience cognitive and behavioral manifestations long after the initial injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection of concussion using objective, quantitative methods remains a clinical challenge. Traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/16/looking-inside-our-heads-brain-imaging-and-patient-adherence/&quot;&gt;brain imaging techniques&lt;/a&gt;, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are not sensitive enough for this application. Therefore, diagnosis is usually made using non-objective methods such as patient interviews and self-assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers led by Margot Taylor at Simon Fraser University have developed a n&lt;a href=&quot;http://10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004914&quot;&gt;ew method&lt;/a&gt; for detecting mild traumatic brain injuries using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging. The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;. Taylor and colleagues are members of the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Institute and the ImageTech Lab at SFU, home to the only research-dedicated MEG scanners in western Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEG imaging is a technique that measures the magnetic fields generated by brain activity. It has excellent spatial and temporal resolution and can identify events with millimeter and millisecond precision. MEG imaging can be used to map the interaction among various brain areas. Importantly for clinical applications, MEG imaging is completely noninvasive, and can be used in both adults and children without harmful radiation exposure, or the need to inject isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury is associated with damage to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/03/14/shifting-paradigms-of-white-matter-diseases/&quot;&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; of the brain, made up of bundles of nerve axons that connect one brain area to another. When two brain areas are connected, they show activity pattern synchronization, referred to as oscillatory network synchrony. The researchers hypothesized that by using MEG imaging to measure network synchrony, they could identify small disruptions in the connections between brain areas that result from traumatic brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEG scans were performed on patients who were diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in the prior three months, and on healthy controls. Computer analyses were performed to calculate several indices of network connectivity, and significant differences were found between patients and controls. The differences were stronger when less time had elapsed between the injury and the imaging procedure. Overall, MEG imaging was able to detect the presence of a mild concussion with 88% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;a href=&quot;http://10.1038/srep39009&quot;&gt;10.1038/srep39009″&amp;gt;groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt;, a group of researchers led by Nina Kraus and Cynthia LaBella of the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University have developed an approach for diagnosing concussion using an auditory biomarker. Their work was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing of sound by the brain is a complex process that involves interaction among the cognitive, sensory, and limbic systems. Damage to any of these brain systems should therefore interrupt &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/09/22/hearing-voices-underpinnings-of-auditory-hallucinations/&quot;&gt;auditory processing&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers proposed. The question Kraus and colleagues asked was whether concussion-induced changes in sound processing would be large enough to distinguish between patients with a concussion and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this question, the researchers measured speech-evoked frequency-following responses (FFRs) in 40 children with and without a concussion. The FFR is generated by the auditory center of the brain, and it incorporates cognitive, sensory, and reward input. Changes in the FFR have previously been associated with other clinical syndromes. Importantly, the FFR can be easily measured by placing electrodes on the scalp and delivering a sound stimulus into the ear. The FFR measurement is highly reliable and is consistent across the lifespan within an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children who had sustained concussion were tested an average of 27 days after their injury. Neurophysiological responses were measured in terms of the magnitude, timing, accuracy, and pitch processing of the fundamental frequency of speech (F0). Children with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/05/14/jury-still-out-on-after-effects-of-concussion/&quot;&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; exhibited on average a 35% smaller response to the F0 than the controls. They also showed impaired pitch coding, and smaller and slower brain responses to speech. These measures were correlated with the number of concussion symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers created a statistical model incorporating these data. Their model was able to classify subjects into concussion or control groups with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity, suggesting that the observed changes in auditory processing are an accurate biomarker of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers cite the portability, reliability, and accuracy of their test as major advantages for its clinical application in diagnosing new injuries. Baseline readings could be made in athletes who participate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/08/sports-concussion-new-testing-methods-are-imperative/&quot;&gt;impact sports&lt;/a&gt;, and repeat measures could be taken at the end of the season or following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with MEG imaging, this method provides an objective and quantitative means for diagnosing brain dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury. These methods will be useful both for identifying patients with mild injuries, and for developing guidelines for recovery and the return to work and play following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Prevention Is the Best Medicine for Dementia</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/14/prevention-is-the-best-medicine-for-dementia/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Population aging is bringing about a substantial increase in the prevalence of neurocognitive disorders. Current projections estimate that, by 2050, more that 130 million people will be affected by dementia worldwide. As experts assemble to devise strategies to face this incoming challenge, one conclusion stands out: prevention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of prevention is obvious: to promote good health and take action before disease onset, thereby reducing the incidence of disease. And this is obviously better than having to manage a disease and its complications, and losing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/04/pursuing-happiness-doesnt-have-to-promote-depression-in-others/&quot;&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; – “prevention is better than cure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order for preventive behaviors to be acquired, knowledge is essential – knowledge of modifiable risk factors and preemptive actions that can be adopted, and knowledge of how effective they really are. Studies addressing the benefit of lifestyle interventions for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/06/12/nsaids-prevention-or-just-delay-of-dementia/&quot;&gt;prevention of dementia&lt;/a&gt; have identified numerous modifiable risk and protective factors and have shown that change can indeed be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment include lifestyle factors such as smoking, high alcohol intake, diet (saturated fats, sugar, processed foods), and poor physical activity; these then manifest in other risk factors that are already a consequence of inadequate lifestyle options, namely vascular and metabolic diseases (cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, overweight and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/28/effect-of-obesity-on-human-brain/&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol). In the end, it all builds up to speed up cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protective factors include opposite lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking, moderate alcohol intake, healthier diet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/08/04/the-health-benefits-of-a-mediterranean-diet/&quot;&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, polyunsaturated fatty acids and fish-related fats, vitamins B6 and B12, folate, antioxidant vitamins (A, C and E), vitamin D, physical activity, and mentally stimulating activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, cognitive disorders are complex, multifactorial conditions – even if you lead the healthiest life, dementia may still strike you. But this should not be an excuse to let go because research shows is that preventive behaviors shift the odds in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of behavioral change is that it should be integrative. Single-domain interventions provide some benefit: physical activity and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/15/brain-training-can-we-really-enhance-our-cognitive-skills/&quot;&gt;cognitive training &lt;/a&gt;have been positively associated with cognitive performance in multiple studies; also, a recent meta-analysis showed that an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. But multi-domain interventions, in which multiple risk factors are targeted simultaneously are more likely to deliver better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 2015 Finnish study assessed the effect of a 2-year multimodal intervention in adults aged 60-77 years at risk of cognitive decline but without pronounced cognitive impairment. Four intervention targets were included: diet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/19/high-intensity-interval-training-and-brain-health/&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive training, and vascular risk. The program’s design included a diet with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, consumption of wholegrain cereal products and low-fat milk and meat products, low sucrose intake, use of vegetable margarine and rapeseed oil instead of butter, and fish consumption at least two portions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical exercise training program included progressive muscle strength training, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/11/exercise-boosts-brain-power/&quot;&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and exercises to improve postural balance. Cognitive training consisted of computer-based training targeting executive processes, working memory, episodic memory, and mental speed. Metabolic and vascular risk factors were monitored throughout the study. Social activities were also stimulated through the numerous group meetings of all intervention components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study showed that simultaneous changes in multiple risk factors, even of small magnitude, had beneficial effects on the risk of cognitive decline, on overall cognition, complex memory tasks, executive functioning and processing speed, and on also BMI, dietary habits, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a timely prevention seems fundamental – these lifestyle interventions may not be as effective once cognitive impairment is manifest. A recent study evaluated the impact of a 3-year &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/&quot;&gt;omega-3 fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; supplementation with or without multi-domain lifestyle interventions on cognitive function in adults aged 70 years or older. These adults already had symptoms of cognitive impairment: either memory complaints, limitations in one instrumental daily living activity, or slow gait speed. The multi-domain intervention included cognitive training, physical activity, nutrition, and management of cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, neither the omega-3 supplementation alone, nor the combination with the lifestyle interventions were able to reduce cognitive decline. Also, the adherence to lifestyle interventions over time was lower in this study when compared to other studies with younger seniors, with no clinical manifestations of dementia onset. But still, those with increased risk of dementia were the ones who benefited the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early prevention is probably the best strategy. Instead of trying to prevent dementia later in life, focusing on preventing earlier, milder, and more common forms of cognitive impairment may be a better strategy that may end up also preventing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and, ultimately, dementia. Because they’re all fruits from the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;
