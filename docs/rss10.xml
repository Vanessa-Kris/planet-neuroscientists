&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Look. You can’t plan out your life. What you have to do is first discover your passion—what you really care about&lt;/em&gt;.” Barack Obama, as quoted by David Gergen (cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;Jachimowicz et al, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Saturday Nov 17 in Newcastle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-newcastle-2018&quot;&gt;the first of two BPS careers events&lt;/a&gt; – “perfect for anyone looking to discover where psychology can take them in their chosen career.” A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;second follows in London&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 4. If, like many, you are searching for your calling in life – perhaps you are still unsure whether psychology is for you, or which area of the profession aligns with what you most care about – here are five digested research findings worth taking into consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35259&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a difference between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can find a career path or occupational goal that fires you up, you are more likely to succeed and find happiness through your work – that much we know from a deep research literature. But beware – since a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2003-08110-016&quot;&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 2003 by the Canadian psychologist Robert Vallerand and his colleagues, researchers have made an important distinction between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive one. If you feel that your passion or calling is out of control, and that your mood and self-esteem depend on it, then this is the obsessive variety, and such passions, while they are energising, are also associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;negative outcomes&lt;/a&gt; like burnout and anxiety. In contrast, if your passion feels in control, reflects qualities that you like about yourself, and complements other important activities in your life, then this is the harmonious version, which is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;positive outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, such as vitality, better work performance, experiencing flow, and positive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having an unanswered calling in life is worse than having no calling at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you already have a burning ambition or purpose, do not leave it to languish. A few years ago, researchers at the University of South Florida &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/07/follow-your-heart-having-an-unanswered-calling-in-life-is-worse-than-having-no-calling-at-all/&quot;&gt;surveyed hundreds of people&lt;/a&gt; and grouped them according to whether they felt like they had no calling in life, that they had a calling they’d answered, or they had a calling but had never done anything about it. In terms of their work engagement, career commitment, life satisfaction, health and stress, the stand-out finding was that the participants who had a calling they hadn’t answered scored the worst across all these measures. The researchers said this puts a different spin on the presumed benefits of having a calling in life. They concluded: “having a calling is only a benefit if it is met, but can be a detriment when it is not as compared to having no calling at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without passion, grit is “merely a grind”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All this talk of finding a passion, but you may also have heard that “grit” is vital for career success. As advanced most famously by psychologist Angela Duckworth, this is the idea that highly successful, gritty people have impressive persistence: “To be gritty,” Duckworth writes in her landmark book on the subject, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;is to fall down seven times, and rise eight&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s certainly true (many studies show) that being more conscientious – more self-disciplined and industrious – is associated with more career success. But is that all that being gritty means? Duckwork has always emphasised that it has another vital component that brings us back to passion again – alongside persistence, she says that gritty people also have an “ultimate concern” (another way of describing having a passion or calling). According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/9980&quot;&gt;a paper published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, however, the standard measure of grit has failed to assess passion (or more specifically, “passion attainment”) – and Jon Jachimowicz and his colleagues believe this could explain why the research on grit has been so inconsistent (leading to claims that it is an overhyped concept and simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/25/the-in-vogue-psychological-construct-grit-is-an-example-of-redundant-labelling-in-personality-psychology-claims-new-paper/&quot;&gt;conscientiousness repackaged&lt;/a&gt;). Jachimowicz’s team found that when they explicitly measured passion attainment (how much people feel they have adequate passion for their work) and combined this with a measure of perseverance (a consistency of interests and the ability to overcome setbacks), then the two together &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; predict superior performance among tech company employees and university students. “Our findings suggest that perseverance without passion attainment is mere drudgery, but perseverance with passion attainment propels individuals forward,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest enough effort and you may find that your work becomes your passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s all very well reading about the benefits of having a passion or calling in life, but if you haven’t got one, where to find it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;Duckwork says that it’s a mistake to think that in a moment of revelation one will land in your lap&lt;/a&gt;, or simply occur to you through quiet contemplation – rather you need to explore different activities and pursuits, and expose yourself the different challenges and needs confronting society. If you still draw a blank, then perhaps it’s worth heeding the advice of others who say that it is not always the case that energy and determination flow from finding your passion – sometimes it can be the other way around, and if you put enough energy into your work, then passion will follow. Consider, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/09/24/put-more-effort-into-a-project-and-youll-become-more-passionate-about-it/&quot;&gt;an eight-week repeated survey of German entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; published a few years ago that found a clear pattern – their passion for their ventures increased after they had invested more effort into the ventures the week before. A follow-up study qualified this, suggesting the energising effect of investing effort only arises when the project is freely chosen and there is a sense of progress. “Entrepreneurs increase their passion when they make significant progress in their venture and when they invest effort out of their own free choice,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think passion comes from doing a job you enjoy, you’re likely to be disappointed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another issue to consider is where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think passion comes from. In a paper released as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;preprint at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Jachimowicz and his team draw a distinction between people who believe that passion comes from doing what you enjoy (which they say is encapsulated by Oprah Winfrey’s commencement address in which she said passion “will bloom when we’re doing what we love”), and those who see it as arising from doing what you believe in or value in life (as reflected in the words of former Mexican President Felipe Calderón who in his own commencement address in 2011 said “you have to embrace with passion the things that you believe in, and that you are fighting for”). The researchers found that people believing that passion comes from pleasurable work were less likely to feel like they had found their passion (and were more likely to desire leaving their job) as compared with people who believe that passion comes from doing what you feel matters. Perhaps this is because there is a superficiality and ephemerality to working for sheer pleasure – what fits the bill one month or year may not do so for long – whereas working towards what you care about is a timeless endeavour that is likely to stretch and sustain you indefinitely. The researchers said their results showed: “the extent to which individuals attain their desired level of work passion may have less to do with their actual jobs and more to do with their beliefs about how work passion is pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe psychology might be your calling, the British Psychological Society is holding two careers events &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-newcastle-2018&quot;&gt;this weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;next month&lt;/a&gt;. Both are open to members (at a discount) and non-members.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;Brains might compute, but not digitally.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3tX8SxApeRHo7HwNBv19A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good question: Is the brain a computer? One thing that makes this a good question is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/how-to-find-out-if-your-brain-is-a-computer-644a1a4fed1b&quot;&gt;invites many further questions&lt;/a&gt;. Some people have taken the idea to be metaphorical: the brain is a computer in the same way that Juliet is the sun. That is just to say that it can be an illustrative way to think or talk about something, but not to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many do take it literally. My favorite example comes from the first sentence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/&quot;&gt;Christoph Koch&lt;/a&gt;’s book, &lt;em&gt;Biophysics of Computation&lt;/em&gt;: “Brains compute!’’ So what does it mean if we take this idea literally, too? What &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I’ll briefly look at some previous ideas about how brains might compute, then explore the role of analog computation for making sense of neural computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736&quot;&gt;explored in a previous blog post in this very forum&lt;/a&gt;, is that the brain is a computer because what it does can be described in terms of algorithms. Unfortunately, this view has some problems. One big one is that lots of things (maybe even everything) can be described algorithmically. If that’s true, then of course the brain is a computer, because everything is. But ideas that are trivially true aren’t very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not enough that something is merely &lt;em&gt;describable&lt;/em&gt; by an algorithm for it to be a computer. Perhaps we can say that the brain computes because it &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;runs&lt;/em&gt;, algorithms. Certainly not everything does that, even if everything is describable by an algorithm. Still, there is a problem with this idea. There’s a subtle, but important, distinction between being algorithmically describable and actually following an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example. Suppose I ask a child to write down a pattern of numbers, using the following rule. Start with 1, then add 3 to it and write that down, then add 5 to what you just wrote down, then add 7 to what you just wrote down, and so on. The child writes down 1, then 4, then 9, then 16, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the child is following an algorithm — the “add 3, then 5, then 7, etc.” rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we can describe what the child is doing in terms of another algorithm: the child is producing the squares of consecutive integers. There are two different algorithms that produce the same pattern (in fact, there are infinitely many such algorithms). In this example, we know which algorithm the child is following out of the many algorithms that describe the behavior. But in other cases, we might not know at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might not even make sense to think that the behavior of an organism is produced by following an algorithm at all, even if it is describable by some algorithm. For example, do single-celled organisms that move through increasing chemical gradients toward food really follow an algorithm? We know that computers can run algorithms depending on which program is running: these algorithms are stored and represented within the system. But for single-celled organisms, the “algorithm” is probably not represented anywhere: it’s just what the system does. But maybe it’s not a requirement that systems explicitly store and represent the algorithms they follow; however, that implies that objects falling due to gravity also follow algorithms! This does not seem like a happy result. These are all difficult and interesting questions, but for now, I will set them aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different problem with the idea of following algorithms is that what we usually mean by “algorithm” is entirely discrete. An algorithm consists of a finite series of discrete instructions, each of which takes some discrete amount of time. Turing’s work on the mathematical analysis of algorithms — and thus computation — assumes discrete time-steps and discrete variables (although, to be sure, “time’’ has to be understood abstractly as simply a succession of events, one after another, without particular units, such as milliseconds). Modern digital computers make the same assumptions. But we know that many elements of the brain are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; discrete: there are plenty of continuous quantities that seem to have an impact on what neurons do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s another problem. How we normally understand algorithms and computation is discrete through-and-through, but we know brains sometimes use continuous variables and processes. Even though we can &lt;em&gt;simulate&lt;/em&gt; continuous quantities digitally, that does not mean that continuous processes just &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other problems, but rather than going through them all, I think it’s better to look at a different way forward. But to get there, we have to take a moment to think carefully about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-010-9562-8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; really means, and what &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; mean&lt;/a&gt; — as well as how they can come apart. The upshot is that we can re-discover a way to think about computation that can be applied to computation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Representation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the brain as an analog computer makes a lot of sense, but first we have to be clear about what exactly that means. Some have entertained this idea, but under the mistaken idea that “analog” is just synonymous with “continuous.” One thought along these lines is that, because continuous quantities can be simulated digitally, analog computation is not worth taking seriously. However, there is much more to analog computation, and for those of us who want to understand how (or even if) brains compute, we should try to understand different types of computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to get a handle on analog representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of what “analog’’ means, they think it just means continuous. In fact, the terms “analog’’ and “continuous’’ are often used interchangeably (although sometimes people also use “analog’’ to mean not-digital, or not on a computer, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletjournal.com&quot;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/10/editorial-keep-shopping-week-analog&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;). However, a bit of reflection, plus a closer look at how analog computers actually operate, shows that this is not right. Instead, here’s the key idea:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analog representation is about &lt;em&gt;covariation&lt;/em&gt;, not continuity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some examples of simple analog devices. A mercury thermometer is a good one (although mercury has largely been replaced by alcohol). What makes this kind of thermometer analog, rather than digital? The way it works is simple: the thermometer represents temperature, and as the temperature increases, so does the level of liquid in the thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/1*0cvcV0i9pU-O67Ng0sdUKg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog thermometer.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is the second hand of an analog clock. The way it works is also simple: the hand represents time, and as time increases, so does the angle of the second hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/384/1*mDuUVaoQua9Qi99ZIuWZqA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog clock: as time increases, so do the angles of the hands.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both of these examples, the device represents something: temperature for the thermometer, and time for the watch. Also, in both of these examples, that representation is &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Simply put, because there is an analogy between the representation and what it represents. Specifically, as the thing that’s being represented increases, the physical property that’s &lt;em&gt;doing the representing&lt;/em&gt; also increases. And by increase, I mean a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; increase: an increase in the height of the liquid in the thermometer, and an increase in the angle of the second hand (with respect to 12, or straight up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But angles and heights are continuous, right? I just said that continuity is not what being analog is all about. But think about that analog clock again. Some electric clocks have second hands that sweep continuously, but many analog clocks (such as wristwatches) tick: the second hand moves in discrete steps. Does ticking (i.e. moving in discrete steps) mean an analog watch isn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; analog anymore? Of course not! An analog representation can be continuous &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; discrete, as long as the right kind of physical covariation is in place. When you start looking for them, you can see many more examples, too. Hourglasses, for example, are analog representations of how much time has passed, whether they contain a liquid, really small particles that you just take to be continuous, or big, discrete things like marbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this is all just a matter of thinking about the concept of “analog,” and looking at some examples of analog representation. But it also turns out that this is how to understand analog computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog (vs. Digital) Computation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t familiar with analog computation, you’re not alone. It was once the dominant computing paradigm, but digital computers have almost completely replaced analog computers. With advances in engineering, digital computers eventually became faster, more flexible, and cheaper than their analog counterparts. Nevertheless, they’re fascinating, and not just as a historical curiosity. They also exemplify a completely different kind of computation that — although not practical from an engineering perspective — shows another way that brains might compute. So let’s take a brief look at how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/949/1*qFmpB6hmsyw1ozo6hOH7kA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.analogmuseum.org/library/telefunken_ra770_kurzbeschreibung.pdf&quot;&gt;Engineer operating the Telefunken 770 RA analog computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key idea of analog computers is that they represent variables by the actual voltage level of a circuit element. So if you have a variable with the value 72.3, the circuit element representing that variable would be at 72.3 volts. This is completely different than how such a value would be stored in a digital computer: in that case, 72.3 would be represented by a series of 1s and 0s in some register (or, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754&quot;&gt;IEEE 754 standard for floating-point numbers,&lt;/a&gt; 01000010100100001001100110011010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add two variables in an analog computer, you use a circuit that literally adds the voltages: a circuit element would take two inputs, one that has &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; volts, one that has &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; volts, and produce an output that has (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) volts. But in a digital computer, to add two variables you use circuitry that adds the two numbers digit-by-digit, much the way that we all learned how to add numbers in elementary school. The least significant digits are added first, then the next most significant (plus a carry digit from the previous addition, if needed), and so on, until we reach the end of the digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the variables in analog computers are continuous, but there are exceptions, and those exceptions are important. Often, when using an analog computer, it helps to know how to program it using a mathematical characterization of whatever you’re interested in. But there are times when you might not know how to characterize something mathematically: you just know what it looks like. So instead of using a continuous function like a sine wave or polynomial, analog computers could approximate complex curves with a series of straight line segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*PK-qIF4ZrFQoGoCZyKi76Q.png&quot; /&gt;A continuous function (gray) approximated by a series of line segments (black).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other times, they would use step functions, with gaps between one value and another, where the voltage would literally switch between the values. Did the existence of these discontinuities mean that these computers weren’t really analog? Not at all: just like analog clocks that tick, analog computers with “steps” are still analog. And again, the reason is that there is analogy between &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they represent and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they represent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is worth belaboring a bit, especially in contrast with digital representation. Somewhat paradoxically, digital representation is both much more complicated but also much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take two digital representations of two different numbers. To keep things simple, we’ll use base-10, which we’re all familiar with, instead of the binary, or base-2 representation used in digital computers. The point is the same in either case. Compare how we represent the number three hundred forty seven and the number seven hundred twelve. Digitally, we represent the first number as 347, and the second as 712. What do those strings of numerals mean? Again, we are so familiar with this that we rarely stop to think about it, but we interpret them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;347&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 10²)+(4 ×10¹)+(7 × 10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 100)+(4 ×10)+(7 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 300 + 40 + 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;712&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 10²)+(1 ×10¹)+(2 ×10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 100)+(1 ×10)+(2 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 700 + 10 + 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important thing to note is that when we compare the two &lt;em&gt;representations&lt;/em&gt;, neither one is larger than the other. Of course, seven hundred twelve is a larger number than three hundred forty seven. But the three character string “712” is not itself larger than the three character string “347” (as long as we hold the font fixed!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are different when it comes to analog representations. If we represent these two numbers in an analog computer, for example, one voltage (712 volts) is literally larger than the other (347 volts). Or in the case of the analog thermometer, the height of the liquid representing 80 degrees is literally taller than the height representing 60 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, all of this still holds whether or not voltages and heights can only come in discrete pieces; analog representation just doesn’t have anything to do with continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing, let me mention another point about what digital does not mean. Some people take “digital” to be synonymous with “discrete,” but the two are different. Digital representations are, well, representations of digits, just like the example we just went through. “Discrete,” however, is much more general, and just means that the thing in question has separate parts. For many purposes, it may not be important that we’re careful about the distinction, but when we’re talking about computation, either in the brain or elsewhere, it is very important. Why? Simply because digital computers use the fact that numbers are represented digitally in order to function as they do. They are not called digital computers simply because they use discrete elements, or operate in discrete steps, but because they represent numbers (including variables, memory addresses, instructions, and so on) in base-2, digital format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, different kinds of tasks are better served by different kinds of computers using different kinds of representations. As it happened, digital computers got fast enough and cheap enough that they were preferred over their analog counterparts, although that wasn’t always true. But let’s look at just one simplified example to show the difference between a digital and an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*nIjx6j6bH5I1K3YiRespUw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I give you one thousand numbers that are represented digitally. More specifically, suppose I give you a thousand index cards, each one of which has a single number written on it. Your task is to find the largest number in that stack of a thousand. The fastest way to do this is also the simplest: you take the first card, call it the largest-so-far, then compare it with the next card. If that card is larger, you have a new largest-so-far; if not, you don’t. You keep comparing, and after 1,000 steps, you will have found the largest card in the pile. In general, how many steps does it take? It takes as many steps as cards you have. In computational complexity theory, we would say that this task has linear time complexity: start with 2,000 cards, it will take you twice as long; 3,000 cards, three times as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*rgaC7co6_DDq3s2iPSyXgw.png&quot; /&gt;Spaghetti noodles. © Can Stock Photo / AlfaStudio&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that instead of giving you a thousand numbers represented digitally, I gave you a thousand analog representations of numbers. In particular, suppose that I give you a bundle of one thousand spaghetti noodles, where the length of each noodle (in, say, millimeters) is the number being represented. Your task (again) is to find the largest number in those thousand. The fastest way to do this (again) is also the simplest: you take the bundle of noodles, tap one end on a flat surface, like a table, and place your hand down so that it hits the tallest one. After a single step, you will have found the largest noodle in the bundle, which represents the largest number of the thousand. In general, this only takes &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; step, which is constant time complexity (much better than linear!). No matter how many numbers (or, rather, representations of numbers) you start with, it’s always just one step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates one way that analog representation can be more efficient, but it also illustrates one of its limitations. Say we had many numbers that were very close in value to one another; it may be difficult to pick out the tallest one if they only differ by fractions of a millimeter. Represented digitally, however, we can easily tell whether two numbers are different. When it comes to contemporary digital computers, where individual steps can be taken at the rate of billions per second, this increased precision outweighs the larger number of steps needed (this, among others reasons, is why analog computers have fallen out of favor for general use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Computation in General…&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I hope to have made clear what analog representation is, and given at least a flavor of how analog computation works. Next, I need to say more about analog computation in general. Luckily for us though, understanding analog &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; is the hard part. All we need to add to the story to get analog computation is a mechanism that manipulates analog representations. But not just any old mechanism will do, nor will just any old manipulation. We need to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*ubrnz-_kfI0aFwLrRKEzyg.png&quot; /&gt;Schematic diagram of a mechanism: organized entities and their activities (bottom) are responsible for a phenomenon of interest (top).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophers of science have developed an account of mechanisms that makes precise what scientists, especially neuroscientists, implicitly mean when they talk about mechanisms (a book-length account is given in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.wustl.edu/cfcraver&quot;&gt;Carl Craver&lt;/a&gt;’s book Explaining the Brain). We don’t need to get into the details, but the general idea is straightforward: a mechanism is a set of entities and activities, organized in a particular way, that give rise to a phenomenon of interest. For much of neuroscience, what it means to explain some phenomenon is to discover and describe the mechanism responsible for that phenomenon. This is in contrast to, say, physics, where explanation involves describing a universal law of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we have a mechanism that manipulates analog representations, do we have an analog computer? Not quite. The manipulation has to be of the right kind. For example, I could build a device that rotates an analog thermometer (like the thermometer mentioned above). That’s certainly a kind of manipulation, and the device that does the rotating may well be a mechanism. But it’s not the right kind of manipulation. So what is the right kind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the mechanism has to manipulate the part of the analog representation that is doing the representing. So when we want to represent a temperature, we have to manipulate the &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt; of the liquid in the thermometer, not its angle. This, by the way, is precisely how thermostats work: one part of the device represents the actual temperature, another part of the device represents the desired temperature. And for analog thermostats, this is done with analog representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to see what this has to do with brains, let me point out that a nice thing about the story I just told is that it generalizes pretty well to digital computers, too. Just replace “analog” in what I said above with “digital:” a digital computer is a mechanism that manipulates digital representations, and it also has to manipulate them in the right way. Heating up the circuitry on your laptop is definitely a way to manipulate the digital representations inside, but not in a way that constitutes computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;…And in the Brain&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that we know what analog computation is, what does this have to do with brains? Quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a general point. Couching computation in terms of representation helps us distinguish what’s computational about the brain, and what isn’t. Brains, like all organs, do all kinds of things that aren’t directly relevant to their primary function, but simply help keep them alive. So for example, we once thought that glial cells only held neurons together and didn’t contribute anything interesting to neural signaling (hence their name, derived from the Greek word for glue). We now know that at least one type of glial cell, the astrocytes, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; contribute to signaling between neurons; another type, the ependymal cells, do not. That means that astrocytes — but not ependymal cells — contribute to computation in the brain. Neural signals are representations (or parts of representations), and the manipulation of those representations (by the right kind of mechanism) is computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s talk more specifically about what the &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; part of this story about computation has to do with brains. There is a whole lot of neural activity that counts as analog representation; you just have to remember that analog representation is about covariation (as discussed above), and not necessarily about continuity. So let’s look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/ratecoding&quot;&gt;consider rate coding&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most well-studied ideas of neural representation, and also one of the earliest. The basic idea of rate coding is simply that as a stimulus intensity increases (or decreases), the firing rate of the relevant neuron increases (or decreases). In other words, the representation (firing rate) increases with the thing being represented (the stimulus). That is about as straightforward an example of an analog representation as one could want. Whether it then counts as analog computation depends on whether the system in question manipulates that representation. For example, in their seminal 1926 work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1514868/&quot;&gt;Adrian and Zotterman&lt;/a&gt; found that as they increased the weight attached to muscle tissue, the sensory neurons of that muscle tissue increased their firing rate. The firing of those neurons serve as input to downstream neurons, and we have an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, rate coding has its limitations, but we can apply the model of analog computation to other neural coding schemes, too. For example, consider timing codes. Some timing codes in the auditory system, for example, work by comparing the relative time that different neural signals arrive at the same place. This allows the organism to locate where a sound came from. The larger the distance between the arrival of two signals, the larger the angle of the sound’s location from the center. Once again, an analog representation, used by the system, resulting in an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complicated example is how grid cells work. These are groups of neurons that create a two-dimensional map of a two-dimensional environment. So, for example, as the organism moves right, the activity of the grid cells “moves” right; as the organism moves left, the activity “moves” left. (More precisely, neurons representing locations to the left of the current position will fire as the organism moves left, vice versa for the right.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/375/1*2YtgtjV9pZMS_jE2wif0oA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Grid cells firing in response to an organism’s movement.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a two-dimensional analog representation, rather than the one-dimensional examples from above. Instead of changing just up or down, increasing or decreasing, we have change along two spatial dimensions. And the change in what’s represented (the environment) results in a corresponding change in the representation (the grid cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, higher-level, example is mental rotation in humans, which relies on the manipulation of analog representation (which, if you buy the view I propose here, just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; analog computation). Here is the task used in the relevant studies, originally devised by Shepard and Metzler in 1971. A participant is shown two pictures of 3-D objects, and asked to push one button (“same”) if the one on the right is a rotated version of the one on the left, and a different button (“different”) if the one on the right is a different object. An example is in the figure below: the top two figures are “same,” but the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*CCOh0tEHauufqba2nLkmoQ.png&quot; /&gt;Mental rotation stimuli. Top two objects are “same,” while the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when you record the time it takes for people to make a response (we only care about the “same” ones), you find that the more the objects are rotated, the longer it takes people to make that response. It’s as if people are mentally “rotating” the object in their head, and checking to see if the objects match. So, the more the objects are rotated, the more mental rotation they have to do, which translates into a longer response time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding has been replicated in numerous studies; in recent decades, cognitive neuroscientists have produced fMRI data from people performing the task while having their brain scanned. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17919082&quot;&gt;meta-analysis from 2008&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/&quot;&gt;Jeff Zacks&lt;/a&gt; found that dozens of these studies support the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations, supporting the original hypothesis proposed by Shepard and Metzler. Why should we think this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important point is that there are much more efficient ways to rotate the representation of an object. Using a typical digital representation, such as what is used in computer graphics systems, involves linear algebra. Without going into the details, the idea is that we can — in one step — multiply the 3-D coordinates of an object by a matrix, resulting in the object being rotated. Importantly, the amount of time it takes to rotate an object by two degrees is the same amount of time it takes to rotate an object by 180 degrees. However, that is simply not the result we find when humans perform this task. Instead, longer rotations take more time. That suggests that we are not rotating the object in a single step, but manipulating an analog representation that covaries with what it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analogy helps. Think about adding a couple of two-digit numbers the way you learned in elementary school. To keep things simple, we’ll use numbers that don’t require any carry digits. So if we want to add 11 to 12, we put one on top of the other, and add the digits. Same thing if we want to add 66 and 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/450/1*sF6FWsVFG-05n1AtUCy0Og.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, it takes the same number of steps, even though in the left problem, we’re starting and ending with much smaller numbers. This is just a fact about doing the addition digitally: even though the numbers are bigger, we’re just manipulating digits, and we’ve got the same number of digits in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s say we had to do the addition in a way that you learned when you were even younger, using (although you didn’t know it at the time) analog representations. Suppose we had a big bag of marbles, and we did the problem on the left by taking out 11 marbles, one at a time, then adding 12 marbles to those, one at a time, and then counting how many marbles we end up with. That would obviously take much less time than doing the problem on the right the same way. Now granted, this is not an efficient way of doing addition! But it does illustrate how analog — but not digital — representations take longer time to do some computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, some might think that this is all well and good, but at the very lowest levels, neural spikes are like the bits of digital computers; so maybe this analog stuff doesn’t have much to do with the hardware of the brain. Neural spikes are either on or off, just like the 1s and 0s of digital computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann&quot;&gt;John von Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the digital computer and a prolific polymath, put the view like this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181111/computer-and-brain&quot;&gt;his 1958 lecture&lt;/a&gt;: “The nervous pulses can clearly be viewed as (two-valued) markers: the absence of a pulse then represents one value (say, the binary digit 0), and the presence of one represents the other (say, the binary digit 1). This is clearly the description of the functioning of an organ in a digital machine. It therefore justifies the original assertion, that the nervous system has a prima facie digital character.” So maybe there are some analog things happening at higher levels, but at its root, neural spikes are discrete and digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some new evidence suggests that this might not be the whole story. An intriguing set of examples from scientists including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394682&quot;&gt;Bialowas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461842&quot;&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228266&quot;&gt;Rowan&lt;/a&gt;, and several others shows that there may be more to action potentials than previously thought. So first, let’s review a bit about action potentials, then see what these new results suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional view of the action potential is that it is a lot like the binary pulse of a digital computer. If we look close at the 1s and 0s of a digital computer, we’ll see that they are actually continuously-changing voltages. However, that continuous change stays around either (for example) zero volts or five volts, and the minor fluctuations above and below those two levels don’t matter for digital systems. That’s because we have designed them that way: even though there is continuous fluctuation, we can treat those voltages as if they are really at two discrete levels, which we call 0 and 1. The slight difference in the waveform from one bit to another doesn’t matter: all that matters is that there is some voltage that’s pretty close to 5 volts or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*XTIKoPJdiGAqiXF45gWiww.png&quot; /&gt;The digital computer and the neuron. Top: actual transistor voltage is “translated” as a 1. Bottom: actual neuron voltage is “translated” as a 1.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how neuroscientists have traditionally viewed the action potential, too. If we compare two different action potentials, there might be a slight difference in the waveform, but that doesn’t matter for the system. All that matters is whether there’s an action potential or not. Now, to be sure, there are exceptions: some neurons don’t generate spikes at all, but have a signal that varies continuously — neurons connected by gap junctions are an important example. And for other neurons, it’s not really the single spike that matters, but their rate of firing, as mentioned above. But these new findings are different altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having no significance, the scientists mentioned above have shown that the precise shape of the neural spike does have consequences. What does that mean? Basically, if a neural spike is a bit taller (it has a higher voltage), then it has a measurable effect on what happens to the neurons it’s connected to. Or, if the spike is a bit wider (it takes a little bit longer), then it also has a measurable effect on downstream neurons. These effects are small, but they are measurable, and completely different than what we find in digital computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So do these count as analog representations? Well, we don’t know yet. They are candidates, because we have something (a neural spike) that varies in the right way. But we do not yet know if these are representations at all. As mentioned before, neurons can do a lot of things, not all of which contribute to their representational capacities. If it turns out that the height (or width) of the neural spike increases as some other variable increases, it may well be a representation. We will have to see. For now though, it is an interesting candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me mention one aspect of analog computation that really has no counterpart in digital computation, which is also, admittedly, the most speculative on my part. Imagine you have a small computer program, or perhaps even a spreadsheet, where you have some variable called, say, “GrandTotal.” It’s easy enough to program a computer (or create a spreadsheet) that adds a whole bunch of numbers together, and stores that result in GrandTotal. And somewhere, deep in the electronic bowels of your computer’s process, there are some circuits called registers, and there’s a single register that physically stores the value of GrantTotal. Your computer is doing a lot of other things, so there are a lot of other values stored in nearby registers, too. Suppose, in fact, that, just for fun, you wanted to add the values of the eight nearest neighbors — the other registers nearest to GrandTotal — and store those in GrandTotal, too. How can you do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t. The way digital machines are designed and built, their physical implementation is completely abstracted from their programming. There is no way to access variables that are literally, physically closest to the one you are working with. Of course, if you are very familiar with a particular computer, you might be able to discover which of those registers are closest. But then they will be completely different in another machine. There is simply no way to put this kind of capability into the general programming of a digital computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, however, neurons do things like this all the time. Some neural signals, such as neuromodulators, are often simply broadcast to whatever neurons happen to be nearby. This capability takes advantage of the fact that neurons are physical devices, located in space relative to one another. And although digital computation can’t provide this kind of capability, certain kinds of analog computation can. This is simply because &lt;em&gt;analog computation embraces the physical nature of its representations, whereas digital computation abstracts away from it&lt;/em&gt;. Now to be sure, digital computation has many advantages: it is quite nice to be able to use the same program on a wide variety of different computers from different manufacturers, with different speeds, different amounts of memory, and so on. But there is more to computation than just the digital, which, if I’ve done my job, you’ll believe now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analog computers have fallen out of favor, and as a consequence, we don’t think about them when we think about computation. And while the advantages of digital computation are clear for practical purposes, analog computation turns out to be an excellent way to think of computation more generally. When we look closely at how digital computation really works, it has almost nothing in common with how brains work. If digital computation is the only concept of computation you have, you might think we should abandon the idea that brains literally compute. But that would be much too hasty: we just need a broader notion of computation, and it turns out that looking to analog computation helps us see how brains could be computers after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;Every child is born into a world far more complex than the womb it departed. Physically it’s made up of objects, distances, heights, which we know new-born infants are already oriented to read and make sense of. But their new world is also a social one, chock-full of agents with needs and intentions, and past findings show that infants are surprisingly quick to recognise much of this too.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;New research &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds to this literature, investigating the ability to make an important social distinction – between those who hold power due to respect and those who impose it through force – and finds that already by the time they are toddlers, infants can do this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35161&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past evidence showed that infants in the first year of life can view situations and recognise who is likely to hold power. They are more surprised (we know this because they pay attention for longer) when a smaller figure bosses a bigger one about, or a lone figure controls someone with companions, than when the opposite is true. Infants also seem to grasp that power lasts over time, looking longer when someone who used to be obeyed is suddenly defied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Francesco Margoni of the University of Trento, wanted to see if this sensitivity to power extended to telling between its two major types –  legitimate power (e.g. when someone is chosen to be leader or has natural talents) and power based on bullying and inciting fear. We know that these types of power have different implications: fear-based power is resented and can lead to acts of disobedience when possible. Do infants have a sense of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Margoni’s team recruited 96 healthy infants – average age 20-24 months; a balance of sexes – and presented them with a series of cartoony videos (see examples below). One set began with three figures playing with a ball who are visited by a leader wearing a flamboyant hat and wielding a stick that it used to strike the floor, triggering a greeting ritual involving the ball-players&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bowing and murmuring reverently (intended to show this leader was respected).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the leader told the other characters it was time for bed, led them into a house, and left. At this point the study forked, and the infants either saw the subordinates closing their eyes, thus obeying the leader, or they watched a different clip where the ball-playing characters exited the house back to their game area. These two 15-second climaxes looped until the infant lost interest. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the infants looked significantly longer at the version of the story involving disobedience, suggesting that already at this age, the infants did not expect a respected leader to be disobeyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other infants viewed a similar series of videos with a crucial difference: the cue for where the visiting leader was drawing their power. Instead of using their stick for a greeting ritual, this bully visitor used it to strike each of the other characters on the head. Margoni’s team were interested in what the infants would make of disobedience towards this kind of bullying leader. In fact the infants’ looking times were similar whether the subordinate characters did as they were told or disobeyed, suggesting they did not find disobeying a bully at all surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow-up experiments showed the main findings were unaffected by whether or not the leader wore a giant hat (implying that the size of the leader figure wasn’t the determining factor). Nor were the effects due to the bully being seen as ineffectual: when another video showed the bully staying in the room, infants now found disobedience surprising. Even though the bully was outnumbered, the infants still expected what the bully said to be law… at least for those within reach of the stick.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last possibility was that the infants expected compliance to the leader figure because they seemed nice, not because they seemed powerful. So the researchers introduced a visitor who was friendly but had no obvious power. Now the infants were more surprised when the ball-playing characters &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; obey, quite the opposite effect to that found with the respected leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that we understand power relations at a surprisingly young age. The infant mind can read legitimate power and distinguish it from tyranny, understanding not merely who is in charge, but why. Even toddlers recognise that the iron fist holds the most tenuous grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;Infants distinguish between leaders and bullies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to know why the electro-diffusion equation is called the Nernst-Planck equation, I read the original papers by these authors a few years ago. This reading formed the basis of a little review paper of mine with the above title (published in Journal of Integrative Neuroscience 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review first discussed Nernst's and Planck's early papers on electro-diffusion, the brief priority conflict that followed, and the role these papers played in shaping the  emerging concept of membrane excitability. The second part of this review discussed in greater detail the constraints of the Nernst-Planck theory, and showed more recent examples of its applicability to neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various issues on which there is a scientific consensus but great public controversy, such as anthropogenic climate change and the safety of vaccines. One previously popular explanation for this mismatch was that an information deficit among the public is to blame. Give people all the facts and then, according to this perspective, the public will catch up with the scientists. Yet time and again, that simply hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2018.1521870&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Thinking and Reasoning&lt;/em&gt; explores the roots of this problem further. Emilio Lobato and Corinne Zimmerman asked 244 American university students and staff whether they agreed with the scientific consensus on climate change, vaccines, genetically modified (GMO) foods and evolution; to give their reasons; and to say what would convince them to change their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has already done a good job of identifying the individual characteristics – such as having an analytical thinking style and being non-religious – that tend to correlate with accepting the scientific consensus, but this is the first time that researchers have systematically studied people’s open-ended reasoning about controversial scientific topics. The results show that for many people, there are certain issues for which the truth is less about facts and more about faith and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35193&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman found that the most common justifications people gave for their positions on the controversial issues were to simply re-state or qualify their belief – what the researchers called a non-justification, which made up 34 per cent of all responses. Among the actual justifications, the most common kind, making up 33 per cent of all responses, was to cite evidence – a promising result. However, 20 per cent of justifications were subjective and involved making a reference to one’s cultural identity, personal experience or fallacious reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific kinds of subjective justification given tended to vary according to topic. For instance, sceptical attitudes toward the scientific consensus on genetically modified foods (as safe) tended to involve fallacious reasoning of a conspiratorial bent (such as “I am hesitant to believe there are NO concerns because the multinational agricultural corporations such as Monsanto have profits as the basis of their existence so any information they put out is suspect”), or they invoked the naturalistic fallacy (such as, “GMO foods are unnatural and therefore not safe for our bodies”). In contrast, subjective justifications for disbelieving evolutionary theory were more likely to make reference to the importance of one’s cultural or religious identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most significant finding, though, was people’s inconsistency in how they reasoned about the four different scientific topics. For example, while many participants did cite data and evidence to justify their stance on some occasions, only 27 participants (11 per cent) did this consistently across all the topics. “It seems that people are consistently inconsistent in how they reason about scientific topics,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a similar story when it came to the kind of reasons that participants cited that would cause them to change their minds. While it was promising that new evidence or data was mentioned more often than any other reasons, still 45 per cent of participants explicitly denied, at least once, that anything could change their mind on a particular topic; 17 per cent said this of more than one topic. And while 80 per cent of participants indicated that new evidence or data would change their mind on a particular topic, not a single participant took this position on all four controversial topics. Again, the main message is people’s inconsistency in how they reason about different scientific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming prior research on individual characteristics that correlate with scientific reasoning, participants with more of an analytical reasoning style (as measured by agreement with questionnaire items like “I enjoy problems that require hard thinking”) and a stronger liberal political orientation, were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus on the four topics, and to make reference to evidence when reasoning about their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman cautioned that it remains to be seen whether their findings would generalise to scientific topics that have not (yet) been politicised. Of course the current results are also based on a narrow US sample and may be different elsewhere. Notwithstanding these limitations, the researchers said their findings could have implications for scientific advocates: they suggest it may be beneficial to discuss and present topics in a way that reduces any association with your audience’s socio-political identity; and they highlight the importance of better training and education in an analytical thinking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to tailor education about science to the manner in which people think about science may improve scientific literacy,” the researchers concluded, “but doing so requires more research into why people hold the beliefs they do about science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation can be defined as “the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body.” A growing area of research in the field of neuromodulation has been centered around its potential effects on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Successful neuromodulation of the motor cortex could promise life-changing implications for those affected by movement disorders brought on by stroke and diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising neuromodulation technique shown to affect the motor cortex is pulse transcranial ultrasound stimulation (pTUS). This method uses pulsed low-frequency ultrasound to harmlessly penetrate deep into brain tissue and can be targeted specifically towards brain waves which affect muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers published a study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which looked at the effect pTUS had on the cortico-muscular coupling (mind-muscle connection) between the motor cortex and tail muscles in mouse subjects. Researchers, Xie &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; tested different tone bursts and evaluated the effect they had on the muscle activity of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xie and colleagues found that significant differences in the cortico-muscular coupling activity of mice resulted from an increasing number of tone-bursts, from 150 – 300, at 1kHZ. The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pediatric medical patients are often not as resilient to the pain associated with common invasive medical procedures, such as venipuncture, when compared to their adult counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Shave &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, published this study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they took a qualitative, interview-based approach at assessing child caregivers’ understanding and perspective towards pain associated with pediatric medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10642&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10642&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/paed-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey saw that caregivers were generally satisfied with the pain management practices that healthcare providers afforded their pediatric patients. However, study participants showed further emphasis toward the value of providing extra information to caregivers and pediatric patients, regarding the purpose of the procedures, as well as what to expect in terms of pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Lastly, participating caregivers further suggested that healthcare providers should direct extra effort towards addressing the child specifically, informing them of the sensations and outcomes of the procedure in terms they can understand; as well as allowing the pediatric patients to ask questions and make decisions regarding the procedure whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10643&quot; style=&quot;width: 251px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10643 &quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/engineer-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;241&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the BMC Series announced that it would be expanding its journal portfolio beyond the realm of biology and medicine, and into the physical sciences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmecheng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is the fourth and latest of these journals to be open for submission. The journal’s scope ranges from articles on “fluid dynamics” to “mechatronics and automation” and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandros Houssein, Ph.D., Editor for &lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2018/10/26/bmc-mechanical-engineering-now-open-submissions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; announcing the journal’s launch and detailing the importance of the new open access platform now available to the mechanical engineering research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Houssein speaks on behalf of the journal’s ethos by stating, “&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; embraces this diversity of subjects and comes to support a large and international research community. With a focus on championing open access research, it aims to advance scientific discovery by making research freely accessible across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storage of digital information in DNA has recently gained a lot of attention due to its promise of high-volume, and extremely long-term, storage potential. While DNA digital data storage is currently possible and being utilized, improvements to methodologies are necessary to realize the full potential of this fascinating and efficient storage model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Akhmetov &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, have recently published an article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they detail their development of a novel DNA digital data storage method. Their “parallelized” storage method aims to capitalize on the weaknesses of previously established methodologies, allowing for better long-term storage, built-in error detection, increased efficiency, and a redundant reading process that allows for the collection of data even if the DNA is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of better DNA digital storage methodologies will be fascinating developments to witness as we make it feasible to store immense datasets for longer terms than previously thought possible, all using the building blocks of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aiche.org/chenected/2018/10/sang-yup-lee-on-importance-publishing-scientific-journals-interview&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIChE Annual Meeting 2018: An interview with the chair of BMC Chemical Engineering on the importance of publishing, and benefits of open access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just prior to the 2018 annual meeting for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the chair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Sang Yup Lee, participated in an interview where the importance of scientific publishing was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee began by discussing how, over the years, the field of Chemical Engineering has been constantly adapting its principles and practices to remain useful, and in some cases essential, to various scientific disciplines. Dr. Lee even asserted, “Chemical engineering has been, is and will be at the core of all industries, including energy, chemicals, materials, medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this information being generated by chemical engineers across such a wide field of disciplines, Dr. Lee went on to emphasize the importance of publication and the open access model: “Publishing in scientific journals is one of the most important media for the dissemination of research outputs. Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5995-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating the growing trend of non-drinking among young people; analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys in England 2005–2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England’s youth have been experiencing an increasing trend in alcohol abstention, which has been wholly celebrated from a public health standpoint. Among citizens aged 16 to 24, the rate of self-reported “non-drinkers” has risen from 18% in 2005 to 29% in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10645&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10645&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/non-drinking-300x300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed to look at the ways in which non-drinking behavior has been increasing among the young adult population in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study evaluated whether specific subgroups have been experiencing a disproportionate increase in non-drinking, as well as whether rates of problematic drinking behaviors, such as binge drinking, are changing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers Fat &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, utilized a qualitative, survey-based approach, where trained interviewers administered a face-to-face interview inside participants’ homes. The study revealed that rates of non-drinking are on the rise across most of its practices, the only exception being that of ex-drinkers, which saw neither an increase or decrease in prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study also showed that, overall, non-drinking behavior is increasing across many subgroups, including subgroups that are already associated with non-drinking behavior. Young adults are also engaging in problematic drinking behaviors less, as rates of overdrinking and binge drinking are lower than previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found no significant association between non-drinking and any one single factor in particular, suggesting that the change may be “multi-factorial or cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12904-018-0368-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Access to palliative care for homeless people: complex lives, complex care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless individuals lack many things considered essential, appropriate health care should not be one of them. In the year 2000, the United Nations stated: “Health is a fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights. Every human being is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity.” Despite this policy, it has been shown that the homeless population is still not afforded an appropriate level of care, especially for end of life palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10654&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10654 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/homeless-2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors of an article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detail their findings from their study on the quality of palliative care provided to the homeless population in the Netherlands. De Veer &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; conducted quality in-depth interviews with over 50 participants, including homeless individuals, nurses, case workers, and physicians. The interviews were used to reconstruct the cases of 19 homeless individuals who are or have previously experienced palliative care, 11 of which had already passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the non-homeless population, homeless individuals were found to experience several key themes that prevented them from experiencing adequate palliative care, namely: late access to palliative care, capricious health care trajectories, and a high degree of complexity associated with care.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open and Shut?: Plan S and Researchers’ Rights: (Re)Framing Academic Freedom</title>
	<link>https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/plan-s-and-researchers-rights-reframing.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;When in 1915 the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was formed, and published its &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/A6520A9D-0A9A-47B3-B550-C006B5B224E7/0/1915Declaration.pdf&quot;&gt;Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it was responding to a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_University_Professors#History&quot;&gt;specific historical situation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today the historical situation researchers find themselves in is different and academic freedom faces &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ceupress.com/book/academic-freedom&quot;&gt;new challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. What complicates the picture is that there is considerable disagreement over what exactly academic freedom is, and what aspects of academic life it covers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;This lack of consensus has become all too apparent in the current discussions about Plan S. Indeed, some of those who support Plan S maintain that academic freedom is no longer relevant, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonHoyt/status/1059784394116947968&quot;&gt;or has ceased to exist in any meaningful way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot;&gt;key principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Plan S – which a growing number of funders are signing up to – is that “After 1 January 2020 scientific publications on the results from research funded by public grants provided by national and European research councils and funding bodies, must be published in compliant Open Access Journals or on compliant Open Access Platforms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most (if not all) researchers would surely agree that this is a laudable goal. But for some (we don’t know how many) the way in which it is currently envisaged that Plan S will be implemented raises a red flag with regard to academic freedom. It does not help that those who devised the initiative dismiss these concerns out of hand. The main architect of Plan S –  Robert-Jan Smits – &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06936-7&quot;&gt;has even bemoaned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the fact that people are citing academic freedom in the context of Plan S, “because it stifles a lot of debate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, it is clear that some researchers believe Plan S does have implications for academic freedom. And a growing number of them (currently approaching 1,000) are signing &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/open-letter&quot;&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that asserts, amongst other things, that Plan S “is a serious violation of academic freedom”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the apparent disenchantment with Plan S amongst at least some in the research community, and given that researchers find themselves increasingly subjected to ever more demanding OA policies like it (in which new duties, new restrictions and limitations, and new responsibilities are imposed on them), it is surely time to look again at what academic freedom does and does not mean, and what it should and should not mean in today’s context, and try to redefine and/or refine it for today’s historical situation; or at least to, as Marc Couture puts it in his guest post below, seek to “reframe” it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What seems clear to me is that there is a pressing need for a debate about the relevance, role and responsibilities of academic freedom in the context of the growing list of open access policies, with a view to arriving at some kind of consensus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What also seems clear to me is that this discussion ought to take place amongst researchers before funders seek to impose radical initiatives like Plan S on them. After all, if academic freedom means anything, it surely means that it is researchers and their institutions who should be in the driving seat over this, not funders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;But why not read what Marc Couture has to say below and think about the questions he asks before reaching your own conclusion on these matters. It may well be that Marc’s views on whether and how Plan S has implications for academic freedom are different to mine. But I am not a member of the research community, so my views are not what counts here. What I think &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; count is what the majority of researchers think.

I’m pleased to observe that these don’t concern the relevance of open access, whose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://works.bepress.com/jean_gabriel_bankier/27/&quot;&gt;wide-ranging benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; now seem to be almost universally acknowledged, but only potentially negative side-effects of the massive, if not global, shift to open access that the plan hopes to bring about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though many aspects of the plan are somewhat unclear, and most details of its implementation are still being drafted, what we do know already raises various worries. One is a possible conflict with academic freedom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two requirements of the plan are specifically targeted: (1) publication only in compliant journals (full OA, no hybrid) and (2) dissemination under a licence compliant with the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration&quot;&gt;Berlin OA definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which would require authors to accept ceding generous usage rights in their works to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must say first that I firmly believe that academic freedom is important; it is at the very heart of higher education. Drawing from the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyacademicfreedom.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;numerous available definitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I would formulate its basic, most general definition as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 35.4pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n11&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 35.4pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Academic freedom (AF) is the right, for individual academics as well as their institutions, to decide by themselves the subjects and ideas they wish to investigate, disseminate or teach upon without fear of reprisal or censorship, with the ultimate purpose of benefitting both scholarship and the common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n11&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some definitions of AF include further rights, for instance the right – individually or as a community – to decide not only what is investigated, disseminated or taught, but how it is done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others add more specific freedoms, the most relevant in relation to Plan S being the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001132/113234mb.pdf&quot;&gt;freedom to choose the publication venue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for one’s research results. One also remarks that the language used in some definitions can be very strong, qualifying such freedoms as “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure&quot;&gt;full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdenver.edu/policy/Pages/Academic-Freedom.aspx&quot;&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” or “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmu.edu/resources/facstaff/senate/EXC_MINUTES_8-17-18.pdf&quot;&gt;without constraints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;A &lt;i&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It must be pointed out that AF is neither an absolute, divine-like right, nor a “blank check” granted to researchers. It’s rather a privilege, bestowed to academia by society. Moreover, a &lt;i&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/i&gt; is at work here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the one hand, society acknowledges that scholarship is the most powerful and trustworthy way to explain the world and solve its problems, as long as it is protected from ideological, political and economic vested interests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other hand, scholars, both individually and collectively, must act in a responsible way, by living up to the values underpinning scholarship (rationality, critical thinking, honesty and respect in debates) and the common good (equity, inclusivity, human dignity).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far, the discussions on actual or potential conflicts between Plan S and AF have involved specific freedoms found in one or another definition, with participants arguing that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(1) This or that requirement of Plan S does (or doesn’t) concern, or conflict with, AF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2) This or that measure proposed in Plan S may concern or conflict with AF, but other things as problematic, if not more, have been going on for years in academia without anybody complaining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(3) (Generally, in response to #1 or #2) this or that definition of AF is unclear, outdated or irrelevant, and must be dismissed, or interpreted in this or that way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;My stance is that while more freedom is &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; preferable in the academy, the exercise of rights included in AF, especially the more specific ones found in its various definitions, may or may not contribute, in a given situation or context, to AF’s ultimate purpose of benefitting scholarship and/or the common good. In fact, it could even do the exact opposite, or entail both benefits and harms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, when a measure or a policy seems to conflict with those rights, one should not simply brandish AF as a “trump card” as an argument to counter it, but see this conflict as a warning, inviting one to examine to what extent the exercise of AF, in the situation at hand, effectively benefits – or hinders – scholarship and the common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me illustrate this approach by looking at the two issues I mentioned in relation to Plan S where the topic of AF has been brought forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;(1) Constraints on publishing venues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S puts severe constraints on the venues where research results may be published. This will reduce the choices available to researchers. However, to what extent it will do so is currently hard to assess, as it depends on publishers’ response to Plan S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, any conflict with AF would be of utmost concern, since the right to disseminate one’s results is viewed as part of the basic definition of AF. One such conflict I could foresee in this context is if, when Plan S is finally implemented, researchers choosing marginal or unpopular, yet legitimate, topics or methods found they were unable to publish their results in peer-reviewed scholarly journals altogether, because not one, or too few of those complying with Plan S would consider, let alone accept, their papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, I haven’t seen any mention of such a dire scenario in the discussions about Plan S; considering the ever-increasing number of OA journals in all fields, this is understandable. Rather, the major complaint is that Plan S will impede researchers from publishing in very specific journals, meaning highly selective, high impact ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is viewed as conflicting with AF, on the grounds that definitions of AF either imply researchers must be the only ones to have a say in the way research is done (this may or may not include publication), or with reference to more specific freedoms, like “full freedom in publication” or the right to choose the publishing venue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is thus not surprising that critics have invoked specific rights associated to AF to oppose measures that could either (1) hurt leading, generally (for the time being) non-compliant journals or (2) impede researchers from publishing in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, researchers wouldn’t lose the possibility of disseminating their results. Most papers submitted to these highly selective journals are rejected not for being faulty, but because they are deemed unimportant, not original enough, or unfit for the venue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-017-9921-3&quot;&gt;most of them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are subsequently published in other journals, often journals that focus less on criteria like relevance and potential impact and more on the general quality of the paper and the soundness of reasoning and analysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What those researchers who succeed in having their papers published in prestigious journals really fear is losing the ability to benefit, career-wise, from the so-called “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fennia.journal.fi/article/view/70469/32624&quot;&gt;prestige economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, where journals are evaluated and ranked according to qualitative (perceived prestige) and, increasingly, quantitative criteria (rejection rates, impact factors), and where individual researchers are judged by their peers in large part on the number of papers and the journals in which the papers appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there are strong reasons to believe, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037&quot;&gt;mounting evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to that effect, that this prestige-based evaluation system, as deeply ingrained in academia as it may be, is deeply flawed on many accounts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, the “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;publishing oligopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” of large publishers has skillfully used it to increase its stranglehold on scholarly publication and to justify its skyrocketing costs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One can even argue that the current system conflicts with the freedom of choice in research included in AF’s basic definition. After all, giving prominence to the number of papers and restricting journals that really “count” towards evaluation to leading, high impact ones may in practice make researchers, if they hope to remain in academia, avoid research topics or methods that take too much time to produce results, or that won’t be considered by these highly selective journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here we face a peculiar situation where, in the very name of AF, the research community hesitates to let go of, or significantly reform, a system that is far from optimal and that, quite paradoxically, may well limit the AF of individual researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cOAlitionS_Preamble.pdf&quot;&gt;Preamble of Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; alludes to this prestige economy, by speaking of a “misdirected reward system” and by endorsing the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA Declaration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which proposes that researchers are judged upon the quality and impact of their research, both multi-faceted notions not reducible to numbers and journal names. And while its principles don’t refer explicitly to this system, Plan S has certainly the potential to disturb, or even disrupt it, again to an extent difficult to assess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, one has to put into balance two consequences of the drastic change Plan S hopes to achieve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the one side, there could be drawbacks for some researchers, though one can think that under a new evaluation paradigm, many if not most of them would still see their valuable work recognized. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The importance of high-impact journals, possibly imperilled by Plan S, for assessing the quality of scholarship has also been highlighted, although studies (like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418218112&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) draw a more nuanced picture of the efficiency of the gatekeeping they provide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other side, there are potential benefits to scholarship, in terms of efficiency (e.g., the overall burden of peer-review being reduced, publication delays shortened), and to society (e.g. fewer public funds diverted towards publishers’ revenues and profits, universal access to research results).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;(2) The requirement to publish with a liberal licence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S also requires that the main research results are disseminated under a licence with minimal restrictions (CC BY or similar). Since deciding the way in which one’s works are used may be part of “full freedom in publication”, this requirement may also be viewed as conflicting with AF. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, some researchers don’t like to see their works used by others to “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://schadtlab.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/a-rant-on-strawberries-open-access-licenses-and-the-reuse-of-published-papers/&quot;&gt;make money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”; many are also reluctant to let others adapt them, fearing that this may endanger both the quality of scholarship and the author’s own reputation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, we might wonder to what extent allowing researchers to decide how their works are used (this includes, ironically, letting publishers become the ones to decide) is beneficial to scholarship and society. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What contributes more to AF’s ultimate purpose: protecting works against uses researchers dislike or fear, or allowing those works to be easily used and adapted? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are numerous studies and discussions on this topic, covering issues like fear &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; actual risk, the fuzziness of the various usage restrictions, and their effects on potential users, that could feed the discussion (see for instance &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.107&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.150.2189&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openglam.org/files/2013/01/iRights_CC-NC_Guide_English.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, what I propose here is to reframe the role that academic freedom plays in discussions about the proposals put forth in Plan S, by assessing both their potential consequences on scholarship and the common good as well as the nature of their actual or potential conflict with AF, keeping in mind that the &lt;i&gt;raison d’être&lt;/i&gt; of AF is, after all, to benefit scholarship and the common good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this leaves much room for interpretation and discussion, notably how we define quality in scholarship and what constitutes the common good, I believe it would help answer questions like: Is Plan S a sound, or reasonable proposal? How can it be improved and implemented in order to reach its stated goal, that is flipping to OA a sizable part of scholarly communication, while bringing benefits to both scholarship and society? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are crucial issues, and I see a real danger that a strict, almost dogmatic stance on AF could cause Plan S to fall short of its potential to pave the way towards a less costly, yet &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fairopenaccess.org/&quot;&gt;more fair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, full-OA scholarly publication system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The author thanks Marie-Josée Legault and Richard Poynder for their helpful comments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teluq.ca/~mcouture/home.htm&quot;&gt;Marc Couture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; was until recently science professor at &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teluq.ca/site/en&quot;&gt;TELUQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, University of Quebec distance education arm.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schadenfreude – which literally means “harm-joy” in German –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is the sense of pleasure derived from others’ misfortune. It’s a “poorly understood” emotion, according to a group of psychologists at Emory University in the US, and in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X18301430&quot;&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;New Ideas in Psychology&lt;/i&gt; they propose a new “tripartite” model of schadenfreude based on the idea that deep-seated survival concerns can motivate us to see others as less than human.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35151&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shensheng Wang and his colleagues Scott Lilienfeld and Philippe Rochat draw on evidence from three decades of social, developmental, personality and clinical research into schadenfreude. They begin by identifying three distinguishable but related sub-forms of the emotion, “each underpinned by a distinct concern [either aggression, rivalry, or justice] that has deep developmental roots, unfolding in infant and child development”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggression-related schadenfreude derives from the sense of social identity that develops during infancy. Strengthening one’s own social group can entail aggression towards others, and “aggression schadenfreude” is the type experienced by supporters of one football team when another team (not necessarily one they are playing) loses a match, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rivalry schadenfreude” is related to some extent, but is rooted in personal competition – the desire to do better than your peers. Envy can have a part to play in this, and Wang’s team note that both schadenfreude and envy emerge around 7 years of age (in fact some work has found jealousy, and subsequent schadenfreude toward the target of that jealousy, even in two-year-olds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third sub-form of schadenfreude is “justice-based” and is rooted in perceived fairness, which also develops early in childhood. Delight in the misfortune of a high-profile individual who is successful, but who has cheated in business and is then exposed and humiliated, would fall into this category,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all vary in our tendency to feel schadenfreude, the researchers note. For instance, there’s evidence that people with low self-esteem are more likely to perceive other people’s success as a threat to their self-evaluations, and to be more likely to experience schadenfreude as a result.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who score relatively highly on measures of the “dark triad” of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, as well as on the trait of sadism, also tend to feel more schadenfreude. All of these personality traits have been linked to dehumanisation – perceiving another person or members of a group as lacking at least some of the attributes that make us all human, the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that when people experience Schadenfreude, they undergo a [temporary] process similar to that experienced by individuals with high levels of psychopathic personality traits: motivated by certain situational and to a lesser extent dispositional variables, the perceiver tends to dehumanise the victim, temporarily losing the motivation to detect the victim’s mind, much like a psychopath,” they write. In fact, they argue, the process of dehumanisation “may lie at the core of this emotion”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of Wang and his colleagues’ “motivational model” of schadenfreude is that concerns of self-evaluation, social identity and justice “push” individuals towards schadenfreude, whereas “mind perception” (an understanding of what other people are thinking and feeling) pulls them away from it. “We argue that this motivational model of Schadenfreude would help integrate its multiple facets and offer a heuristic framework for embedding Schadenfreude research within the context of emotion theories,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate over the moral nature of schadenfreude has a long history, going back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who condemned it as a malicious emotion. In their conclusion, Wang and his team write: “We encourage researchers to subject our theoretical model to rigorous tests so that they can be either falsified or corroborated, ideally with the aim of bringing this provisional model more closely in line with psychological reality… A deeper appreciation of Schadenfreude may provide a valuable window into the diverse origins of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/&quot;&gt;darker side of humanity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: Pregnancy sculpts women’s brains in preparation for motherhood</title>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/pregnancy-sculpts-womens-brains-in-preparation-for-motherhood/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5727 size-large&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pexels-photo-396133-1024x682.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motherhood changes everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know before I had my boys how completely and utterly being their mother would change EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having children threw the pieces of my life up in the air. The pieces settled again, but my body, outlook on life, sense of self and emotions have never been quite the same. Not only did I birth two beautiful boys into the world, I birthed a new identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I realise it is the ultimate cliché, but motherhood changes everything. It recalibrates our life course and realigns our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience is not unique. Motherhood is one of the most fundamental transformations we go through as women. And for many of us, parenthood brings with it powerful identity changes and conflicting emotions: love, protectiveness, joy, nurturing, exhaustion, confusion, anger and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cocktail of pregnancy hormones prepares your body and brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a cocktail of hormones prepares your body for birth and breastfeeding. You grow an entirely new organ, the placenta, to ensure your baby receives nutrients and to buffer her against stress. Your metabolism resets to store energy for foetal development and lactation. Your breasts grow so you can nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your baby arrives, she’s often so irresistible you become consumed by her and spend much of your time caressing, holding, feeding, gazing at her and breathing in her scent. These maternal behaviours, as they’re called, are essential for the survival of your newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same cocktail profoundly alters the architecture of your expectant brain, in particular, the brain structures underlying social cognition and emotion. These brain changes last, and in both humans and non-human mammals, the differences in the brains and behaviours of mothers and non-mothers are evident throughout the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a new way to think about pregnancy — changes to your &lt;em&gt;body &lt;/em&gt;ensure your baby is carried safely to term; and changes to your &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt; ensure you’re prepared for the social and emotional challenges of motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in women’s brains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/images/Hoekzema_NN2016.pdf&quot;&gt;A paper&lt;/a&gt; published December 2016 in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; gave us our first detailed insight into how pregnancy changes the structure of women’s brains. Using MRI, a team of Dutch and Spanish researchers lead by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/senior-investigator/190-research-fellows/233-elseline-hoekzema&quot;&gt;Elseline Hoekzema&lt;/a&gt; scanned the brains of twenty-five first-time mothers before and after pregnancy, and compared their brains to twenty women who’d never been pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was associated with pronounced and long-lasting changes in the structure of women’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, grey matter volume was lost. The loss wasn’t random, but was from the same cortical regions in every woman, specifically, regions of the cortex related to social cognition, empathy and theory of mind, which is the ability to read the desires and intentions of others from their faces and actions. The hippocampus, a region associated with memory, also lost volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain changes were long-lasting. Two years after the initial scan, eleven of women who hadn’t fallen pregnant for the second time were invited back and their brains scanned again. In all women, the grey matter shrinkage had endured, except for in the hippocampus, which had recovered volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is grey matter shrinkage a good thing for a new Mum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the plastic changes are not dissimilar to those seen in adolescence when pubertal hormones trigger thinning of the grey matter in teenager’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Synaptic pruning in adolescence is generally regarded as an essential process of fine-tuning connections into functional networks and is thought to represent a refinement and specialization of brain circuitry, which is critical for healthy cognitive, emotional and social development,” says Hoekzema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely a similar process of maturation and specialisation of the social brain is taking place during pregnancy. Loss of grey matter volume sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more, and reflects ‘functional streamlining’, not degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain changes are related to empathy and reading the emotions of others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the grey matter changes occurred in regions associated with theory of mind and empathy, Hoekzema and her team ran a series of additional tests, to see if changes were related to real-life skills. Interestingly, data revealed the greater the degree of grey matter plasticity, the greater the strength of the connection and bonding between a mother and her baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, MRI and fMRI research examining brain structure shows changes to be very subtle and many thousands of people must be scanned to detect small differences. In this case, the grey matter changes induced by pregnancy were anything but subtle. Notably, a computer program was able to automatically determine whether or not a woman had undergone pregnancy based only on her brain scans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what is it about pregnancy that sculpts women’s brains?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoekzema and colleagues propose it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unequaled surges of sex steroid hormones that a woman is exposed to during her pregnancy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endocrine climate of pregnancy may drive grey matter refinement via changes in the number of synapses, glia, dendritic structures, blood vessels or myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of becoming a parent for the first time is an intense, all-encompassing experience, so the obvious question to ask is, whether it is pregnancy, the act of caring for a child, or another factor such as sleep deprivation that tinkers with brain structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tested for the effects of parenting versus pregnancy in a rather ingenious way — they scanned the brains of first-time fathers before and after their wife’s pregnancies. They found no changes in the structure of the men’s brains after they took on dad-duties, which strongly suggested any changes in the women were related to the biological changes of pregnancy rather than the process of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Similar brain changes are seen in other mammals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female rodents can’t read books to find out what to expect when they’re expecting or how to tame toddlers. Therefore, changes in how new rodent mothers think, feel and behave must be driven entirely by biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioural neuroscientists who study the neurobiology of parenting, say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maternal brain is both the goal of the endocrine tsunami that accompanies pregnancy, and the culmination of millennia of natural selective processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of maternal behaviours and superior cognitive abilities has been neatly mapped on to the ‘maternal circuitry’ in the female rodent brain. Like human mothers, rat mother’s brains are structurally different thanks to the hormones of pregnancy and the enriching experience of caring for their young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does this data mean pregnancy is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for parenthood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note this study does not imply fathers nor non-birth mothers lack the ‘parenting brain circuitry’ or a ‘theory of mind’, and it certainly does not let them off the hook from parenting! We don’t need neuroscience to support or deny that fact, anyway. Babies need warm, secure attachment with at least one loving caregiver to organise and regulate healthy brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is one very influential biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that benefit the transition into motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A birth mother is not the only adult capable of being such a caregiver. This data simply shows pregnancy is a very influential bottom-up biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that may benefit the transition into motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In week 45:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; was pushed to the stable repositories. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/issue-labeling-scheme&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; does not build with
it yet, because &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/issue-labeling-scheme&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; tries to link with both &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; and its Python
bindings during the build. I've filed a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues/1063&quot;&gt;ticket upstream&lt;/a&gt;  to clarify if this
is correct. I have already &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/libneurosim/issues/12&quot;&gt;filed a PR&lt;/a&gt; that puts the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt;
Python bindings in the right location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-libNeuroML&quot;&gt;python-libNeuroML&lt;/a&gt; was pushed to the stable repositories and is now ready to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/56&quot;&gt;biosig&lt;/a&gt; is a WIP. It required &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libb64&quot;&gt;libb64&lt;/a&gt; which was approved this week and is
currently in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-duecredit&quot;&gt;python-duecredit&lt;/a&gt; is currently in testing. It should be pushed to stable in a
few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-visionegg-quest&quot;&gt;python-visionegg-quest&lt;/a&gt; is currently in testing. It should be pushed to stable in a

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nibabel&quot;&gt;python-nibabel&lt;/a&gt; was updated to the latest version and is currently in
testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-grabbit&quot;&gt;python-grabbit&lt;/a&gt; was updated to the latest version and is currently in
testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the way to building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/3&quot;&gt;fsleyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fslpy&quot;&gt;fslpy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fsleyes-props&quot;&gt;fsleyes-props&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fsleyes-widgets&quot;&gt;fsleyes-widgets&lt;/a&gt;
have all been reviewed, approved, and are now in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nitime&quot;&gt;python-nitime&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nilearn&quot;&gt;python-nilearn&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-petlink&quot;&gt;python-petlink&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing. This also required an update
to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-simplewrap&quot;&gt;python-simplewrap&lt;/a&gt;. Upstream was really quick to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/spedemon/petlink/issues/2&quot;&gt;make the required fixes
for us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All new packages must go through &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;'s QA (testing) process before being
made available to end users in the repositories. You can help test these
packages following the instructions &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing?rd=QA/Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the software we worked on this week was related to neuro-imaging, and
fortunately, a lot of it was Python based which is usually quite simple to
build. The coming week, though, I intend to work on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; isn't the easiest to build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It depends on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv&quot;&gt;iv&lt;/a&gt;, which bundles a really old version of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/&quot;&gt;libtiff&lt;/a&gt;. I've filed
a ticket &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv/issues/3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about
this, but have not had the time to port the code to the newest version of
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/&quot;&gt;libtiff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; bundles &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/Random123&quot;&gt;Random123&lt;/a&gt;, which was relatively easy to remove. However,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; also bundles a really old version of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials&quot;&gt;SUNDIALS&lt;/a&gt; libraries, and
updating the code to use the latest versions is not straightforward. I have
filed an issue about it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; now. This is based on
my initial investigations into building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;. So there's a chance that
more work will need to be done once these issues are solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of software available in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; already. You can see the
complete list &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig&quot;&gt;here on Fedora SCM&lt;/a&gt;. Software that is currently
being worked on is listed &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;on our Pagure project instance&lt;/a&gt;. If you use software that
is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

be possible without our friends in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; community that have helped with

Not the basics of your ablutions, your plumbing, and stuffing your cake-hole with, um, cake. Not the daily cycle of home-work-home-TV. But the extra-ordinary things, the things that take that little extra effort. Watching a film at the cinema; playing sport; entertaining friends? Bathing the elephant; crocheting a teddy bear; continuing construction of your Lego cerebellum granule cell layer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about publishing a scientific paper? A singular work of deep scholarship, analysis, or experiment, publishing a scientific paper is an exceptional thing by anyone’s standards. A recent report in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8&quot;&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; a select group of scientists who published one paper every five days for at least a year. One paper every five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means each of these scientists was listed among the authors on at least 72 papers in a single calendar year. And these were not the thousand-plus lists of authors on papers from particle physics, not those gigantic teams of atom-smashers at CERN. These were papers about research into the effects of genes within large populations, or tracking human health over our lifespan, or neurology. Research that some would consider everyday, run-of-the-mill science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many possible reactions to this hyper-productive cadre. Some would feel the sting of inadequacy, contemplating how they sweated and bled on the torturous path to build one paper, and wondering how they took such a long and winding road when there exist scientists who can apparently produce effortlessly. Others would interpret the same contemplation of their own experience as awe, placing such evidently extraordinary scientific talents on a pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensible reaction is of the absurd. At that prodigious rate, the scientists who authored more than 72 papers a year are unlikely even to have read all of them. Let alone contributed directly to the work inside, writing a few words or providing some key idea. Let alone doing some meaningful science in their construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be permitted to think “what the fork!?” The mere existence of papers whose authors haven’t even read them is the big red flag that the exponential increase in scientific output is showing no signs of slowing down. Rough estimates claim somewhere between one to two million scientific papers are published every year. That’s 5470 every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: who are these papers for? Who are those one paper every 5 days for, if even their own authors have not read them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly, no one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a nihilistic version of this answer, which runs as follows. Papers exist as the productive unit of science. Measuring science by its papers reduces it to a time-and-motion study of counting the number of papers and proclaiming brilliance, to the weigh-in of a fishing competition where the heaviest stack of papers is proclaimed the winner. Potted biographies of famous scientists routinely say “Professor X has authored over 300 scientific articles”. And you wonder: really? (And also: how did he fit all that in with Magneto wiping his hard drive every five minutes?). The counting is what counts. Not the content, not the ideas, just the mere existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less nihilistic version of “no one” is that papers need not have an audience. Indeed, reading many of them, it becomes plain that the authors forget someone else is supposed to read these things, as they dive into their personal patois, piling noun upon noun upon noun until your brain is begging for an adverb, an adjective, hell even a pronoun would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, papers need not have an audience right now, but one day. For there are two types of scientific paper. There are those that give a shove to knowledge: they prove something right (we should all go in this direction); they prove something wrong (stop going in this direction); or they tell of a new method everyone should know about and use immediately. The kind of papers that make the mainstream news. (More accurately, papers dressed up to look like these kinds of shoves to knowledge make the news). These are the papers meant to be read right now. But they are few in number compared to the total outpouring of papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most papers are archival knowledge. Scientists find something out, make a record of it, and publish it as a paper. Then future scientists can build on it, use it, when there is a reason to. When it becomes apparent, for example, that knowing how a tiny piece of bacterial DNA fends off a virus is the basis for a technique that edits genes in literally anything’s DNA (CRISPR there).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archival knowledge idea might be less nihilistic, but it just pushes the problem into the future. Yes, we’d like to know what we already know; we’d like to not repeat the same ideas and experiments. But there is too much archival knowledge to imbibe. It’s like asking for a shot of single-malt whiskey, and getting a firehose of Jack Daniels in your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take dopamine. I like dopamine, and I’d like to know more about it. PubMed tells me that last year alone there were 4586 papers published on dopamine (in 2017). If I narrow that down to specifically dopamine and reward? 495 papers last year. And apparently five papers have so far been published on this in the future — 2019 (ah, academic publishing there, still so wedded to pre-digital tradition that papers which already exist have to be assigned a monthly “issue” of the journal in which they will formally appear. Despite that journal not having published on dead-tree pulp for a decade. Or ever.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but the prospect of reading 495 papers on dopamine and reward does not fill my heart with joy. Mainly a dull ache. And explicit tests of dopamine’s role in reward are just a tiny part of that story. Other things we’d like to know include how the neuron itself behaves; what its inputs are; where its outputs go; its responses to things that aren’t reward; its role in Parkinson’s disease; etcetera, etcetera. The archival knowledge about dopamine is growing faster than anyone could possibly comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also I’d like to read something that isn’t about dopamine. About how reward is encoded in prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, perhaps. About habit learning. About reinforcement learning. About cross-validated principal components analysis, because I’m just that cool. About Poppy, her hamster Wilberforce, and their starry-eyed misadventures in DoofusVille avoiding the clutches of Reginald the Malingerer and his hoard of ruffians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has no privileged position in The Flood of papers. In his biography of the insanely prolific mathematician Paul Erdos, Paul Hoffman calculated that close to a quarter of a million mathematical theorems were being published every year. Scientists have nothing on the productivity of mathematicians; but we’re drowning all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemplating The Flood leads us to some interesting conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one person can link together the existing web of literature about a single topic. And that web may never stop growing. It’s at the point where a single author of 72 papers a year cannot even link together their own papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means there is no single person who will know “the answer” to a given complex problem. So “the answer” can come in one of two guises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is a computational model of the problem. We see this epitomised in climate research. Huge computer models of the Earth’s climate synthesise an extraordinary amount of data, and bring together a vast array of individual bits of knowledge — about cycles of glacial melt and run-off, of reflections and trapping of sunlight, of feedback between carbon dioxide, temperature, and foliage, to name but a few. The model itself becomes the culmination of a vast research enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running those models gives us answers to complex problems: they might answer the questions of how temperature depends on carbon dioxide, of where those temperature changes will hit hardest and first, and of what changes to the Earth’s environment will stop those temperature changes from careening out of control. And building these models tell us what we &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; know, of where we need to fill in the gaps to make the models better, leaner, smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second guise is an AI. Groan. But the idea that an AI will someday “know” the answer should come as no surprise. After all, we already use machine-learning extensively to make sense of data-sets that are too big for one person to comb through. And what bigger data-set is there than the collective scientific knowledge of humanity? (Answer: Lego’s database of all possible permutations of small plastic bricks that make money).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06617-5&quot;&gt;It’s already happening&lt;/a&gt;. Do you not use Google or PubMed to search the literature? People are already using machine-learning to do systematic literature searches (Iris.ai, Semantic Scholar), to find links between research findings, and show them in a comprehensible form. These are fancy classifiers, learning to group together published work and data-sets by key words. Developments in language processing are beginning to let the machines link findings together to suggest hypotheses, like linking gene expression changes to mental disorders. The next step after that will be to have the machines write the literature reviews, synthesising existing knowledge into a form we mere mortals can understand, and pointing out to us what we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a machine to tell us what we don’t know is exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/05/journal-of-neuroscience-methods-paper.html&quot;&gt;Jessica and Bradley Voytek did&lt;/a&gt;. Scraping 3.5 million abstracts from PubMed, and linking them by key-words for brain regions, disorders, and cognitive functions, they built a model of neuroscientific knowledge. This model naturally has a hierarchy: “cortex”, “thalamus”, and “striatum” are all children of “brain”, for example. Which opened up a simple but effective hypothesis generator: find two concepts that share a parent, but have not been linked together in the existing literature. That pair of concepts are then candidates for linking together. (One can imagine generalising this even to a flat web of links, by seeking a pair of concepts that are each strongly associated with a third concept, but not (yet) strongly associated with each other.) Here is a dumb machine that already gives answers no human could possibly find on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as The Flood grows then, even in narrow disciplines, the machines will be the only ones who know all the links, the only ones that can put together the big picture. So even if we never develop a true AI that can by itself infer new hypotheses and create new ideas, even if that sci-fi scientist is off the table, we will still become dependent on dumb AI for the “answers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like these far-flung futures, the paper-every-5-days people still teach us a couple of valuable lessons for the here and now. For one, complaining about your work not being cited is churlish. Literatures are vast, people miss stuff, give them a break. Don’t complain, collaborate: point others to work they may have missed, and explain why it is relevant, and how it might inform their future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately they teach us that much of what we publish is worthless. I think we can safely say that any paper whose own authors haven’t read it is unlikely to contain ground-breaking information. The lesson to us all is that we should learn to ask: who am I publishing this paper for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more? Follow us at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markdhumphries&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@markdhumphries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=7ec6c5c965cf&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/handing-science-over-to-the-machines-7ec6c5c965cf&quot;&gt;Handing Science Over to the Machines&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Breech birth at home: a new study of safety outcomes</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/09/breech-birth-at-home-a-new-study-of-safety-outcomes/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/new-born-615751_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stuart Fischbein, MD, FACOG: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trained in an era and a hospital that did not see properly selected breech birth as high risk. I have supported this option my entire 32-year career. In 2010, for reasons having nothing to do with outcomes, my hospital system chose to ban vaginal breech birth as well as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). There was no hearing, no discussion, no review of the literature, and certainly no concern for our ethical obligation to offer reasonable choices to our clients and to allow them the option of informed consent and refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I had been collaborating with and assisting midwives for three decades as a back-up physician for home birth transports. In 2010, I left the hospital and began my home birth career. Unbound by rigid protocols put in place by committees and risk managers, I was free to individualize my care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my years in home birth practice, I became aware that we obstetricians project a lot of anxiety onto the women we care for. In healthy women, pregnancy is a normal physiological bodily function that works best when the women are in a safe, private environment. Midwives are experts at normal birth and, in my experience, their model of care leads to better outcomes and higher rates of satisfaction. We, as obstetricians, can learn much from them. A collaborative model, as I have adopted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our recent study&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to better outcomes with less intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most breech studies compare vaginal breech birth (VBB) to planned cesarean section. We chose to compare VBB to a similar cohort planning vaginal cephalic birth. Selection criteria for breech were more rigid than for cephalic, but outcomes were similar in both groups. Although our numbers were too small to capture rare adverse events, intrapartum transports and perineal integrity were much more related to parity than to presenting part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While breech birth at home may not be the ideal for most, it remains the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; choice for many women in this country other than cesarean for breech birth. We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%. To not offer VBB to these women is professionally irresponsible. Even primiparous breech mothers had a 76% success rate at home. This information deserves a place in informed consent discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our efforts should not be put into restricting choice but into honoring our ethical obligations to the women we serve. We can support this goal by learning and then teaching the skills that make our profession unique, by supporting colleagues who offer vaginal breech birth, and by advocating for more robust breech training &amp;amp; education from our professional societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rixa Freeze, PhD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence since the Term Breech Trial is clear that the short-term risks of VBB to the baby are small—sometimes even identical to planned cesarean section (see infographic below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we cannot forget the long-term risks of cesarean section to the baby and the short- and long-term risks to the mother. Despite this evidence, VBB is nearly impossible to obtain in the United States. For many women, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; option for a vaginal breech birth is at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; is the largest of its kind on breech birth at home. Larger datasets exist, but they do not include information about provider skill level, selection criteria, type of breech presentation, or whether the breech presentation was diagnosed before the onset of labor—all factors we addressed in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that breech birth at home leads to high rates of vaginal birth and good maternal outcomes (including postpartum transfers, blood loss, and perineal integrity). However, with only 50 breech presentations at the onset of labor, our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about uncommon adverse neonatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more high-quality data on home breech outcomes. What if we could analyze 500 home breech births rather than 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing women enormous harm by taking away their bodily autonomy when their baby is breech. In theory, state and federal laws support the principle of informed consent and informed refusal, and nearly every hospital has a patient’s bill of rights that ensures consent before medical procedures. Yet we throw these legal and ethical rights away when a baby turns bottom-first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better. We owe it to the women we care for. Women should not be forced to leave the hospital in order to exercise their right to informed consent. Every woman with a breech baby deserves access to skilled providers &lt;em&gt;in her own community&lt;/em&gt; who can support her, whether she chooses a planned cesarean section or a vaginal breech birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Outrage: It’s absolutely everywhere. Today’s world, particularly the version of it blasted into our brains by social media, offers endless fodder, from big, simmering outrages (climate change and many powerful institutions’ refusal to do anything about it) to smaller quotidian ones (every day, someone, somewhere does something offensive that comes to Twitter’s attention, leading to a gleeful pile-on).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In part because of rising awareness of the adverse consequences of unfettered digital-age outrage, and of journalistic treatments like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/april-2015/powerful-crazy-cruel&quot;&gt;So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; by Jon Ronson (which I interviewed him about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/jon-ronson-on-monica-lewinsky-and-cybershaming.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outrage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; has become a particularly potent dirty word in recent years. Outrage, the thinking goes, is an overly emotional response to a confusing world, and drives people to nasty excesses, from simple online shaming to death threats or actual violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But a new paper argues that the concept of outrage has gotten too bad a rap and that its upsides, especially as a motivator of collective action and costly helping, have been overlooked. Writing  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302249&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the psychologists Victoria Spring, Daryl Cameron and Mina Cikara detail important questions about outrage that have yet to be answered, and they highlight how certain findings – especially from the “intergroup relations” literature, in contrast to the mostly negative findings from moral psychology – suggest it can serve a useful purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35155&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;They cite two experiments, for example, in which “both naturally occurring outrage (about an ongoing conflict) and induced outrage (manipulated via video footage about the conflict) predict[ed] greater support for nonviolent peacemaking policies relative to ‘induced hope’ and ‘neutral’ emotion manipulations. Similarly, women who read that the majority of men harbour hostile sexist beliefs (versus benevolent sexist beliefs or gender-unrelated beliefs) exhibit[ed] increased anger and fury, which predict[ed] intentions to participate—and actual participation—in collective action for equal salaries. By contrast, reappraisal, aimed at reducing negative emotions such as outrage, reduce[d] participants’ reported intentions to engage in political action.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That’s all fair enough. But arguing that researchers — or anyone else — focus too much on the downsides of outrage feels like an uphill battle to fight in 2018. There are endless, endless examples of online outrage spreading out of control, doing damage most people would view as disproportionate. In 2015, for example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/victim-of-a-scary-web-shaming-speaks-out.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I wrote about&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; a woman who was driven from her home as a result of death threats after she made a failed and offensive joke about a slain law enforcement officer — and as Ronson and others have documented, there are a million stories like this one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Now, few people would deny that outrage is an important impulse for helping to make the world a better place, and for dealing with those who breach important norms. But there are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;many&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; aspects of human nature that have fundamentally important purposes, but which can also go haywire in certain contexts — especially given that most of us are now living in situations far removed from those in which our ancestors lived and evolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Take, well, cheeseburgers: Humans have evolved tendencies to seek out high-calorie foods. This tendency helped keep us alive during the evolutionary history that brought us to now. For most of that history, scarcity was the norm — a double bacon cheeseburger, to a European or African peasant hundreds of years ago, would have been a caloric bonanza the likes of which they had never before seen and might never see again. Today, of course, in much of the developed world we’re lucky not to face this sort of paucity of calories. In fact, the situation has improved so much that many of us face the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;opposite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; problem: too many calories, too easily consumed (you can buy a double bacon cheeseburger for just a few pounds, if that, whenever you want). That’s part of the reason countries like the UK and the United States have certain health problems: Many people consume far more calories than they should, because there’s so much affordable energy-rich food everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To argue that researchers or anyone else are failing to see the positive sides of outrage, in 2018, feels a bit like arguing that people are failing to see the positive sides of our desire for rich and fatty foods. It’s true, at a basic level, that it’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; we’re drawn to calories: Without that drive, we wouldn’t survive. But in 2018, for those fortunate to live in food-secure places, no one is wanting for calories, and a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;surfeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of calories is the more important and societally relevant problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Similarly, we have so many opportunities, every moment of every day, to express outrage, and so many opportunities to accidentally contribute to disproportionate anger directed at faceless, distant strangers, that it feels as though social media, 24-hour news, and other media innovations are taking a fundamentally important human drive — the ability to get outraged at norm breaches — and blowing it up into something ugly and maladaptive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Spring and her coauthors conclude their paper by writing that “we hope to promote a more complete view of outrage—as an emotion that might lead to interpersonal antagonism, but that may also act as a lever for activism on a societal scale.” And that’s a worthy goal: There’s a sturdy body of literature showing that emotion, in general, is more likely to get people to act in prosocial ways than dryer, more empirical appeals — there’s a deep truth behind the well-worn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” But that same feeling of righteous anger that can, in one case, lead people to donate to the less fortunate can, in the next, turn those same people against (to take one example) innocent migrants seeking a better life. Outrage is big and messy and hard to contain — we need it, on a fundamental level, but we should never forget its many dangers and the many ways in which it can lead to negative and inhumane outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: What is inside the head of the fossil predatory fish †Saurichthys?</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/08/what-is-inside-the-head-of-the-fossil-predatory-fish-%e2%80%a0saurichthys/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-fossil-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to our close connection to the land we live on, as well as the daily interactions we have with domesticates and wildlife around us, we may often forget that collectively, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals represent less than half of the ‘leaves’ of the vertebrate tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over 50% of living species of vertebrates are ray-finned bony fishes (Actinopterygii), a clade that has been around for almost half a billion years. Despite being masked by an overall fish-like appearance, actinopterygians comprise fossil and living evolutionary lineages that are, in loose evolutionary terms, as distinct as those of frogs and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;†Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the origins of major ray-fin lineages remain obscure. The assignment of early actinopterygian fossils to the correct branch of the tree of life remains an obstacle to acquiring a more complete picture of vertebrate evolution, and its course through major extinction events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, ray-finned fossils are found crushed in two dimensions by overlying sediments. This does not allow the observation of tremendously important internal skeletal features (e.g. the braincase, sensory structures and gill bones). Luckily, on rare occasions, carcasses were encrusted quickly in pebble-shaped nodules that secured their three-dimensional preservation, protecting the integrity of internal structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical investigations, from the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, of the internal anatomy of 3D early actinopterygians still form the core of our knowledge on the subject. Early works have employed destructive techniques, such as serial grinding, to describe internal features. As one can imagine, these results were of limited accuracy and are non-reproducible, since the original specimens were destroyed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Palaeozoic–Mesozoic †Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life. They were the first to evolve the typical ‘ambush predator’ (torpedo-like) body shape, which is nowadays encountered in gars, or needlefish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destructive investigations of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes, conducted in the 1920s, pointed towards a close relationship with modern paddlefishes and sturgeons (which are best known for their delicious eggs ‒ caviar). Although widely accepted, this hypothesized close relationship rested on weak anatomical arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we revisited the internal anatomy of †Saurichthyiformes by employing computed X-ray microtomography on 3D fossils of two species of †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; from the Early Triassic of Nepal and East Greenland.  This method is non-destructive, and results in high-resolution digital models that can be easily studied from different angles, enabling accurate comparisons with other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10597&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10597 size-large&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichtys-Skull-1024x518.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Different stages of study of the skull of †Saurichthys from East Greenland. From external anatomical interpretation (top), to digital reconstruction of X-ray tomograms (bottom). Scale bar = 1cm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We digitally reconstructed internal skeletal structures, such as the braincase, jaws, and gills. We also visualized the spaces that were, in life, occupied by the brain, cranial nerves and blood vessels, as well as the inner ear. This allowed us to infer the shape and/or course of the actual soft-tissue structures. Our reconstructions led to new anatomical discoveries, but also revealed critical flaws in classical works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst our new discoveries is the presence of large empty spaces in the snout. Additionally, we found that a bone (dermohyal), which was previously thought to be missing in †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt;, was actually fused to another bone (hyomandibula). Both features are primitive. Interestingly, we found that the gill-cover bone architecture of †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; is very similar to that of modern sturgeons and paddlefishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this new anatomical knowledge in its evolutionary context, we compared †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; with a variety of fossil and living ray-finned fishes. With the help of specialized algorithms, we analyzed a large dataset of morphological characters from dozens of bony fishes, in order to trace evolutionary affinities on the basis of anatomical similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10658&quot; style=&quot;width: 241px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10658&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-Brain-231x300.png&quot; width=&quot;231&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Tomographic renderings of brain, osseus labyrinth and nasobasal canal endocasts of †Saurichthys sp. (NHMD_157546_A)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from Article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting historical phylogenetic hypotheses, the evolutionary trees produced by our analyses do not recover †Saurichthyiformes as closely related to sturgeons and paddlefishes, implying that many of their similarities have likely evolved independently (convergently). However, the lack of internal skeletal data for many other early actinopterygians precludes a clear picture of the early ray-fin tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be too many fossil fishes out there and not enough time (and resources) to study them.  It might even seem that this work only scratches the surface of early actinopterygian evolution. Yet, through works like this, we are able to better locate specific morphological characters and also fossil species that are responsible for ‘reshuffling’ the branches of the largest partition of the vertebrate tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented anatomical knowledge of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes will doubtlessly form a solid basis for further comparisons with new fossils. Moreover, our research highlights the fact that established classical interpretations of actinopterygian anatomy need to be critically reappraised in light of new material and modern methods of anatomical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of a brown lion. Multiple tiny, green, spinning Catherine wheels with red edges. Colourful fragments of artillery soldiers and figures in uniform and action. Unfamiliar faces of well-groomed men… These are just a few of the hallucinations reported by a group of people with macular degeneration (MD), a common cause of vision loss in people aged over 40.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 per cent of people with MD – who lose vision in the centre of their visual field but whose peripheral vision is generally unaffected – develop Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), reporting hallucinations that vary from simple flashes of light and shapes to faces, animals and even complex scenes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that CBS might arise as a result of over-responsiveness – “hyper-excitability” – of certain visual regions of the cortex, after they are deprived of normal retinal input. But whether this really is the case –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and why some people with reduced vision or blindness develop them, while others don’t – has not been clear. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31142-4&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; by a team of psychologists at the University of Queensland, Australia, led by David Painter, and published in &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt;, offers some answers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35158&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painter and his team studied eight people with MD and Charles Bonnet syndrome (whose regular hallucinations include those listed at the start of this post); eight age- and gender-matched people with MD but without CBS; and eight matched controls with healthy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers presented the participants with a series of red and green flickering chequerboard patterns, to stimulate the intact peripheral region of their retinas. Using EEG (electroencephalography)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to monitor the participants’ brain activity, the researchers found a much bigger response to the flickering patterns in the early vision processing regions of the cortex in the people with MD who also have CBS, compared with both the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the CBS participants reported experiencing hallucinations during the study, so hyper-excitability of these visual processing regions does not automatically trigger hallucinations, but does seem to be a feature of the brains of people who are susceptible to them.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise triggers for hallucinations in people with CBS vary. They include low light levels, or watching TV or riding in a car. Exactly how these triggers might interact with the over-responsiveness of the visual cortex to generate hallucinations is yet to be explored.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike people with schizophrenia, individuals with CBS usually have no trouble recognising that their hallucinations are not real, and most don’t find them distressing. However a minority do, and further research may lead to treatments, write Painter and his colleagues.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings, future treatments could aim to down-regulate cortical hyperexcitability in CBS,” they write,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“perhaps through repeated application of non-invasive brain stimulation protocols that induce long-lasting plastic changes in underlying cortical networks.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Can psychology help your cooking taste better?&lt;/strong&gt; Our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginnysmithscience.com&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt; hears about the importance of food presentation, pairing and sequencing, and how our perception of food is a multi-sensory experience. She and her friends conduct a taste test using “sonic seasonings” that you can also try at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=zellnerd&quot;&gt;Professor Debra Zellner&lt;/a&gt; at MontClaire State University and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/charles-spence&quot;&gt;Professor Charles Spence&lt;/a&gt; at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have sought to look under the hood to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/30/psychotherapy-has-drug-like-effect-on-the-brain/&quot;&gt;the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. Not only can such understanding help us hone in on the precise processes that are being acted upon in therapy, thus helping us focus on these gains, they could also show where pharmacological interventions might be complementary, and where they could directly obstruct the therapeutic work. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492717303323?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Neuroimaging&lt;/i&gt; has outlined all we know so far about how therapy changes the depressed brain, and it suggests key changes occur in emotional processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35105&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team, led by Cynthia Fu and first-author Anjali Sankar at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience in London and the University of East London, conducted a search of the brain imaging literature, looking specifically for&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;studies that uncovered the brain changes associated with recovery from depression following various forms of psychotherapy, including CBT and psychodynamic psychotherapy.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17 papers they gathered hinted at some consistent patterns, such as decreased amygdala activity after therapy when looking at both emotional and more neutral stimuli, but there were also occasional results that were harder to square – for instance one study showed more activation in hippocampal areas while another study found less activation in the very same region. This inconsistency is to be expected for a still-young domain of investigation, especially when different labs are experimenting with different study designs, so shouldn’t be over-interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the review is most valuable is through the use of a meta-analysis of five studies that asked volunteers with depression to look at emotional images in the brain scanner before and after they had undertaken psychotherapy.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This showed that, after CBT, patients with major depression showed less activation in the left precentral gyrus. This area is in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is involved in thinking and reflective processes. People who are depressed exhibit more activity in this area during emotional tasks, which appears to reflect their tendency to over-process and ruminate on thoughts and worries. As such, the reduction in prefrontal cortex activity after therapy may indicate the effectiveness of therapy in discouraging such negative cognitive styles – taking things for what they are rather than using them as a springboard into contemplating a worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that, after CBT or psychodynamic psychotherapy, patients showed more activation in&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the left rostral (pregenual) anterior cingulate (see image above; healthy controls did not show this change, suggesting it was not simply due to the passage of time or practice effects at the image-viewing task). This brain area is strongly connected with core emotion processing regions, including having a suppressing effect on activity in the amygdala. Evidence already suggests that the connections between the anterior cingulate and the amygdala are weaker in major depression, explaining why emotions may feel more overwhelming. So it appears that one of the effects of psychotherapy may be the re-establishment of this damaged connection. The meta-analysis can’t tell us exactly how, but one possibility is through practices such as “cognitive re-appraisal” – finding new ways of interpreting difficult experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fu and Sankar and the rest of their team emphasise that we’re still in early days of making sense of the relationships between brain changes and clinical response, especially the extent of improvement – for instance, how much does an increase in pleasure in life relate to changes in a particular brain region? They note &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033745&quot;&gt;a study from 2012&lt;/a&gt; that took this approach, finding that extent of improvement on a depression inventory correlated with the activity change in the anterior cingulate cortex, reinforcing that this may be a key brain region worthy of further examination.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we’re still chipping away at the gargantuan task of mapping how the process of therapy plays out in the neural tissue that sits within our skulls. It’s an endeavour worth continuing – as Sankar and colleagues explain, “Understanding the mechanisms of treatments on brain activity has the potential for developing diagnostic biomarkers and identifying new targets for beneficial forms of treatment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492717303323?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis of the neural correlates of psychological therapies in major depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In temporal information processing, both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play essential roles. In particular, for interval timing learning, the cerebellum exhibits temporally localized activity around the onset of the unconditioned stimulus, whereas the basal ganglia represents the passage of time by their ramping-up activity from the onset of the conditioned stimulus to that of the unconditioned stimulus. We present a unified computational model of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia for the interval timing learning task. We report that our model reproduces the localized activity in the cerebellum and the gradual increase of the activity in the basal ganglia. These results suggest that the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play different roles in temporal information processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the unexpected outcome of two votes shook the world: the UK voting to leave the European Union, and the US electing President Donald Trump. Even the pollsters got it wrong – for example, based on the latest polling data, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; gave Clinton an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html&quot;&gt;85 per cent chance&lt;/a&gt; of winning just the day before the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate polling is important for a number of reasons. Poll results influence politicians’ campaign strategies and fundraising efforts; affect market prices and business forecasts; and they can impact voters’ perceptions and even turnout. So, when the polls are wide of the mark – as they were so badly in 2016 – many outcomes are being sent astray by misleading information.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But polling is not as simple as just asking a lot of people who they intend to vote for. Polls are often biased by who is motivated enough to respond, and people can be overly-optimistic about the likelihood they will actually vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor, outlined by Andy Brownback and Aaron Novotny of the University of Arkansas in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804318301174&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental and Behavioural Economics&lt;/i&gt;, is people feeling the need to conceal their true voting intentions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35133&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially desirable responding (SDR) can occur when people feel their position is socially unacceptable, like voting against an ethnic minority or female politician, or when revealing their views on sensitive issues such as immigration and same-sex marriage. For instance, it’s plausible that some people told pollsters they were going to vote for Clinton, while actually intending to vote for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether this was really happening, Brownback and Novotny conducted three experiments during the 2016 presidential campaign, including a telephone survey of 800 people of voting age in Arkansas, and a survey of almost 2000 US voters on Mechanical Turk.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ingenious method to tease out participants’ true or “implicit” preferences involved presenting those in the “implicit” condition with four statements around hot-button issues like gun control and climate change. The statements were balanced to reflect both conservative and liberal views, such that participants were unlikely to agree with all four. For example, people who agreed with “I think the threat of global warming is exaggerated” tended not to agree with “I prefer presidential candidates who oppose the NRA”, and vice versa. There was also a critical fifth statement, either “I often find myself agreeing with Donald Trump” or “I often find myself agreeing with Hillary Clinton”. In this implicit condition, participants were simply asked to give a total number, from 0 to 5, regarding how many statements they agreed with – the idea being that they would feel their preference for Trump or Clinton was hidden within their overall tally.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ scores in the implicit condition were later contrasted with the scores of participants in an “explicit” condition, in which they rated how many of the exact same policy statements they agreed with,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;and then, completely separately, they answered either, “Do you often find yourself agreeing with Donald Trump, yes or no?” or&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“Do you often find yourself agreeing with Hillary Clinton, yes or no?”. In this explicit condition, their candidate preference was totally transparent (more like in a typical poll), and their answer to this final question was added to the number of policy statements they agreed with. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that participants in both conditions had a score out of 5. Because participants in the implicit condition were able to indicate they agreed with Trump without admitting so overtly, then if socially desirable responding was occurring, we would expect the total number of statements agreed with to be higher when Trump featured in the implicit condition than the explicit condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what the researchers found with the results suggesting people were more likely to express agreement with Trump in the implicit condition, and more likely to agree with Clinton in the explicit condition. Interestingly, the researchers found that there was no significant effect of political ideology, so those with more conservative views weren’t more likely to show socially desirable responding than those with liberal views (based on six questions about economic ideology, covering topics like taxation, government spending and immigration). However, party affiliation did have an effect: registered Democrats in particular were more likely to suggest agreement with Trump in the implicit condition. Party identification, then, seems more important in producing this social desirability effect than the political beliefs that presumably underpin that choice. This is important, because it means socially desirable responding exacerbates the differences between the two parties, suggesting voters in each camp have less in common than they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While finding evidence of socially desirable responding in polling is interesting, it is unclear how this implicit test method could be used for more accurate polls in future, as the data it produces is too noisy. However, another group of researchers has tried a different approach with more obvious practical implications: asking people who their social circle are voting for. We know that when one person votes, their immediate family and friends are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Connected-Surprising-Networks-Friends-Everything/dp/0316036137/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;15 per cent more likely&lt;/a&gt; to vote too, and it’s likely voting choices are influenced in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0302-y&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, Mirta Galesic at the Santa Fe Institute and Max Plank Institute, and colleagues, tested this hypothesis not only with regards to the 2016 US election, but also the 2017 presidential election in France. They found that, in both cases, asking people if and how their social circle intended to vote was a more accurate predictor of the outcome than when participants only provided their own intentions or their prediction of who would win. In fact, in one poll, the researchers found that the social circle question was almost twice as accurate as reporting one’s own intentions (82 per cent vs. 46 per cent) in the five key swing states that lost Clinton the election. Asking about participants’ social circles means they don’t have to reveal their own potentially embarrassing preferences, and it indirectly increases the sample size of the poll itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was also able to track social influence over time, as the researchers started polling both personal intentions and social circle intentions in July and continued weekly until after the US voted in November. One week before the election, more participants said they would vote for Clinton than Trump. Yet, as early as September, these polls accurately predicted Trump’s win as people reported a swing towards him in their social circles. Not only that, but people who reported an intention to vote differently from their social circle were much more likely to change their own position at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pattern the researchers observed is how participants’ social circles become echo chambers. In August, supporters of both candidates reported that only around two-thirds of their social circle agreed with them. By November, Trump supporters had become much more homogenised, with 40 per cent reporting that 90 per cent or more of their circle now also supported Trump, relative to only 30 per cent of Clinton supporters saying the same. This could be for a number of reasons: switching support from third parties, deciding to vote when they originally weren’t going to, or even freezing out people who disagreed with their political views.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complementary strands of research both demonstrate flaws in traditional polling, and ways of addressing them in future. It seems likely that people represent their preferences in a socially desirable light, but it would be difficult to use the statement list methodology to predict an election outcome. Asking about a person’s social circle is a much more effective way of obtaining more accurate results, and also sheds light on other social processes at work. Hopefully this will be adopted more widely going forward, to improve polling accuracy and avoid any last-minute surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Gloria Choi, Ph.D. Named 2018 Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award Winner</title>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/gloria-choi-ph-d-named-2018-peter-gruss-young-investigator-award-winner/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) announces that Dr. Gloria Choi is the second biennial Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient. Choi is an Assistant Professor at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. Her research focuses on olfaction and social cues, as well as neuroimmunology and neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored and deeply grateful. Being recognized as the Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award winner adds to my motivation to continue striving for good, exciting and important scientific research,” said Dr. Choi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Choi received her Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Neurobiology &amp;amp; Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY, in the laboratory of Nobel Prize-winning researcher Richard Axel. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including being named one of Cell Magazine’s 40 Under 40 in 2014. As the 2018 Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient, she will be honored with a special presentation and will give a talk at MPFI’s national Sunposium conference, which takes place March 4-6, 2019 in West Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gloria Choi’s achievements continue to push the boundaries of neuroscience forward, and her ability to bring her full focus, creativity, and intellectual curiosity to a question is clearly evident in the groundbreaking research that she has already published so early in her career,” wrote Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute, who nominated Choi for this award. Desimone went on to say that Choi is a “creative and collaborative researcher who is certainly an inspiration to other young scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award is given biennially to recognize a young neuroscience investigator for significant contributions to the scientific community through collaboration, creativity, and curiosity-driven research. In addition to recognizing exceptional achievements, it also serves to support research, inspire young scientists, promote cooperation, and acknowledge the outstanding legacy that Dr. Peter Gruss built throughout his honorable career at the Max Planck Society.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The idea that the language that you speak influences how you think about and experience the world (the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity&quot;&gt;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;) has a long and storied history. A lot of research into the issue has focused on colour perception, and evidence has accumulated that people &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;whose native languages have different colour categories don’t see the world in quite the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618782181&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, Martin Maier and Rasha Abdel Rahman at the Humboldt University of Berlin report that by affecting visual processing at an early stage, such linguistic differences can even determine whether someone will see a coloured shape – or they won’t. “Our native language is thus one of the forces that determine what we consciously perceive,” they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35102&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wavelengths of light that we perceive as colours form a smooth continuum, but crucially, the colour categories that people use to divide up this spectrum &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/&quot;&gt;vary between languages&lt;/a&gt;. Maier and Abdel-Rahman studied native Greek-, Russian- and German-speakers for whom these categories differ.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both Greek and Russian, there is a dedicated category-word for “light blue” and another for “dark blue” but no specific word for “blue” as a broader category. In German (as in English), people can use qualifiers to refer to “light blue”, “navy blue” or “sky blue”, and so on, but there are no dedicated category words for these shades. On the other hand, in German (also as in English) there is a dedicated word “blue” (blau in German) to cover all the shades of blue. However, Russian, Greek and German alike have a dedicated category word for referring to all shades of “green”, just as we do in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work already showed that having a category term for something – whether it’s an object or a colour – speeds up a person’s ability to identify that item among a host of others. Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between light and dark blue colour patches than English-speakers, for example. Maier and Abdel-Rahman wanted to go further and see whether linguistic colour categories would influence the likelihood of speakers of different languages becoming conscious of something at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maier and Abdel-Rahman first tested 28 native Greek-speakers. In each trial, they were presented with a rapid series of 13 coloured stimuli, made up of geometric shapes against a differently-coloured background. The participants were asked to look out for a grey semi-circle, which always appeared at some point on every trial. The grey semi-circle was simply there to grab the participant’s attention – to make it more touch-and-go as to whether they’d notice any ensuing triangle at all. The critical test was whether participants spotted a coloured triangle when it appeared (which it did in 80 per cent of trials) and whether that varied according to its colour relative to the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the triangle was either light blue against a dark blue background circle; light green against a dark green circle; or light or dark blue against either a light or dark green background circle. At the end of each trial, the participants were asked “how much” of a triangle they had seen – nothing at all, a slight or strong impression, or a “complete” triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maier and Abdel-Rahman found that, as they’d expected, the Greek-speakers were more likely to see a triangle when it was light against dark blue (or vice versa) than when it was light green against dark green (or vice versa). This is consistent with the idea that having fundamental linguistic categories for the two types of blue made it more likely that these triangles made it into the participants’ conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers repeated the study with 29 German speakers, they found no difference in detection rates for blue against blue versus green against green triangles. But when they next ran the study on native Russian-speakers (who share the same colour categories as Greek-speakers), they replicated the hit rate pattern they had observed for the Greek-speakers – the Russian-speakers were more likely to perceive the triangle in the blue contrast condition compared with the green contrast condition, just as the researchers expected.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the studies on Greek- and German-speakers, Maier and Abdel-Rahman also used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare their participants’ brain activity during the visual tasks. The EEG results supported the idea that native language influences a very early, automatic stage of visual processing – an idea that some other researchers have disputed in the past.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The present results show for the first time that … our native language – and the color categories we apply within it – can influence whether we consciously perceive a stimulus or not,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences in blue vs. green detection rates between Greek/Russian and German participants were not big in statistical terms. Still, “language… seems to play an active role in perception and helps to optimise it in the long run,” the researchers concluded.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this group, PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer shares a joint announcement. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency in reporting benefits scientific communication on many levels. While specific needs and expectations vary across fields, the effective use of research findings relies on the availability of core information about research materials, data, and analysis. These are the underlying principles that led to the design of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines/&quot;&gt;TOP guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which outline a framework that over 1,000 journals and publishers have elected to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2017, the second major TOP guidelines workshop hosted by the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/&quot;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; led to a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/ph3zn/&quot;&gt;position paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; suggesting a standardized approach for reporting, provisionally entitled the TOP Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on discussions at that meeting and at the 2017 Peer Review Congress, in December 2017 we convened a working group of journal editors and experts to support this overall effort by developing a minimal set of reporting standards for research in the life sciences. This framework could both inform the TOP statement and serve in other contexts where better reporting can improve reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this “minimal standards” working group, we aim to draw from the collective experience of journals implementing a range of different approaches designed to enhance reporting and reproducibility (e.g. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31072-8&quot;&gt;STAR Methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;), existing life science checklists (e.g. the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852&quot;&gt;Nature Research reporting summary)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and results of recent meta-research studying the efficacy of such interventions (e.g. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187245&quot;&gt;Macleod et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183591&quot;&gt;Han et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;); to devise a set of minimal expectations that journals could agree to ask their authors to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of aligning on minimal standards is consistency in policies and expectations across journals, which is beneficial for authors as they prepare papers for publication and for reviewers as they assess them. We also hope that other major stakeholders engaged in the research cycle, including institutional review bodies and funders, will see the value of agreeing on this type of reporting standard as a minimal expectation, as broad-based endorsement from an early stage in the research life cycle would provide important support for overall adoption and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working group will provide three key deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;      A “minimal standards” framework setting out minimal expectations across four core areas of materials (including data and code), design, analysis and reporting (MDAR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;      A “minimal standards” checklist intended to operationalize the framework by serving as an implementation tool to aid authors in complying with journal policies, and editors and reviewers in assessing reporting and compliance with policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;      An “elaboration” document or user guide providing context for the “minimal standards” framework and checklist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all three outputs are intended to provide tools to help journals, researchers and other stakeholders with adoption of the minimal standards framework, we do not intend to be prescriptive about the precise mechanism of implementation and we anticipate that in many cases they will be used as a yardstick within the context of an existing reporting system. Nevertheless, we hope these tools will provide a consolidated view to help raise reporting standards across the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anticipate completing draft versions of these tools by spring 2019.  We also hope to work with a wider group of journals, as well as funders, institutions, and researchers to gather feedback and seek consensus towards defining and applying these minimal standards.  As part of this feedback stage, we will conduct a “community pilot” involving interested journals to test application of the tools we provide within the context of their procedures and community. Editors or publishers who are interested in participating are encouraged to contact Veronique Kiermer and Sowmya Swaminathan for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current working group, we have focused our efforts on life science papers because of extensive previous activity in this field in devising reporting standards for research and publication.  However, once the life science guidelines are in place we hope that we and others will be able to extend this effort to other areas of science and devise similar tools for other fields.  Ultimately, we believe that a shared understanding of expectations and clear information about experimental and analytical procedures have the potential to benefit many different areas of research as we all work towards greater transparency and the support that it provides for the progress of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are posting this notification across multiple venues to maximize communication and outreach, to give as many people as possible an opportunity to influence our thinking.  We welcome comments and suggestions within the context of any of these posts or in other venues.  If you have additional questions about our work, would like to be informed of progress, or would like to volunteer to provide input, please contact Veronique Kiermer and Sowmya Swaminathan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debate about how much a person’s character can and can’t change have occupied psychologists for decades, but a growing consensus is beginning to emerge. While our traits are relatively stable, they are not fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is often passive – that is, experience leaves its mark on personality. But excitingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/27/you-can-change-your-personality-at-will/&quot;&gt;initial findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest that we can also change ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prior research has so far not addressed, however, is whether simply desiring to change is enough (perhaps by triggering automatic, subtle shifts in our identity and behaviour), or whether we must take deliberate, active steps to change. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-53132-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; explores this question. The results show once again that wilful personality change is possible, but they also indicate that the mere desire to change is not sufficient. In fact, failing to support one’s goals with concrete action appears to backfire, leading to personality drift in the opposite direction to what was desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35109&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hudson at Southern Methodist University and his colleagues recruited 377 psychology students to take part in a 15-week study. At the start the students were told about the “Big Five” personality traits recognised by contemporary mainstream psychology (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) and invited to select any they would like to try to change across the duration of the study. The students chose an average of two traits, most often to lower their Neuroticism (i.e. to be more emotionally stable) or increase their Extraversion; the least popular desired change was to become higher in Agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the study start and through each week of the study, the students completed a 60-item personality test. Also, at the start of every week they selected a maximum of four challenges to try to complete to help them change their personality in the ways they wanted. These challenges, which varied in difficulty, came from a pool of 50 proposed by eleven personality experts. Mostly they involved concrete tasks that reflected acting in ways consistent with the traits that the students wanted to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, an easy Extraversion challenge was to say “hello” to a cashier whereas a hard Extraversion challenge was to volunteer to take a leadership role, such as on a class project. An easy Openness challenge was to read a news story about a foreign country; a harder equivalent was to seek out someone with a different opinion and ask them questions to better understand their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week the students logged whether they had achieved the challenges they’d set themselves. The challenge system was adaptive so that it proposed progressively harder challenges to students who were successful during the preceding week (or if students selected the same challenge again, the required frequency was increased). To aid motivation, a reward badge system appeared on-screen when students logged successfully completed challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with recent personality change theory, the more trait-consistent behavioural challenges that the students successfully completed, the more their personality traits shifted over the course of the study in the direction that they desired (challenge difficulty didn’t seem to make any difference to this key finding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The single largest implication of our study,” said Hudson and his team, “is that actively engaging in behaviours designed to change one’s personality traits does, in fact, predict greater amounts of trait growth across time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, accepting but not attaining challenges was associated with trait change in the opposite direction to what was desired. This has important implications for anyone considering embarking on the challenge of changing their personality. “Whether or not volitional change is an advisable pursuit may depend entirely on one’s chances of successfully attaining desired changes” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson’s team doesn’t know for sure why unattained challenges backfired in this way. One possibility is that failing to complete selected challenges was demoralising and led participants to re-evaluate their personality traits in a harsher light. For instance, an introvert who failed to meet the challenge of introducing themselves to a stranger might have adjusted their self-concept to consider themselves even more of an introvert than they had done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has a number of obvious drawbacks including the use of psychology students (who may have knowledge or expectations that differ from the general public); a reliance on the self-rating of personality; and a correlational design that means it is not possible to attribute the cause of personality change to the completed challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues can be addressed by future research that could also look into such questions as which behavioural challenges are most effective at eliciting trait change. For now the main finding is clear and important – as the researchers put it, “Merely desiring change and formulating plans is not enough; it is necessary to follow through.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Dumitriu and Alex May (Visiting Research Fellows: Artists in Residence in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire) will discuss their latest projects “ArchaeaBot” and “BioCompuation Bots” and demonstrate some of these new robotic artworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ArchaeaBot: A Post Singularity and Post Climate Change Life-form” takes the form of an underwater robotic installation that explores what ‘life’ might mean in a post singularity, post climate change future. The project is based on new research about archaea (the oldest life forms on Earth) combined with machine learning &amp;amp; artificial intelligence to create the ‘ultimate’ species for the end of the world as we know it. The project has made in collaboration with researcher/cryomicroscopist Amanda Wilson as part of the EU FET Open H2020 funded MARA project based in the Beeby Lab at Imperial College London, and with Professor Daniel Polani from the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire. The project is supported through an EMAP/EMARE artists’ residency at LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in Spain via funding from Creative Europe and with generous support from Arts Council England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“BioCompuation Bots” are a brand-new series of artworks made collaboration with Professor Volker Steuber from the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire and artistically respond directly to research projects being undertaken within the university and with international collaborators in order to engage the public and international research community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two mouse-like quadruped robots explore research into controlling Petit Mal epilepsy using LEDs embedded in the brain that can ‘reset’ genetically modified cells before a fit occurs. In the research a complex data set was analysed to work out the perfect moment to turn on the fit stopping LED, in the artwork audiences use a blue torch to reset the robot’s ‘brains’ and ‘unfreeze’ them from their virtual fit. Also in collaboration with Dr Freek Hoebeek at Erasmus University in Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another robot on tracked wheels roams around searching for smells that appeal to it and focusses on a kind of perfume designed to appeal to it. Senses such as smell are widely considered to be uniquely related to biological life and closely related to our understanding of consciousness, an assumption that this artwork throws into question. The robot explores artificial nose research being undertaken at the university with Dr Michael Schmucker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NeuroMat organizes workshop on &quot;Mathematical and Simulation Modeling in Neuroscience&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;
                              The Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (RIDC NeuroMat) will host the workshop &quot;Mathematical and Simulation Modeling in Neuroscience,&quot; to be held on November 13 and 14, in São Paulo. This event has the support of the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and the University of São Paulo Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME/USP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;This event is an opportunity to discuss the research projects and to present the achievements and current results of the NeuroMat Simulation Laboratory (SimLab). It also intends to foster more interactions between NeuroMat's mathematical and computational modelers to work on the scientific direction that has oriented the RIDC team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;Markus Diesmann, professor at Forschungszentrum Jülich and member of NeuroMat's International Advisory Board, is the workshop keynote speaker. The event scientific committee includes Antonio Carlos Roque, Antonio Galves and Jorge Stolfi.
                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Prior registration is required for those interested in receiving a certificate of participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many paradoxes of human nature is this: while many of us spend great time and energy trying to avoid negative emotions, like fear and disgust, there are others who, in an apparent act of emotional masochism, pay good money deliberately seeking out those same unpleasant feelings. Like the visitors to the &lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt; immersive theatre attraction at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarehouse.com&quot;&gt;ScareHouse&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, who spend $31 to “enjoy” being hooded, mildly electrocuted, stabbed (in a simulated fashion), and locked in a coffin, among other delights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers, led by Margee Kerr at the University of Pittsburgh, believe they may have resolved the paradox, although they caution that their findings are exploratory. For their &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51113-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, they set up a temporary EEG (electroencephalography) lab in a closet in the &lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt; attraction and found evidence that for many people who willingly submit themselves to an intensely frightening experience, the reward is a boost to their mood and energy, accompanied by a reduction in their neural reactivity. Taken together these effects could be indicative of a beneficial recalibration of their emotions – after you have been scared witless, the mundane travails of life are a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35098&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers successfully recruited 262 volunteers who had already purchased tickets to enter the &lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt; at Pittsburgh’s ScareHouse. They asked them to fill out psychology questionnaires before and after the experience. And for around 80 of them, the researchers also performed successful pre- and post-&lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt;-visit scans of their brain activity during a range of tasks, including looking at unpleasant pictures, erotic pictures, and ruminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the participants reported being in a more positive emotional state after the horror experience than before – that is, more wonderful and less awful. Those volunteers who were more stressed, tired or bored beforehand showed the greatest emotional benefits, and they tended to rate the horror experience as more intense and thrilling. Another finding was that fewer people reported feeling anxious after the &lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt; visit than before (challenging the received wisdom that fear breeds anxiety, and supporting the idea that it is anticipation that fuels anxiety, and the resolution of that anticipation fosters relief). Also, fewer people felt tired after the horror experience, indicative of an energising effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major caveat to this research is that it’s based not on the effects any scary experience, but on a deliberately self-inflicted bout of horror – what the researchers call VANE or a Voluntary Arousing Negative Experience.  This seems key because it establishes the context for the fright experience and it’s telling that it was the volunteers who felt happier before their horror visit who were more likely to say afterwards that they felt they’d challenged their fears and learned something about themselves (in turn, people who felt they’d benefited in these ways were also more likely to rate the horror experience as thrilling, intense, uncomfortable, revolting, and scary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of these subjective effects is that they reflect a kind of recalibration of the emotions, which results in feeling better, similar to how we can recalibrate our physical senses. For instance, if your house feels cold, then if you go and stand outside in the snow in shirt-sleeves, your house will feel pleasantly warm when you come back inside. This may be how fun-scary experiences work for some people – after an episode of intense, controlled horror, the return to normal life feels much more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recalibration account appeared to be supported by the readings of the participants’ brain activity, which were dialled down after the horror experience, similar to the documented effects of mindfulness meditation on brain activity. Looking at specific brain wave frequencies, the researchers observed decreased gamma and theta reactivity in volunteers after they had visited the horror &lt;em&gt;Basement&lt;/em&gt;, which could suggest “less engaged processing of environmental stressors”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, those volunteers who said they felt wonderful after the horror visit showed less gamma frequencies when asked to ruminate, which “could reflect … perhaps not [being] as compelled by thoughts that previously served to increase their stress”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Kerr and her team said that the appeal of intense, voluntary horror experiences is similar to that of thrilling sports: “Within the context of safety and control, guests allow themselves to ‘lean in’ to the fear-inducing experience and reach higher levels of psychological and undefended physiological arousal than in day-to-day experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though they said their new findings certainly need replicating (the exploratory nature of the research meant there were many statistical comparisons which increases the risk of apparently meaningful patterns arising by chance), the researchers also suggested they could have some interesting clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the therapeutic context, the closest parallel to voluntarily scaring oneself is exposure therapy, in which the client is gradually exposed to the source of their phobia. The researchers said it could be useful to explore how adding a fun or thrilling framing to exposure therapy might make it a more pleasant and rewarding experience. Conversely, for client groups who are struggling with a lack of emotion and feeling, such as can occur in depression, voluntary scary-fun experiences might offer a way to boost a person’s energy and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study could suggest that inducing high arousal via exposure to negative stimuli may be a substrate for a generation of interventions that do not work to proximally decrease, but rather to increase, arousal in people whose goal is to increase positive affect and feel ‘wonderful’,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
