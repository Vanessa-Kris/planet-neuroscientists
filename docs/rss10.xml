See footer for correct name.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we tell about someone from their face? Their favoured facial expressions can hint at their temperament, the weathering of their skin at their life history, their facial hair and makeup at their aesthetic taste. But now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08698-001&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/i&gt; suggests that we can also intuit their names, because a person’s given name influences their facial appearance in adult life. On the face of it (sorry) this is hard to believe, but the case, made across eight studies, is based on plenty of careful evidence, and also proposes a plausible explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27296&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of several experiments, Yonat Zwebner at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his team showed student participants 20 colour headshots of a person with a neutral expression and asked them to choose which of five given names they would assign to each face based on sheer intuition. The given names included the true name of the person in the photo and four alternatives. When participants picked the name that genuinely belonged to the photo’s subject, they were scored as correct. Chance performance (i.e. random guessing) would mean getting 20 per cent correct, on average, but the participants performed better, at 28 per cent. For 17 of the 20 faces they achieved greater accuracy than you’d expect based on random guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study was similar but this time Zwebner and his colleagues used photos only belonging to people from an Ashkenazi Israeli ethnic background and who were in their mid-twenties, and the mix of actual and filler names were all drawn from the same ethnic population (the intention was that this would avoid potential confounds due to participants choosing the correct name because of extrapolation from the name or ethnicity). This study also threw in a control condition – participants had the same menu of names to pick from, but the photos were covered up – the idea was to check whether participants’ were being drawn to the correct names because they were for some reason simply more pickable. In fact, participants in the control condition showed no tendency towards picking the true names, whereas participants who could see the photos managed an average face-name matching accuracy of 25 per cent (again better than you’d expect if they’d just guessed at random).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further studies, the researchers made sure they took account of the possible influence of the relative popularity of different names. They also conducted a replication in France with photos of French people and featuring French names. Whatever changes they made, the researchers found the same thing: based purely on the appearance of someone’s face, participants had an inkling of their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same proved true when the researchers programmed a computer to match names to faces. Through machine learning processes using a training set of nearly 100,000 faces drawn from an online networking site, a computer programme learned to distinguish between true and false names of faces at better than chance levels. The data was rich enough to evaluate specific comparisons, so we know that in this dataset the algorithm found it impossible to tell from her photo whether a woman was called Emilie as opposed to Jeannie, but found it almost no trouble to tell whether another woman was called Emma rather than Veronique (in this case achieving 95 per cent accuracy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? One possibility is that we give babies names that somehow reflect their physical properties, and observers are simply drawing on these same associations to guide their judgments. This would be an example of the wonderfully titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect&quot;&gt;bouba-kiki effect&lt;/a&gt;, wherein across cultures certain sounds seem soft or round, others hard or sharp. However this seems a bit of a reach, given that at the time most babies are named, they are still pretty similar-looking (sorry parents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when the researchers looked for cross-cultural effects by testing Israeli students with French stimuli and vice-versa, they found none: the participants lost the ability to match names at better than chance levels. If the bouba-kiki effects was behind it, the feel of the names – independent of their cultural meaning – would be sufficient to make the associations. So &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/02/27/dorian-gray-effect-name-alters-face/&quot;&gt;despite some earlier coverage&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t a compelling explanation for the new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zwebner and his team think it is likelier that their findings reflect some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. Within a given culture, names carry associations – historical and celebrity figures, “types” (a Kevin versus a Brad), and cues related to class or background (contrast Tony with Tristan). Once a person is named, these associations form a filter through which all their future interactions take place – starting with parental guidance and expectations, then first encounters with schoolyard peers, career guidance counselling – and even if the filter is a subtle one, over a lifetime these effects can accumulate to impact how we act in the world, and ultimately this ends up written in our faces –  by our preference for smiles over frowns, big mugging expressions over wry understated ones, or an open relaxed visage rather than one tight-lipped and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this explanation is correct, we’d expect to see a stronger influence of names upon those parts of the face and appearance that are more under voluntary control. Consistent with this, in one study the researchers found that removing hair style (arguably one of the aspects of our appearance over which we have most control) from the photos significant reduced participants’ ability to identify the correct names for the photos, though they still performed better than chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this more deeply, Zwebner’s team turned to their algorithm, investigating which pixels of each photo were most useful in making accurate name-matches, and using this data to create heat-maps of the faces. These clearly showed the margins of the faces (aside from hair itself) were next to useless and the nose and ears were also of limited value. The most important facial areas for correct name identification were the brows, eyes and mouth – areas that are habitually engaged in voluntary facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the effect due to given names is an extension of the Dorian Grey effect, the phenomenon where personality influences facial appearance. In terms of links between facial appearance and personality, we already know that short-tempered people tense certain facial muscles more frequently than do relaxed people, which can make their resting face appear angry, for example. Or that adolescent women who are more sociable are perceived as more attractive later in life, presumably because smile lines are construed as more attractive than a tight-set face.  The bundle of associations that make Celina’s name reflected in her face are arguably doing the same thing, but through a more circuitous route (for example, the name label leading to differential treatment that then contributes to personality, and finally onto the face), which would explain why the effects were statistically significant but not large in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re struggling to pick the ideal appellation for your newborn, these new findings suggest that on top of everything else you have to worry about, your decision will likely influence what they look like as an adult – but only to a small extent. If you want to predict their future appearance, you won’t find the answers by gazing at their potential namesakes. But you might get a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Nootropics: How Smart Can You Get on Smart Drugs?</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/24/nootropics-how-smart-you-can-get-on-smart-drugs/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of smart drugs is becoming “trendy”. Lots of people are taking various substances regularly, many others try them from time to time. The idea of enhancing the brain’s ability, or tapping into its unused reservoir is definitely sexy, and many people are actively looking for information on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortage of scientifically verified information is exactly the reason I’m writing this article. Although thousand of publications on “&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/18/memory-enhancement-nootropics-and-electromagnetic-stimulation/&quot;&gt;smart drugs&lt;/a&gt;”, “cognitive enhancers”, and “nootropics” etc. can be found online, the overwhelming majority of claims are unsubstantiated or unashamedly commercialized. This means that the info you come across mostly consists of descriptions of personal opinions or experiences, or compilations of facts published elsewhere, or just articles from popular media where people can write whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple websites publish all kind of rubbish just to convince you to buy yet another wonderfully effective smart drug. Few people make an effort to refer to their sources of information, not to mention to present scientific and statistical data backing their claims. This is particularly enigmatic when these articles provide recipes for various drug combinations and claim the superiority of some of these combinations/compounds over the others. However, even scientific data on the subject is rather incomplete. Many studies were done using only a small number of participants, or in the absence of any reasonable controls. On their own, studies of such kind are of little, if any, value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of nootropics were published in the last couple of years. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses combine data from multiple individual studies, thus making the data statistically significant. This is a better way of assessing the efficacy of different drugs in the general, healthy population, and these are the publications that I will mostly use as reference points in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prove that a smart drug is really smart?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart drugs (e.g., nootropics and cognitive enhancers) are defined as substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in &lt;u&gt;healthy individuals&lt;/u&gt;. The last bit is important: there are many drugs that were specifically developed to enhance brain functions in people with various cognitive disorders or deficits. Such drugs won’t necessarily smarten up healthy people, and when they do, they are not necessarily safe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/01/29/nootropics-reduce-the-severity-of-brain-trauma/&quot;&gt;Nootropics &lt;/a&gt;may come in many forms, from classical pharmaceutics in the form of pills to herbal supplements and “functional foods”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only few smart drugs that are proven to improve some aspects of cognition. Proving that a compound has the properties of a nootropic is not a simple task. There is no straightforward way of measuring whatever cognitive enhancement you may experience once the pill is taken. The drug may indeed work and visibly increase your productivity. But it may also simply improve your mood if you anticipate a positive effect. On top of this, any given drug may work for some people and not work for others. Furthermore, the use of any drug is associated with potential side effects (e.g., headaches) that might eliminate its advantages in productivity and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/14/decoding-creativity-its-in-the-genes/&quot;&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt;. If the changes in productivity can be measured using some tests, creativity still remains something arguably impossible to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How smart drugs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several mechanisms that can be involved in the functioning of smart drugs. Some drugs can increase the blood flow (and thus oxygen supply) to the brain. Others can accelerate neuronal communication through increased release of certain neuromediators or through agonistic effects on the receptors of these neuromediators. Some compounds can serve as biochemical precursors of neuromediators, others may prevent oxidative damage to brain cells or provide them with a source of energy. Some of these changes can be achieved quickly making the drugs work almost instantly. Others, such as amendment/prevention of neuronal damage, manifest themselves only after prolonged use of the drug, thus making any changes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/15/brain-training-can-we-really-enhance-our-cognitive-skills/&quot;&gt;cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt; not so fast and not so obvious (although they can still be substantial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short overview of most popular nootropics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/18/memory-enhancement-nootropics-and-electromagnetic-stimulation/&quot;&gt;Amphetamines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are a class of pharmaceuticals that include &lt;strong&gt;adderall&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dextroamphetamine&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;lisdexamphetamine&lt;/strong&gt;. The drugs were developed to treat people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and this is where their effects are the most prominent. The drugs were also demonstrated to improve episodic memory, working memory, and some aspects of attention in the general population. At low doses they improve memory consolidation, recall of information, and motivation to perform tasks that require high degree of attention. &lt;strong&gt;Ritalin&lt;/strong&gt; is structurally different from amphetamines and works through different mechanisms, although produces similar effects. Both amphetamines and ritalin improve cognitive functions, albeit only at lower doses. At high doses they stimulate other neural pathways not involved in learning that effectively cancel their positive effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wakefulness-promoting agents&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;strong&gt;modafinil&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;armodafinil&lt;/strong&gt;, increase alertness, counteract fatigue, and increase productivity and motivation. Modafinil is praised for its ability to improve reaction time, logical reasoning, and problem-solving. The drug is clinically prescribed  for a number of conditions including sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and shift work sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounds from the &lt;strong&gt;racetam family&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;piracetam, oxiracetam&lt;/strong&gt; etc.) are more extensively studied compared than the newer nootropics. Piracetam was developed back in the 1960s and has an almost perfect safety profile. Convincingly, it was shown to improve cognitive abilities, particularly in older people and those with cognitive impairment. Although piracetam is officially recognized as a nootropic, its brain-enhancing effects in healthy people are considered to be moderate. There is a number of other derivatives from this group of drugs which, allegedly, work better. A good example is &lt;strong&gt;phenotropil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; This compound was developed in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. It was demonstrated to have a memory enhancing effect. The drug can be used as a stimulant and enhances resistance to extreme temperatures and stress. Due to its stimulating effect, phenotropil is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which means that it cannot be used by athletes intending to compete in official events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xanthines, such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/26/nurturing-the-brain-part-i-caffeine/&quot;&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, are some of the most commonly used compounds with nootropic effects. In particular, they increase alertness and performance levels. Caffeine is not what comes to mind when we think of nootropics, but apparently its effect is comparable to many pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-Theanine&lt;/strong&gt;, a chemical component of green tea, is very well studied and its effects on promoting alertness and attention are confirmed by multiple research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to nutraceuticals and herbal supplements, recent studies appear to be contradictory. Some data do support the memory-enhancing effects of such plants as &lt;em&gt;Gingko biloba&lt;/em&gt;, Asian ginseng, and &lt;em&gt;Bacopa monnieri&lt;/em&gt;, but systematic reviews do not find convincing evidence of their effectiveness. It is likely that herbal supplements may work well over longer periods of time and improve cognitive abilities, but in the short term their effects are not particularly obvious. The same applies to many vitamins, such as vitamin E and B group vitamins, as well as Omega-3 fatty acids: the evidence supporting their benefits are limited at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, only few drugs are scientifically proven to be associated with moderate cognitive enhancement effects in the healthy population. Being sceptical when assessing information on smart drugs from the internet is a good idea: lots of ridiculous rubbish is published online. Most nootropics are relatively safe, but side effects are always a possibility since the response to nootropics is highly individual.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amazing journey &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;to reach this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In only 14 years of existence, PLOS has helped catalyze the rapid growth of the Open Access literature. The 200,000th article is a remarkable milestone for PLOS and for the scientific community that has supported the Open Access movement.”-Veronique Kiermer, PLOS Executive Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to take this opportunity to thank those who have helped rapidly create this large corpus of diverse, Open Access research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly 1,000,000 authors who trusted PLOS to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-publish-with-plos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;maximize the accessibility and readership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of their research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/03/thank-you-from-plos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7,000 editorial board members and 70,000+ volunteer peer reviewers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;each year for their contribution to making PLOS journals’ content strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thousands of journalists who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/press-kit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report on trusted PLOS content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online readers of our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/innovation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organization’s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who have made &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; one of the 50 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most-visited science websites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a global audience for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/2016-research-highlights&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS journal content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/open-access-funds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Funders and institutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; all over the world who supported publication of this rich body of research under a model that provides unrestriced access to all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS was incorporated in 2001 as an Open Access advocacy organization and became a publisher to prove the value of Open Access, beginning with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in 2003 and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in 2004 as open alternatives to prestigious subscription journals. In 2005, PLOS launched &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as proof of concept to show that research communities built around and across specific areas and disciplines could thrive with an Open Access model. In late December 2006, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; spearheaded the innovative editorial approach focused on evaluation of research independent of perceived impact; this editorial approach has now been adopted by journals from nearly every scientific publisher. Since its founding, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; has published more than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/search?filterJournals=PLoSONE&amp;amp;filterArticleTypes=Research+Article&amp;amp;q=publication_date%3A%5B2001-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%202017-07-19T23%3A59%3A59Z%5D&amp;amp;page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;175,000 research articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; based on three compelling features: advancing quality science for everyone, moving publication forward in all scientific disciplines, and favoring speed to publication over subjective assessment of significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, with the support of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, PLOS launched a fourth community journal, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. Together with the journal’s leadership and global community, we now proudly celebrate the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10th Anniversary of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the more than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/search?filterJournals=PLoSNTD&amp;amp;filterArticleTypes=Research+Article&amp;amp;q=publication_date%3A%5B2001-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%202017-07-19T23%3A59%3A59Z%5D&amp;amp;page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4,500 research articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that contribute to advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Access continues to gain momentum but there is further work to be done. At PLOS, we are constantly looking for ways to use emerging technology and new ideas to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open up scientific communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—to make it faster, more efficient, more connected and more useful. We look forward to the next 200,000 articles and continued involvement with the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avid readers of novels know that they often take the perspective of the characters they read about. But just how far does this mental role-playing go? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X16300997?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Memory and Language&lt;/em&gt; has provided a clever demonstration of how readily we simulate the thoughts of fictional characters. Borrowing a method from research into the psychology of deliberate forgetting, the researchers at Binghamton University, USA, show that when a story character needs to focus on remembering one series of words rather than another, the reader simulates this same memory process in their own minds. The character’s mental experience becomes the reader’s mental experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27197&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, Danielle Gunraj and her colleagues asked about 100 undergrads to read a vignette about Nadia and Lyle, who’d just moved from New York to North Dakota. Nadia decides to go shopping for their new place and makes a list of 15 items to buy from an emporium (the vignette then details the list of items). Half the participants then read that Nadia changed her mind and that she drew up a new list of items (again these are listed) to buy at Walmart. The other half the participants read that Nadia decided to go to both the emporium and Walmart to buy both lists of items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively, this is an implicit version of an established memory test used in research into deliberate forgetting: half the participants had been cued that Nadia needed to forget the first list and focus on remembering the second; the other participants had been cued that both lists should be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the vignette, Gunraj’s team gave the participants a surprise test of their memory for the two lists of items. They wanted to see how much they had simulated Nadia’s thought processes, depending on the version of the story they read. The key finding was that participants who read the version in which Nadia decided not to go the emporium and to only get the items at Walmart showed superior memory for the Walmart list compared with the participants who read the other story version. Although they didn’t show forgetting of the first, emporium list, it’s as if the Walmart-only participants had deliberately focused on remembering the second, Walmart list, just as their version of Nadia needed to do. “We conclude that Nadia’s memory experience influenced readers’ mental experience,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up experiment was similar but this time undergrads read one of two versions of a vignette about a Frenchman Pierre who was learning English and had to study a list of 15 English words for an exam. In one version, he realises he has studied the wrong list and must study a new list of 15 more words instead. In the other version, he suddenly realises he needs to study the new list as well as the old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, when the participants were given a surprise memory test for both the lists, their performance again depended on the story version they’d read. The participants who read the version in which Pierre realised he’d initially studied the wrong list showed superior memory for the second list as compared with the participants who read the other story version. Again, the participants seem to have simulated the memory processes of the fictional character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are intriguing effects, although reading a short vignette in a psychology lab is of course quite different from being immersed in a literary novel. However, arguably we should expect the memory simulation effects uncovered in this research to be even more powerful for engrossing novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential caveat relates to the task instructions. Although participants were surprised by the specific nature of the memory tests, and they weren’t given any explicit instructions to remember or forget the two lists, they were told to “read the passage from Nadia’s (or Pierre’s) perspective. Try to imagine what she is thinking and doing as you read. Furthermore, try to keep track of the details that are important to Nadia (Pierre). After reading the passage you will be asked to recall details from Nadia’s experience”. It’s not clear how much readers would have spontaneously simulated the characters’ memory processes without these instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of the exact mechanisms involved, we can conclude that readers’ mental representation was influenced by their understanding of the story character’s cognitive processes,” the researchers said. Their findings add to past research that’s shown how we automatically simulate the content of the stories we read: for instance, we are better at &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03194927&quot;&gt;remembering a story character’s current location compared with their past location&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196313&quot;&gt;we’re quicker to make bodily movements that resemble character’s actions&lt;/a&gt; described in written sentences, as if we simulate their described actions in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Channel opening and gating mechanism in AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ioavAfp-1V8/nature23479</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system. Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors are critical for synaptic strength and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated signalling is linked to numerous neurological diseases. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes in the apo, antagonist and agonist-bound states and elucidate the iris-like mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is formed by the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of M2 contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits in the ion channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel opening and identify conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor that accompany activation and desensitization. Our findings provide a framework for understanding gating across the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Glutamate receptor-like channels are essential for chemotaxis and reproduction in mosses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/7CUiwVn0_9Q/nature23478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Glutamate receptors are well characterized channels that mediate cell-to-cell communication during neurotransmission in animals. Nevertheless, information regarding their functional role in organisms without nervous systems is still limited. In plants, Glutamate Receptor-like (GLR) genes have been implicated in defence against pathogens, reproduction, control of stomata aperture and light signal transduction1–5. However, the numerous GLR genes present in angiosperm genomes (20 to 70)6 has prevented the observation of strong phenotypes in loss-of-function mutants. Here, we show that in the moss Physcomitrella patens, a basal land plant, mutation of GLR genes cause sperm failure in targeting the female reproductive organs. In addition, we show that GLR genes encode non-selective Ca2+ permeable channels that can regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ and are needed to induce the expression of a BELL1-like transcription factor essential for zygote development. Our work reveals novel functions for GLRs in sperm chemotaxis and transcriptional regulation. Sperm chemotaxis is essential for fertilization in both animals and early land plants like bryophytes and pteridophytes. Therefore, our results are suggestive that ionotropic glutamate receptors may have been conserved throughout plant evolution to mediate cell-to-cell communication during sexual reproduction.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: cGAS surveillance of micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/AlgcIhmiC88/nature23449</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 DNA is strictly compartmentalized within the nucleus to prevent autoimmunity; despite this, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic sensor of double-stranded DNA, is activated in autoinflammatory disorders and by DNA damage. Precisely how cellular DNA gains access to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. Here, we report that cGAS localizes to micronuclei arising from genome instability in a mouse model of monogenic autoinflammation, after exogenous DNA damage and spontaneously in human cancer cells. Such micronuclei occur after mis-segregation of DNA during cell division and consist of chromatin surrounded by its own nuclear membrane. Breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, leads to rapid accumulation of cGAS, providing a mechanism by which self-DNA becomes exposed to the cytosol. cGAS is activated by chromatin, and consistent with a mitotic origin, micronuclei formation and the proinflammatory response following DNA damage are cell-cycle dependent. By combining live-cell laser microdissection with single cell transcriptomics, we establish that interferon-stimulated gene expression is induced in micronucleated cells. We therefore conclude that micronuclei represent an important source of immunostimulatory DNA. As micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes also activate this pathway, recognition of micronuclei by cGAS may act as a cell-intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism that detects a range of neoplasia-inducing processes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Elements of Eoarchean life trapped in mineral inclusions</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/IvTz3P-RsEM/nature23261</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Metasedimentary rocks from Isua, West Greenland (over 3,700 million years old) contain 13C-depleted carbonaceous compounds, with isotopic ratios that are compatible with a biogenic origin. Metamorphic garnet crystals in these rocks contain trails of carbonaceous inclusions that are contiguous with carbon-rich sedimentary beds in the host rock, where carbon is fully graphitized. Previous studies have not been able to document other elements of life (mainly hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus) structurally bound to this carbonaceous material. Here we study carbonaceous inclusions armoured within garnet porphyroblasts, by in situ infrared absorption on approximately 10−21 m3 domains within these inclusions. We show that the absorption spectra are consistent with carbon bonded to nitrogen and oxygen, and probably also to phosphate. The levels of C–H or O–H bonds were found to be low. These results are consistent with biogenic organic material isolated for billions of years and thermally matured at temperatures of around 500 °C. They therefore provide spatial characterization for potentially the oldest biogenic carbon relics in Earth’s geological record. The preservation of Eoarchean organic residues within sedimentary material corroborates earlier claims for the biogenic origins of carbon in Isua metasediments.

&lt;p&gt;To lead a good life, we need to make good decisions: manage our health and financial affairs, invest in appropriate relationships, and avoid serious lapses like falling for online scams. What equips us to do this? One candidate is IQ: after all, people who score higher on intelligence tests tend to go on to do better academically and in their careers. But many of us know intellectual titans who still make grave errors of judgment in their lives. Book-smart doesn’t necessarily make you life-smart, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187116300384&quot;&gt;a new article&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Thinking Skills and Creativity&lt;/i&gt; examines the utility of IQ in navigating existence, and how another mental ability may put it in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27173&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas IQ is – crudely speaking – a measure of the mental horsepower we have for handling abstract content, some researchers say that “critical thinking” – the ability to make judgments dispassionately without jumping to false conclusions – is a separate ability. To find out if critical thinking ability might be important for real-life outcomes, perhaps even more than IQ, Heather Butler of California State University and her colleagues asked 244 participants – a mix of students and adults recruited online – to complete tests, of their IQ and critical thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intelligence test was fairly standard and covered memory, visual processing and quantitative reasoning. The critical thinking assessment involved participants evaluating courses of action in hypothetical scenarios and also considering the relevance of contextual information that could have a bearing on the decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a typical critical thinking question might require participants to explain whether they would want preschool to be mandatory for all children if research had shown that kids who attend preschool are more likely to excel at school (note this specific question wasn’t used in the test). Successful critical thinking would include recognising that correlation is not causation and reflecting on other possible explanations, and rating as valuable further information such as the income disparity between parents who send their children to preschool and other parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per previous research, critical thinking correlated with IQ moderately (.38), suggesting some overlap but that each test was measuring something distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially interested in how these measures correlated with scores on an inventory of real-world outcomes, on which participants indicated whether they had experienced events ranging from the mildly bad (e.g. fined late fees for a video rental) to the more severe (e.g. acquiring a sexually transmitted disease). The avoidance of these kinds of experiences gives an indirect measure of wise, effective decision making, and the data showed higher IQ individuals did do better. However, high critical thinking was even more strongly associated with these real-world outcomes (even after factoring out IQ). So it’s possible to have a modest IQ and navigate life wisely, or to have a high IQ and make clangers that leave your peers shaking their heads. It’s a question of critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s something that can be worked on. Critical thinking isn’t about mental resources so much as a way of looking at the world and a tool-kit to use at the relevant moments. But unfortunately, as a society, we don’t give enough attention to how to foster these skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo10327226.html&quot;&gt;Some researchers&lt;/a&gt; are very pessimistic about the benefits of formal education for critical thinking, and although &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654315605917?journalCode=rera&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; has since suggested that attending college produces improvements in critical thinking, it could not identify where the skills were coming from. It should be possible to design better ways to impart and hone these skills, skills critical for the decisions that make up the stuff of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187116300384&quot;&gt;Predicting Real-World Outcomes: Critical Thinking Ability is a Better Predictor of Life Decisions than Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/soft-2262307_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, sugar tastes good. Added sugars account for approximately 16% of total energy intake. That’s around 6 tablespoons (91 grams) of added sugar every day. The largest source of added sugars in our diet is from sugar-sweetened drinks. This is why a large amount of research is focused on the health effects of these types of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of protein-rich diets are well documented. Increasing protein intake increases satiety, increases metabolism and decreases energy intake. But what happens when we drink a sugar-sweetened beverage with our steak dinner? How does this change how our body processes and uses the nutrients from the meal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9298&quot; style=&quot;width: 315px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9298&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/room.jpg&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The 12-by-10-foot metabolic chamber that participants spent 24 hours in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we asked volunteers to spend 24 hours in a metabolic chamber on two separate occasions. The metabolic chamber is a 12-by-10-foot hermetically controlled room. This allows us to measure exactly how the body is using the nutrients from the foods. By having someone stay in a metabolic chamber, we can determine how many grams of carbohydrate, protein and fat the volunteer is using and how many calories they’re burning every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully understand how the volunteer used the nutrients from the meals, we measured oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and urinary nitrogen excretion. Nitrogen is a key component of protein and the amount excreted in urine provides an estimate of protein breakdown. Once protein utilization is known, the amount of carbohydrate and fat utilization can be correctly calculated from respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all testing procedures, the volunteers ate the exact same foods throughout the day. During one of the visits, they ate a diet consisting of 15% protein and for the other visit they ate a diet consisting of 30% protein. At each meal, they had either a sugar-sweetened drink or an artificially sweetened drink. After each meal, we asked the participant about their hunger and desire to eat certain types of foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body only expended 80 of the 120 kcals that was provided by the sugar-sweetened drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that drinking a sugar-sweetened drink with a meal significantly decreases fat use and diet-induced thermogenesis (heat production). And when we paired the sugar-sweetened drink with a protein-rich meal, the combination further decreased fat use and diet-induced thermogenesis by more than 40%. Additionally, we found that, over the course of a day, the body only expended 80 of the 120 kcals that was provided by the sugar-sweetened drink, thus creating a 40-kcal surplus independent of how much protein was in the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the impact that consuming a sugar-sweetened drink can have on energy balance and fat use. One implication of the results is that the body’s reduced metabolic efficiency after drinking a sugar-sweetened beverage can lead to a greater tendency to make and store fat. Our findings provide further insight into the potential role of sugar-sweetened drinks in the etiology of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Privacy Shield Certification Shows Our Commitment to Protecting Customer Data</title>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/07/privacy-shield-certification-shows-our-commitment-to-protecting-customer-data/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science Exchange First &amp;amp; Only R&amp;amp;D Outsourcing Platform to Receive EU-U.S. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy Shield Framework Certification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO CA, July 20, 2017 – Science Exchange today announced that it is the first and only R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform to receive EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This certification demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of sensitive data shared by its customers and scientific service providers on the Science Exchange platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and Swiss Administration, the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework provides companies with a method to conform to data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic business. This new framework replaces the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The privacy and security of data for scientific research is a top priority for our customers and service providers, and we saw this certification as an important step for Science Exchange, especially in light of recent cyberattacks that affected companies across the healthcare and biopharma industries,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “The thousands of companies that use the Science Exchange platform can be assured that we are committed to the protection of the personal and scientific data entrusted to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification, companies must commit to a range of data management requirements, including that they will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform individuals about how their data is processed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain data integrity and purpose limitation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure accountability for data transferred to third parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and certify that all requirements are met on an annual basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being the only R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform with EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification, Science Exchange is also SOC 2 compliant, which validates that the company meets standardized criteria for managing data privacy and security – a certification that is increasingly required by regulators and auditors. Science Exchange is also ISO 9001 certified, which recognizes that the company adheres to strict quality management principles and maintains a consistent quality assurance program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, the film &lt;em&gt;Lucy&lt;/em&gt; came out starring Scarlett Johansson as the eponymous heroine who is implanted with drugs that allow her to use the full capacity of her brain rather than the mere 10 per cent that the rest of us supposedly use. In response I wrote an article for WIRED “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;All you need to know about the 10 per cent brain myth in 60 seconds&lt;/a&gt;“. Soon afterwards I received an angry, acerbic 1,200-word email from a reader: “I am obviously not going to insist you take your article down since that isn’t my place,” she wrote, “but you should certainly not feel proud to be spreading such misinformed information to the public”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What particularly shocked me was not just the tone of the correspondence, but the fact this email, endorsing the 10 per cent brain myth, came from a Masters student in neuroscience at Yale. But perhaps this wasn’t such an odd occurrence. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01314/abstract&quot;&gt;new US survey&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; finds that belief in brain myths remains widespread, and moreover, that extensive education in neuroscience seems to provide little protection from such beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27063&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Macdonald at the University of Houston and her colleagues, including Lauren McGrath at the University of Denver, recruited a total of 3,877 people to take a survey of brain myths hosted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://testmybrain.org&quot;&gt;Testmybrain.org&lt;/a&gt; website. This included 3,045 members of the general public, 598 teachers, and 234 people with “high neuroscience exposure” (defined as having completed many college/university courses related to the brain or neuroscience). The researchers had sent messages to neuroscience email lists and social networks to attract people with neuroscience training to take the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey featured 32 statements about the brain, 14 of which were true (e.g. we use our brains 24 hours a day) and 18 of which were false (e.g. we only use 10 per cent of our brain). Many of the items were the same or similar to those used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00429/full&quot;&gt;earlier surveys&lt;/a&gt; of belief in neuromyths among teachers in the UK and The Netherlands. The participants’ task was simply to indicate which statements were true and which were false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that teachers endorsed fewer brain myths than the general public, and those participants with neuroscience training endorsed fewer brain myths than teachers. And yet, all three groups still displayed high levels of brain myth endorsement, especially for what Macdonald and her colleagues identify as the classic brain myths, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;Learning styles myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 93 per cent of the public, 76 per cent of teachers, and 78 per cent of those with neuroscience education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/myths/myth_17.cfm&quot;&gt;A common sign of dyslexia is seeing letters backwards&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 76 per cent of the public, 59 per cent of teachers, and 50 per cent of those with neuroscience education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130107-can-mozart-boost-brainpower&quot;&gt;Listening to classical music increases children’s reasoning ability&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 59 per cent of the public, 55 per cent of teachers, and 43 per cent of the neuroscience group) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/19/music-teachers-and-students-fall-for-music-related-neuromyths-german-study/&quot;&gt;more on music-related neuromyths&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/the-sugar-high-is-actually-just-a-parenting-myth.html?mid=twitter_scienceofus&quot;&gt;Children are less attentive after consuming sugar&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 59 per cent of the public, 50 per cent of teachers and 39 per cent of the neuroscience group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;The left-brain right-brain myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 64 per cent of the public, 49 per cent of teachers and 32 per cent of the neuroscience group)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;10 per cent myth&lt;/a&gt; (endorsed by 36 per cent of the public, 33 per cent of teachers, and 14 per cent of those with neuroscience education – my unfriendly correspondent is not alone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the participants with extensive exposure to neuroscience (most of whom said they had at a minimum a science or health-related university degree) endorsed just under half of the neuromyths (specifically 46 per cent, compared with 68 per cent average endorsement among the public and 56 per cent among teachers). Another clear pattern in the findings was that participants who believed one of the above myths were more likely than average to also endorse one or more of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are worrying because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/10-ways-brain-myths-harming-us/&quot;&gt;brain myths are harmful&lt;/a&gt;: they undermine valid neuroscience findings and they encourage bogus practices in health, education and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? Why is training in neuroscience not enough to prevent many people from endorsing some of the most hackneyed brain myths? Macdonald and her colleagues note that many of the most widely endorsed myths pertain to education and the supposed application of neuroscience to improving learning. They speculate that perhaps it’s possible to study the brain-basis of dyslexia or memory, for instance, while remaining unaware of related psychological research, such as on the behavioural manifestations of dyslexia or the findings that have challenged the concept of learning styles. In other words, perhaps the issue is partly one of different levels of explanation: just because you are schooled in neuroscience doesn’t mean you are aware of psychological findings that are pertinent to education-based neuromyths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[These findings] suggest that if educators were to take a class in neuroscience that did not specifically address neuromyths, it would be unlikely to help with dispelling the misconceptions that are most closely related to learning and education,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that programmes intended to combat belief in neuromyths might benefit from highlighting how many myths mistakenly imply that a single factor is responsible for, or indicative of, a given outcome (e.g. sugar causing bad behavior or letter reversals being a sign of dyslexia) when in fact many factors are usually involved in learning and cognition. Also, myth-busting programmes could emphasise how many of us seem to have a bias to find explanations more credible when they contain neuroscience references, no matter how gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting a few problems with the new survey (acknowledged by the researchers themselves), such as the fact the general public who took part were highly educated compared with the wider US population as a whole – of course this may suggest the observed levels of myth endorsement are an underestimate. Also, the neuroscience group in the survey self-reported their own experience of neuroscience so it’s not clear exactly what kind of courses they’d completed. And some might say that there’s an inherent problem with asking people to give a simple “true/false” response to statements about the brain – it leaves little room for nuance and some statements may be open to multiple interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore researchers investigating new drugs or treatments must work against the clock to discover effective treatments, without compromising ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we ease the process of ethics approval during public health emergencies? In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0201-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers Emilie Alirol &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; describe their experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; ethics review during the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, providing recommendations to accelerate study approval in future health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebola Virus Outbreak (2013-2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2013-2016 Ebola Outbreak was the largest outbreak of Ebola virus in history, and also the most deadly. With approximately 11,300 reported deaths, this outbreak killed more people than all previous outbreaks combined. At the start of the epidemic, Ebola virus research was limited to laboratory studies and data from previous outbreaks. There was no established vaccine available, and potential vaccines were still in early development. This proved especially concerning given the high mortality rate (40-90% dependent on country) and the large scale in which the disease was spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9254&quot; style=&quot;width: 303px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9254&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-293x300.png&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;2014 Map of Ebola outbreaks in West Africa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons, Source: CDC&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the urgency of the outbreak, the WHO decided that use of unregistered medical interventions was acceptable, provided ethical standards were not compromised. It also allowed for a streamlined review process, with the hopes of identifying potential treatments more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for future public health emergencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the outbreak, the WHO-ERC reviewed 24 new protocols and 22 amended protocols in total, including observational and interventional studies. In the article by Emilie Alirol &lt;em&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt; a number of approaches are proposed to help accelerate the study approval process, which are applicable to any future disease outbreaks, not just Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that incorrect or incomplete information was the most common hindrance of rapid ethics approval. For example, missing information on data sharing, inappropriate participant information documents, or inconsistent details like sample size. Despite time pressure, it’s recommended that documents are thoroughly reviewed to prevent unnecessary delays as these issues are avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9276&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9276&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-5-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;CDC staff member preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons; Via CDC Global&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer collaboration between local and international researchers may also prove effective. Studies during the Ebola outbreak were often led by international researchers, as resources were limited in locally affected areas. Local researchers have beneficial knowledge of the local culture which can be used to encourage study participation and provide advice on appropriate study plans, ultimately fast-tracking the study process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template agreements and joint committees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more specific systems proposed includes development of template agreements for data and sample ownership and use. Many of the studies didn’t provide enough of this information which delayed approval. Because negotiating these agreements can be time consuming, the authors recommend developing template agreements which can be drafted from international consultations and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also suggest forming a Joint Ethics Review Committee, as many trials require approval from multiple ethics committees. The joint committee would include members of committees from the countries or institutions relevant to the outbreak. Rather than waiting for approval from multiple committees, a joint committee would cut approval time while also providing the value of cross-trial data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9257&quot; style=&quot;width: 209px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9257&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ebola-3-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Poster spread by the Sierra Leone Government during Ebola Outbreak&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons,  Sierra Leone Goverment with the help of Limkokwing University of Creative Technology&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation of pregnant women and children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most difficult proposal to implement would be the inclusion of pregnant women and children in clinical trials. In previous Ebola outbreaks, mortality rates of pregnant women were about 90%, and the highest mortality rates were in children 4 years old or younger. Given the high mortality in these groups, it makes them the most likely to benefit from a health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rates encouraged the WHO-ERC to request protocol amendments that include children and pregnant women in studies. Despite the potential benefits, pregnant women and children were not included in any of the studies, likely due to ethical and liability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are normally excluded from trials, children and pregnant women generally accept treatments based on data from other groups. In order to improve their clinical care during health emergencies, the authors of this article push for their inclusion during future outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for future outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of timeliness is one of the most challenging aspects of conducting clinical research during public health emergencies. The experience of Emilie Alirol&lt;em&gt; et al. &lt;/em&gt;during the Ebola Outbreak displays many of the issues researchers face during such emergencies. They provide us with useful suggestions to accelerate the ethics approval process, and these should be taken into consideration in preparation for future outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Rapid elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV by immunization in cows</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/VZd_ePKhiss/nature23301</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 No immunogen to date has reliably elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV in humans or animal models. Advances in the design of immunogens (BG505 SOSIP) that antigenically mimic the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)1 have improved the elicitation of potent isolate-specific antibody responses in rabbits2 and macaques3, but so far failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. One possible contributor to this failure is that the relevant antibody repertoires are poorly suited to target somewhat occluded conserved epitope regions on Env relative to exposed variable epitopes. To test this hypothesis, we immunized four cows with BG505 SOSIP. The antibody repertoire of cows contains long third heavy chain complementarity determining regions (HCDR3) with an ultralong subset that can reach over 70 amino acids in length4–9. Remarkably, BG505 SOSIP immunization resulted in rapid elicitation of broad and potent serum antibody responses in all four cows. Longitudinal serum analysis for one cow showed the development of neutralization breadth (20%, n = 117 cross-clade isolates) in 42 days and 96% breadth (n = 117) at 381 days. A monoclonal antibody isolated from this cow harboured an ultralong HCDR3 of 60 amino acids and neutralized 72% of cross-clade isolates (n = 117) with a potent median IC50 value of 0.028 μg ml−1. We note that breadth was elicited with a single trimer immunogen and did not require additional envelope diversity. Immunization of cows may provide an avenue to rapidly generate antibody prophylactics and therapeutics to address disease agents that have evolved to avoid human antibody responses.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ranking of genuinely important YouTube videos to have gone viral, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A&quot;&gt;this one (see above)&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 places high: it shows over 100 instances of harassment endured by a woman wearing a hidden camera as she walked around New York City for ten hours, including comments, stares, winks and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was posted in 2014 by the domestic violence activist group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ihollaback.org&quot;&gt;Hollaback!&lt;/a&gt; to highlight the prevalence of this kind of behaviour. As individual testimony, it was powerful. But, critics could argue, it was just one woman, on just one day. This is an argument they cannot use about the results of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12152/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, which the researchers, led by Elise Holland at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believe is the first to capture just how common sexual harassment and “objectification” is in the daily lives of young women – and to show the possible impact on how women think about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-one women living in Melbourne, with an average age of 22, first completed a number of surveys, including measures of their self-esteem and personality. They were also shown examples of what the researchers considered to be different forms of objectification, including gazes and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the women downloaded an app to their own smartphones and they had to respond to its survey prompts for a week: these came in the form of three questions, ten times a day, at random intervals between 10am and midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question was whether, since the last prompt, they’d been thinking about how they look to other people (rated on a scale from 0 to 100). Then, whether, since the last survey, they had been targeted by any sexually objectifying events; if they had, they could check boxes to indicate what type. And finally, whether they had witnessed anyone else being targeted by these kinds of behaviours; this included an extra option of “media image/video”, designed to capture sexual objectification in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women reported being the target of a “sexually objectifying event” on average roughly once every 2 days: 55 per cent of the events they recorded consisted of an “objectifying gaze”, while 11 per cent were cat calls or wolf whistles. Ten per cent were sexual remarks, and four per cent were “touching or fondling”. (As the researchers note, “While such severe instances of objectification may not be common everyday experiences they still occur frequently enough to have been captured in a 7-day…study with a sample of 81 women…”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also witnessed sexual objectification of another woman on average 1.35 times a day. The inclusion of a media image/video option perhaps unsurprisingly (given the way women are often portrayed in magazines and music videos) meant that the majority – roughly two thirds, in fact – of instances of witnessing objectification of other women fell into this category. But the volunteers also recorded many occasions of other women having similar experiences to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both being personally targeted and witnessing others being objectified was associated with a “substantial increase” in “self-objectification”, which can be defined as thinking about yourself as an object to be used, and the correlation was stronger when the individual was targeted themselves. This seemed to be true regardless of the women’s scores on the personality test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some limitations with the work. Though the researchers did show examples of the kinds of behaviours that they considered to be “objectifying”, not all women will perceive the same gaze, for example, in the same way. The paper also provided no detail on the sexual orientation of the women and the survey prompts didn’t allow them to indicate whether the person doing the objectifying was male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while increases in participants’ levels of self-objectification were clearly associated with the recent experience of objectifying events (at each survey point, participants were first asked to report on their feelings of self-objectification and then whether they’d experienced any objectification since the last prompt – i.e. over the past hour or two), it’s theoretically possible that if some women were generally thinking more about themselves as objects to be used, they may have noticed more objectifying gazes, for example, than they would otherwise have done.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Type III CRISPR–Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/m7hd0PfAYkk/nature23467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In many prokaryotes, type III CRISPR–Cas systems detect and degrade invasive genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference complex. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone ribonuclease that degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding by the interference complex, its Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CARF domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10 Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to an unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cysteine protease cathepsin B mediates radiation-induced bystander effects</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5qk-6hQGCiA/nature23284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) refers to a unique process in which factors released by irradiated cells or tissues exert effects on other parts of the animal not exposed to radiation, causing genomic instability, stress responses and altered apoptosis or cell proliferation. Although RIBEs have important implications for radioprotection, radiation safety and radiotherapy, the molecular identities of RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model in which to study RIBEs, and identify the cysteine protease CPR-4, a homologue of human cathepsin B, as the first RIBE factor in nematodes, to our knowledge. CPR-4 is secreted from animals irradiated with ultraviolet or ionizing gamma rays, and is the major factor in the conditioned medium that leads to the inhibition of cell death and increased embryonic lethality in unirradiated animals. Moreover, CPR-4 causes these effects and stress responses at unexposed sites distal to the irradiated tissue. The activity of CPR-4 is regulated by the p53 homologue CEP-1 in response to radiation, and CPR-4 seems to exert RIBEs by acting through the insulin-like growth factor receptor DAF-2. Our study provides crucial insights into RIBEs, and will facilitate the identification of additional RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and aldolase mediate glucose sensing by AMPK</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5jAV6FmAnH8/nature23275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The major energy source for most cells is glucose, from which ATP is generated via glycolysis and/or oxidative metabolism. Glucose deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but it is unclear whether this activation occurs solely via changes in AMP or ADP, the classical activators of AMPK. Here, we describe an AMP/ADP-independent mechanism that triggers AMPK activation by sensing the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), with AMPK being progressively activated as extracellular glucose and intracellular FBP decrease. When unoccupied by FBP, aldolases promote the formation of a lysosomal complex containing at least v-ATPase, ragulator, axin, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPK, which has previously been shown to be required for AMPK activation. Knockdown of aldolases activates AMPK even in cells with abundant glucose, whereas the catalysis-defective D34S aldolase mutant, which still binds FBP, blocks AMPK activation. Cell-free reconstitution assays show that addition of FBP disrupts the association of axin and LKB1 with v-ATPase and ragulator. Importantly, in some cell types AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios remain unchanged during acute glucose starvation, and intact AMP-binding sites on AMPK are not required for AMPK activation. These results establish that aldolase, as well as being a glycolytic enzyme, is a sensor of glucose availability that regulates AMPK.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Immunotherapy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade is effective in only a minority of patients with cancer, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Here we use a pooled in vivo genetic screening approach using CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in transplantable tumours in mice treated with immunotherapy to discover previously undescribed immunotherapy targets. We tested 2,368 genes expressed by melanoma cells to identify those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade. We recovered the known immune evasion molecules PD-L1 and CD47, and confirmed that defects in interferon-γ signalling caused resistance to immunotherapy. Tumours were sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of genes involved in several diverse pathways, including NF-κB signalling, antigen presentation and the unfolded protein response. In addition, deletion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 in tumour cells increased the efficacy of immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation and growth suppression. In vivo genetic screens in tumour models can identify new immunotherapy targets in unanticipated pathways.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 adopts a novel tetrameric architecture</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/sjz8l78s4SM/nature23269</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 TMEM175 is a lysosomal K+ channel that is important for maintaining the membrane potential and pH stability in lysosomes. It contains two homologous copies of a six-transmembrane-helix (6-TM) domain, which has no sequence homology to the canonical tetrameric K+ channels and lacks the TVGYG selectivity filter motif found in these channels. The prokaryotic TMEM175 channel, which is present in a subset of bacteria and archaea, contains only a single 6-TM domain and functions as a tetramer. Here, we present the crystal structure of a prokaryotic TMEM175 channel from Chamaesiphon minutus, CmTMEM175, the architecture of which represents a completely different fold from that of canonical K+ channels. All six transmembrane helices of CmTMEM175 are tightly packed within each subunit without undergoing domain swapping. The highly conserved TM1 helix acts as the pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in the channel tetramer. Three layers of hydrophobic residues on the carboxy-terminal half of the TM1 helices form a bottleneck along the ion conduction pathway and serve as the selectivity filter of the channel. Mutagenesis analysis suggests that the first layer of the highly conserved isoleucine residues in the filter is primarily responsible for channel selectivity. Thus, the structure of CmTMEM175 represents a novel architecture of a tetrameric cation channel whose ion selectivity mechanism appears to be distinct from that of the classical K+ channel family.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Maternal H3K27me3 controls DNA methylation-independent imprinting</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Fzco-H3gb90/nature23262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Mammalian sperm and oocytes have different epigenetic landscapes and are organized in different fashions. After fertilization, the initially distinct parental epigenomes become largely equalized with the exception of certain loci, including imprinting control regions. How parental chromatin becomes equalized and how imprinting control regions escape from this reprogramming is largely unknown. Here we profile parental allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in mouse zygotes and morula embryos, and investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these allelic sites. Integrated analyses of DNA methylome and tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identify 76 genes with paternal allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites that are devoid of DNA methylation but harbour maternal allele-specific H3K27me3. Interestingly, these genes are paternally expressed in preimplantation embryos, and ectopic removal of H3K27me3 induces maternal allele expression. H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is largely lost in the embryonic cell lineage, but at least five genes maintain their imprinted expression in the extra-embryonic cell lineage. The five genes include all paternally expressed autosomal imprinted genes previously demonstrated to be independent of oocyte DNA methylation. Thus, our study identifies maternal H3K27me3 as a DNA methylation-independent imprinting mechanism.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Distinct timescales of population coding across cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/j3SSeQ-ew7M/nature23020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance, sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds, whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively, and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the accuracy of behaviour.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The whole-genome landscape of medulloblastoma subtypes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gmzYR07rHy4/nature22973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Current therapies for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant childhood brain tumour, impose debilitating effects on the developing child, and highlight the need for molecularly targeted treatments with reduced toxicity. Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and ‘enhancer hijacking’ events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Human occupation of northern Australia by 65,000 years ago</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/RWIQH8AxZMY/nature22968</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The time of arrival of people in Australia is an unresolved question. It is relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals, Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the extinction of Australia’s megafauna. Here we report the results of new excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia. Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans.

&lt;p&gt;No sooner had the American Psychological Association released their 2015 task force report supposedly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games.aspx&quot;&gt;confirming&lt;/a&gt; that violent video games make players aggressive than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/apa-video-games-violence-364394&quot;&gt;the criticisms&lt;/a&gt; of the report started pouring in, of bias and bad practice. On the issue of whether violent games breed real-world aggression, there’s not much that you can say for certain except that there’s a lot of disagreement among experts. So of course, one more study is not going to settle this long-running debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain Imaging and Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; does do is provide a good test of a key argument made by the “violent games cause aggression” camp, namely that over time, excessive violent gameplay desensitises the emotional responsiveness of players. Using brain scanning to look for emotional desensitisation at a neural level, Gregor Szycik at Hannover Medical School and his colleagues in fact found no evidence that excessive players of violent video games are emotionally blunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26930&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two studies, each of which compared 14 excessive players of violent first-person shooter games (such as Call of Duty and Battlefield) with 14 controls who never played violent games. The average age of the participants was 22 to 23 and they were all male. The violent video game players really did invest a lot of time shooting people on-screen: in the first study, they averaged 4.9 hours violent game-play per day, and in the second study they averaged 4.6 hours daily play. They’d also been playing these games since they were six years old, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two studies were very similar: the participants lay in a brain scanner and looked at a range of emotionally positive, negative and neutral photos, most of which came from the well-used International Affective Picture System. The negative images in this series are pretty grim and include things like dead bodies or graphic, violent attacks. The positive images include cute animals, and an example of a neutral image would be a natural vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at emotional pictures led to larger increases in brain activity compared with neutral pictures, just as you’d expect, especially in neural regions responsible for emotional processing. But the key finding is that this effect didn’t vary by group: the violent video game players showed just as much neural sensitivity to the emotional pictures as the control participants. This was true even when the researchers relaxed the statistical parameters (to make it easier to find a group difference), when they lumped all the data together from the two studies, and when they zoomed in on the amygdala, a part of the brain that plays an important role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest [a need] to rethink the desensitisation hypothesis,” the researchers said. They added that this does not mean there are no consequences to playing violent video games: for instance, one possibility is that playing violent games affects how players act in response to emotional stimuli, rather than how their brains initially process such stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings build on earlier research that’s shown it’s important not to make sweeping statements on this topic: for instance, the psychological effects of violent video gameplay could depend on the character you play (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/07/effects-of-a-violent-video-game-depend-on-whether-youre-superman-or-the-joker/&quot;&gt;Superman or the Joker, for example&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21487/abstract&quot;&gt;the goals of the game&lt;/a&gt;, and in some instances violent play could even lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/01/06/could-violent-video-games-make-players-more-moral-in-the-real-world/&quot;&gt;enhanced moral emotions&lt;/a&gt;. The new results also follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00174/full&quot;&gt;similar findings&lt;/a&gt; from the same research group published earlier this year using line drawings of emotional versus neutral situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you briefly explain the changes that were made to the rules surrounding naming of new plant species at the 2011 IBC congress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every six years at International Botanical Congresses (IBC) a group of scientists who study algae, fungi and plants gather to review and change the rules for naming (nomenclature). The Nomenclature Section at the IBC in Melbourne six years ago made a big change to media allowed for publishing new nomenclatural acts (new names and the like) – previously if you wanted to describe a new species, for example, you would have to do it in a print journal (or book) and only once the journal was printed was the name available for others to use. In Melbourne, the assembled scientists voted to allow publication in journals and books that were only published electronically – no longer did we have to publish only in print media, or wait until the paper was printed on paper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;no longer did we have to publish only in print media, or wait until the paper was printed on paper!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you personally so keen on seeing these changes made?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxonomy is often seen as a dusty, old-fashioned science, and clinging to print-on-paper as the publishing world itself was moving into the electronic realm only re-enforced that image. I personally felt there was a real danger that taxonomic publications would be relegated to fewer and fewer places, that were less and less accessible to most people. For me, accessibility was also important, many of the specialist publications are not available outside rich Western institutions, and taxonomy needs to be done everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversely, why were these changes seen by some taxonomists as so controversial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even though the publishing world was slowly (or quickly) going electronic, many people were concerned about the permanency of works that were produced only electronically. Taxonomy depends upon being able to access the literature of the past, and some felt that safeguards were not well-developed and that proper archives didn’t yet exist. There were also fears about unscrupulous folk going in and changing e-published works, and about the possible disenfranchisement of those with minimal access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9286 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1127&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/800px-Haeckel_Orchidae.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long had these debates been going on in the taxonomic community? Was there a specific reason why the changes were finally passed at the 2011 congress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first proposals to allow e-publishing what was then called the Botanical Code (it’s now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants) were made to the IBC in Vienna in 2005. Although there was some support for the change, the particular way in which it was proposed was voted down. A Special Committee was then set up to further refine the changes and bring them to the Melbourne Congress. They worked for six years to make the proposal that eventually was accepted by an over-whelming majority in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on your new research, what is your assessment of the early impact of these changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, contrary to our expectations, the changes have basically had little effect on the publishing behaviour of scientists working with naming of plants. Because e-publication is now permitted as just another instance of publishing (much like it is in the publishing industry itself) taxonomists just kept on publishing in the normal way, but had a wider range of places open to them. There were not huge numbers of “rogue” journals, but conversely, the rate of species description did not speed up either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying that today, e-publication is seen as publication…. not peculiar, not outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six years on, do you feel that the taxonomic community has broadly come to accept these changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying that today, e-publication is seen as publication…. not peculiar, not outlandish. There are teething problems for sure – date of publication not on the pdf copy, no page numbers (this upsets some), or uncertainty in some journals whether the e-version is actually the final Version of record (the one that doesn’t change). But overall, the number of taxonomists publishing electronically is going up and to me this says that it is now accepted by most of us. If we all work together as a community, publishers and publishes alike, these problems will be ironed out – hopefully long before the publishing world turns its back on print-on-paper forever.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Cleaning up a public health threat – the River Ganges</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/ganges-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ganga – the holy river&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, India’s National Green Tribunal issued new, strict regulations aimed at cleaning up one of the most the polluted rivers in the world – the Ganges, or Ganga in the vernacular. According to Indian mythology, the Mother Ganges is a goddess who long ago descended from the sky to resurrect the ashes of an ancient king’s ancestors. Any Hindu who dips in or drinks from her is freed from a great deal of karmic debt. Furthermore, anyone whose  remains are scattered in her escapes immediately from the cycle of reincarnation. She is also the most respectful resting place for the carcasses of cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a water source for an estimated 400 million people, the river is home to industrial waste, sewage and human and animal remains which pose significant threats to human health. Hinduism beliefs about the holiness of the water are powerful enough to neutralise any warnings of health risks, making any public health interventions even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week’s announcement is not the first time attempts have been made at cleaning up the river. Shortly after Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014, he pledged to lead efforts to reduce pollution by building more treatment plants and moving more than 400 tanneries away from the river. But that estimated $3 billion clean-up plan has never come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulations announced last week state that no waste can be dumped within half a kilometre of the river’s edge, and that any littering of any sort will invoke an instant fine of 50,000 rupees.  No construction will be allowed within 100 meters of the river and 456 tannery units, which release effluent into the water, should be moved away from the river within the next six weeks. If they are not relocated, they will be closed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water-borne diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Ganges may be considered holy, major health risks are transmitted to the human population either by direct bathing in the dirty water or by drinking. Fecal coliform counts in the water are dangerously high and disease risks include hepatitis, typhoid, cholera, amoebic dysentery and a variety of skin afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9291&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9291&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Cholera_bacteria_SEM-300x235.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Scanning electron microscope image of &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, there were an estimated 1.3 billion people at risk for cholera in 69 countries classified as cholera-endemic, with India being among the countries with the highest number of people at risk.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/&quot;&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt; is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae.&lt;/em&gt; During the 19th century, the disease spread across the world from its original reservoir in the Ganges delta.  It is raising its head again in India this year and experts predict the disease will only become more frequent due to the added effects of climate change. If people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, for certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within a mere two hours of becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/topics/dysentery/en/&quot;&gt;Dysentery&lt;/a&gt; is a type of gastroenteritis that results in diarrhea with blood. Like cholera, dysentery is spread by fecal contamination of food and water and is usually prevalent in areas with poor sanitation. Worldwide, approximately 140 million people develop dysentery each year, and about 600,000 die.  Over 60 percent of these fatalities are children under 5 years old in developing countries. There are two main types of the disease: bacillary dysentery and amebic dysentery.  The latter is carried by the river Ganges and is caused by &lt;em&gt;Entamoeba histolytica&lt;/em&gt;, an ameba.  In areas of poor sanitation, the ameba can contaminate food and water and, as they can survive for long periods outside the body, infect other humans. They can also linger on people’s hands after using the bathroom, implying that good hygiene can reduce the risk of spreading infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/&quot;&gt;Typhoid&lt;/a&gt; occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water.  It is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhi &lt;/em&gt;and can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. It is an important public health challenge for India where it is most common, particularly among young children and especially with the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Typhoid can easily be prevented by following simple rules including proper hygiene and sanitation and persistent hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the river also led to the development of water-borne superbugs – New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-1 and NDM-4 which spread at an alarming rate, leading to a warning sparked by the World Health Organization two years later. Not only is waste contaminating the river’s water and leading to disease risk but it is also assisting in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contaminated water causes millions of cases of these diseases every year. Results of epidemiological studies assessing the relationship between the quality of water supply and sanitation versus human health vary widely and there are severe methodological difficulties involved in undertaking such studies.  One of the main reasons for these difficulties is that the fecal-oral route includes multiple routes for infection. However, there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that key to controlling these diseases is improved sanitation, the provision of clean water and the installation and maintenance of proper sewage systems or treatment facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance fluctuates throughout the day. Depending on their “chronotype” some people are sharpest in the morning (“larks”), while others generally prefer the later hours of the day (“owls”). For obvious reasons, this is mirrored in our preferred sleep routines: larks get tired in the evenings earlier and, as a consequence, also wake up earlier, while owls show the opposite pattern. Your chronotype is not something that you’re stuck with for the rest of your life, but it changes with age. In fact we’re most likely to show an owl-like chronotype during adolescence, which might at least partly explain why teenagers often stay up late and arrive at school with eyes bloodshot thanks to a hefty sleep debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if late chronotypes are so common in adolescents, why does school start so early (usually well before 9am in the UK, Netherlands and Germany)? Doesn’t that mean that many students are likely to be constantly sleep-deprived and not assessed during their biological peaks? Yes, it does! In fact, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that school kids who have a late chronotype score lower grades. But besides reduced sleep time, there are several alternative explanations for why a late chronotype could be associated with lower academic performance (such as absenteeism, for instance) as explored in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04076-y&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports. &lt;/i&gt;The researchers, led by Giulia Zerbini at University of Groningen, say their findings might help us understand the chronotype/school grade link and how we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26902&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected more than 40,000 individual exam grades across multiple school subjects from 523 pupils (aged 11 to 17) at various Dutch secondary schools. They also assessed the chronotype of the students with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) which asked them several questions about their sleep habits, including what time they went to bed, fell asleep and woke on school days compared with the weekend. These data also made it possible to calculate social jetlag, which is a rough measure of the misalignment between biological and social clocks. For example, imagine you are generally not sleepy until midnight but that you have a job that means you have to be in the office from 7am: you are likely to be at risk of developing social jetlag because it will be difficult for you to get enough sleep to fit in with your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did owls in this study get lower grades? Yes, they did. In fact, the negative association between having a late chronotype and poorer school performance was similar to the association between absenteeism from school and poorer grades! For every hour a student’s chronotype ran later, grades dropped by 0.06 (on the 0-10 Dutch grading scale). Interestingly, this effect was largely independent of sleep duration, suggesting that even when owls got enough sleep, they still performed poorly compared with larks, perhaps because of their difficulty performing at their best during certain school hours. Consistent with this, they actually achieved similar grades to larks when they took the exam in the afternoon, nearer to their own optimal time of day. A similar pattern was also seen for the association between later chronotype and having an increased risk of dismissal from class, late arrival and social jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more interesting pattern emerged when the researchers looked at school subjects separately. A later chronotype was associated with poorer performance in science (except physics), but not in humanities/linguistic subjects (in contrast, absenteeism had universally negative associations with grades). The apparently subject-specific relevance of chronotype chimes with previous studies suggesting that chronotype and time-of-day variation in performance have the most pronounced effects in areas demanding fluid intelligence, such as mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings should give policy makers food for thought. For example, they reiterate the common observation that adolescents often have late chronotypes and that early school schedules do not match their needs. And it’s not simply their fault for not going to bed early enough – often, their circadian rhythm is to blame just as much! It is promising that some British schools have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10818678/School-introduces-no-mornings-policy-for-tired-teenagers.html&quot;&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8579951.stm&quot;&gt;trialling&lt;/a&gt; later start times. Even if there is no room for modification in terms of school times, at least it could be a good idea for schools to consider postponing science subjects and exams until after lunch. Of course, this won’t transform every pupil into a potential Oxbridge graduate. But, at least it might make some of them feel less tired and help them perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;
