	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: What can brain research offer people who stutter?</title>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/540506444/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There’s something compelling about watching a person who stutters find a way to experience fluent speech. British TV viewers witnessed such a moment on Educating Yorkshire, back in 2013. When teenager &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Cm1-Qhs6U&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Musharaf Asghar&lt;/a&gt; listened to music through headphones during preparations for a speaking exam, he found that his words began to flow. Singers, like Mark Asari who is currently competing on &lt;em&gt;The Voice UK&lt;/em&gt;, also demonstrate how using the voice in song, rather than speech, can result in striking fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a range of techniques can temporarily enhance how fluently a person who stutters can speak. Changing auditory feedback by delaying it, or “drowning” it out with music, or altering habitual speaking patterns by singing, or speaking in time with a metronome, often results in an immediate increase in fluency. However, the effect disappears as soon these alterations are removed. Although the underlying mechanism isn’t completely understood, these effects indicate that people who stutter may show brain differences in how the signals guiding speech movements are integrated with feedback on the sound and feel of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies of adults who stutter do reveal differences in both the structure and the function of the circuits involved in speech production. For example, a number of studies show that the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the sensory and motor brain areas involved in speech production is less organized in people who stutter. This could affect communication between these brain areas, causing speech disfluency. There are also differences in the patterns of brain activity we see when people who stutter speak in the MRI scanner. An area in the left frontal part of the brain – an important hub in the circuit that plans and executes speech – is less active in people who stutter than in people who don’t. The equivalent area on the right side is often &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; active in people who stutter. We think this pattern of increased activity on the right could make up for the lack of activity on the left, but it might also reflect the stuttering process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can information about the brain differences in people who stutter be used? When discussing our research with people who stutter, and others with an interest in this area, it’s become clear that just knowing about these findings can help. The cause of stuttering has been debated for many years, and a “nervous personality” has erroneously been offered as a likely explanation. Another unhelpful belief is that it’s possible to “grow” or “snap” out of this way of speaking. So, being able to point to a neurological difference located in brain regions controlling speech, can be a welcome reassurance that such myths have no basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 496px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;381&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DVbk3hiyilI.jpg&quot; width=&quot;496&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image credit: An intervention session of the tDCS randomized controlled trial. Used with permission. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in neuroscience mean that brain imaging findings can now inform non-invasive brain stimulation studies aimed at increasing speech fluency. As speech therapy outcomes for adults who stutter can be limited, our team recently completed the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awy011/4831242&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; investigating whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS&lt;u&gt;)&lt;/u&gt; could be usefully applied in therapy. TDCS involves passing a very weak electrical current across two surface electrodes placed on the scalp, and through the underlying brain tissue. This changes the excitability of the targeted brain area. When it’s paired with a task, the change in brain excitability from the tDCS can interact with task-related brain activity, resulting in improved performance and learning. The parameters for safe, painless application of tDCS have been established from large body of research studies, and the equipment is portable, and relatively affordable. For these reasons tDCS has attracted interest as a therapeutic tool for conditions that affect how the brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used two temporary fluency-enhancing techniques: reading along with another person, and speaking in time with a metronome. In combination with this, we applied tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex – the key area for planning and executing speech movements which is relatively less active in people who stutter. We were interested in whether pairing tDCS with the tasks, practiced in 5 daily sessions, would increase speech fluency after the intervention was completed. Thirty adult men who stutter were randomly assigned to real tDCS or an indistinguishable “sham,” or placebo, tDCS. The group receiving real tDCS showed persistent improvement in their speech fluency six weeks following the intervention, compared to the group receiving sham. TDCS reduced stuttering symptoms by around 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that tDCS is certainly a promising approach for fluency intervention, and we are continuing to study it’s use. However, the relationship between the fluency of our speech and our perception of ourselves as speakers is far from straight-forward. For this reason, increasing speech fluency may not necessarily give a person who stutters a useful therapy outcome. In fact sometimes feeling you are “chasing fluency” can be a particularly negative experience. For example, living with a covert stutter involves avoiding any possibility of stuttering, with the constant fear that a moment of disfluency might slip through. Overtly, speech appears completely fluent, but the burden to the person who stutters to maintain this illusion is huge. Speech and Language Therapy in the United Kingdom for adults who stutter is varied so that all experiences of stuttering can be addressed. Therapy may include approaches to increase fluency, to stutter with less struggle, or to build more positive thoughts and beliefs about living with a stutter. Some combination of these approaches often yields the best outcome for any one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 454px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DVbj7DPkBRA.png&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image credit: Design of the tDCS randomized controlled trial intervention. Used with permission. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some people who stutter choose no therapy at all. An approach that is universally beneficial for educating us all about stuttering, and supporting those of us who have this condition, is to acknowledge the strength, resilience, and considerable talents of people who stutter. Five years on from the first airing of Educating Yorkshire, &lt;u&gt;Musharaf Asghar&lt;/u&gt; is now a motivational speaker. He is an inspiration, not because his stutter has disappeared from his speech (it hasn’t), but because he speaks with confidence about his experiences of living with a stutter, as one facet of who he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the brain differences that are associated with stuttering, and using this knowledge to shape and improve interventions, is one of the many ways that we can support people who stutter to live the life they choose. If a person who stutters chooses to work on their speech fluency, non-invasive brain stimulation could allow us to give them the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a post-truth world of alternative facts, there is understandable interest in the psychology behind why people are generally so wedded to their opinions and why it is so difficult to change minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know a lot about the deliberate mental processes that people engage in to protect their world view, from seeking out confirmatory evidence (the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/20/5-reasons-its-so-hard-to-think-like-a-scientist/&quot;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;“) to questioning the methods used to marshal contradictory evidence (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/10/27/five-minutes-with-the-discoverer-of-the-scientific-impotence-excuse-geoffrey-munro/&quot;&gt;scientific impotence excuse&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a team led by Michael Gilead at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618762300&quot;&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they have found evidence of rapid and involuntarily mental processes that kick-in whenever we encounter opinions we agree with, similar to the processes previously described for how we respond to basic facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers write that “their demonstration of such a knee-jerk acceptance of opinions may help explain people’s remarkable ability to remain entrenched in their convictions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33727&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background to this involves something you’ve probably heard of, the Stroop Effect – how we’re slower to name the ink colour of colour-denoting words when the word meaning doesn’t match the ink, like RED written in blue ink. The Stroop Effect occurs because our brains rapidly and involuntarily process the colour meaning of the word, which interferes with our processing of the ink colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, psychologists showed there’s a similar phenomenon for facts (they called it the “Epistemic Stroop Effect”) – we’re quicker to verify that factual, than non-factual, statements are spelled correctly, suggesting that our rapid discernment of factual accuracy interacts with our judgment about spelling (even though the factual accuracy of the statements is irrelevant to the spelling task).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, across four studies, Giliead and his team have found that something similar occurs for opinions. They composed 88 opinion statements, written in Hebrew, that covered politics, personal tastes and social issues, such as “The internet has made people more isolated” or “The internet has made people more sociable”. They presented dozens of  Israeli participants with versions of these statements that were grammatical or not (e.g. the gender or use of singular/plural were incorrect) and the participants’ task was to indicate as rapidly as possible whether the grammar was correct. Later, the participants were shown all the statements again and asked to indicate whether they agreed with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding was that participants were quicker to identify statements as grammatically correct when they agreed with the opinion expressed in the statement, compared with when they disagreed (there was no difference for time taken to identify ungrammatical statements as ungrammatical). This was the case even though their agreement with the opinion expressed in the statements was irrelevant to the grammatical task at hand. “The results demonstrate that agreement with a stated opinion can have a rapid and involuntary effect on its cognitive processing,” the researchers said, which is similar to the epistemic Stroop Effect observed for facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their final study, the researchers created a variation of the task that required participants to indicate whether statements (e.g. “coriander is tasty” or “coriander is disgusting”) indicated something positive or negative. For statements that they agreed with, participants were faster to answer “yes”, whether they were identifying that the statement was positive or identifying that it was negative. The researchers said this confirms that we have a rapid, involuntary cognitive bias is for answering in the affirmative to semantic questions about opinion statements that we agree with (ruling out effects of fluency or unfamiliarity that might have confounded the results for judging the grammar of statements in the earlier studies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current findings suggest that despite adults’ understanding of the notion of subjectivity, they may react to opinion-incongruent statements as if they were factually incorrect,” the researchers said, adding, “The distinction between factual truths and opinions held to be true is pivotal for rational discourse. However this distinction may apparently be somewhat murky within human psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally they said their paradigm provided “an addition to the social psychologists’ tool kit” that could be used as a new way to explore implicitly held opinions (providing an alternative to the implicit association test, for example). Further research could also explore whether the effect described here is moderated by factors like stress or peer pressure, or individual characteristics like one’s political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobials are integral to current medicine, both veterinary and human, towards the treatment of zoonotic and infectious diseases. Unfortunately, inappropriate antimicrobial use (AMU) often renders them ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain the well-being of both companion and food animals, all existing antimicrobial types, along with the development of new ones, need to be continuously accessible. This must be achieved with the concurrent introduction of official legislation and guidelines on the responsible use of antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, medical doctors and veterinary practitioners share serious concerns over the public health implications from the misuse of antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bva.co.uk/&quot;&gt;British Veterinary Association&lt;/a&gt; (BVA) has issued&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/News,_campaigns_and_policies/Policies/Medicines/responsible-use-of-antimicrobials-in-veterinary-practice.pdf&quot;&gt; guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the responsible use of antimicrobials, which can be summarized in the phrase ‘Correct antimicrobial: as little as possible, as much as necessary’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concerns have resulted in a very elevated profile for AMR in the past couple of years, a fact expressly evident by the production of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/en/&quot;&gt;Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oie.int/&quot;&gt;World Organisation for Animal Health&lt;/a&gt; (OIE) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/home/en/&quot;&gt;UN Food and Agriculture Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (FAO), that will combat AMR through a one-health approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, at the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/events/UNGA-meeting-amr-sept2016/en/&quot;&gt; 71st General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; of the United Nations (UN), the focus remained on constructing an international agenda to manage AMR. April 2017 saw the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldvet.org/index.php&quot;&gt; World Veterinary Association&lt;/a&gt; (WVA) issuing its&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldvet.org/uploads/docs/wva_position_on_the_use_of_antimicrobials.pdf&quot;&gt; official position&lt;/a&gt; on the use of antimicrobials. The purpose of this initiative was to limit the prevalence and development of AMR from the misuse of antimicrobials. In a similar initiative, the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bva.co.uk/&quot;&gt; British Veterinary Association&lt;/a&gt; (BVA) has issued&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/News,_campaigns_and_policies/Policies/Medicines/responsible-use-of-antimicrobials-in-veterinary-practice.pdf&quot;&gt; guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the responsible use of antimicrobials, which can be summarized in the phrase ‘Correct antimicrobial: as little as possible, as much as necessary’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the aforementioned events, &lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt; draw further motivation for the roll-out of this thematic series from the interaction with our authors and readers in recent conferences. More specifically, &lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asm.org/&quot;&gt;ASM Microbe&lt;/a&gt; 2017, where AMR was the single most central theme (read about our experience&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/22/battling-antimicrobial-resistance-at-asm-microbe-2017/&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;). The environmental aspects of AMR, the absence of official legislation for appropriate antimicrobial use, along with ways by which the farm can affect hospitals were prominent themes amongst the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt; attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=6&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNpvG4sq_aAhWE1ywKHWL0CWQQFghUMAU&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Firis.unito.it%2Fbitstream%2F2318%2F1646130%2F2%2FARAE2017-proceedings.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2EubfoKXsoszUkhbquqvki&quot;&gt;ARAE 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which is an important cornerstone in global AMR research allowing those working across different fields of AMR to come together to discuss and share ideas with an aim to mitigate the impact of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal !msorm;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the above reasons, we believe that there is no better time to roll out this long-awaited thematic series. Henceforth, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; BMC Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; would like to invite you to submit to our new thematic series: ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/call-for-papers-amr?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Veterinary_Research-Veterinary_Sciences-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_APR2018_Veterinary_antimicrobial_resistance_and_antimicrobial_use&quot;&gt;Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance and Antimicrobial Use&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thematic series will review and feature robust veterinary microbiology research and will consider studies with a broad scope of antimicrobials, ranging from antiparasitics, antiviral, antibacterial, fungicides and phytobiotics and from diverse, domesticated vertebrate animal sources, including livestock, poultry and companion animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome submissions on the drivers and mechanisms of AMR and its emergence and on the incentives/disincentives of AMU and knowledge in different production systems, and especially in food production. We will investigate the role of regulation and policies, the role of the farm environment and the animal attendants and the consequences of all of the above on public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical advances including molecular tools towards the construction of early warning systems and any other form of prevention, early diagnosis and treatment will be also considered. Review and Debate articles will also be considered, but are at the discretion of the Editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that this topic is of importance to veterinary and medical practitioners, microbiologists and policy makers, and the published articles aspire to examine the current use of antimicrobials and their implications in animals and the environment. The articles will also endeavor upon the level of resistance to antimicrobials and their prominence in terms of animal and human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit directly to &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; stating in your cover letter that you are targeting the ‘Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance and Antimicrobial Use’ collection. Alternatively you can email your pre-submission queries to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hayley.henderson@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;hayley.henderson@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cecilia.devoto@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;cecilia.devoto@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do chiselled features garner better pay? Researchers have previously found that income is associated with attractiveness, leading to the idea of both a beauty premium and an ugliness penalty. A common explanation is discrimination: employers seek out beautiful people and reject or ignore those harder on the eye. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-017-9489-6&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Business Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Satoshi Kanazawa and Mary Still have published research aiming to upset this. The biggest takeaway is that being perceived as very unattractive may not incur an income penalty at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33729&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on a longitudinal study of 20,000 young Americans, interviewed at home at age 16 and then on three more occasions up to the age of 29. Each time the interviewer rated the person’s physical attractiveness, from very unattractive to very attractive. While previous research often collapses below-average scores into one category, this research treated them separately, which turns out to be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanazawa and Still wanted to see whether the participants’ gross earnings at 29 were associated with their physical attractiveness at that or any previous age. Overall, there was a positive association between attractiveness and earnings. But there was an anomaly: very unattractive participants kept bucking the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those participants who were rated very unattractive at age 29 were earning significantly more than people judged more attractive than them, including (though to a lesser extent) the very attractive. For attractiveness measures earlier in life, which allow more persuasive claims of causality, echoes of this pattern were present, as the very unattractive went on to earn significantly more at age 29 than those who were earlier rated unattractive, and they earned in the same region or even slightly more than those who were earlier rated as attractive.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation between extreme unattractiveness and higher pay remained using median earnings and looking separately at men and women. The authors argue this is hard to square with the usual discrimination explanation for why attractiveness (or lack of it) is associated with income. After all, why would employers be less discriminatory towards the worst-looking people?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative explanation is that the highly unattractive and attractive each favour different high-value industries. But this wasn’t supported by the data – even within a given industry, those rated very unattractive still achieved higher incomes than their more attractive counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanazawa and Still prefer an explanation for the attractiveness-income link that is tied into Kanazawa’s focus on evolutionary psychology and his sometimes controversial interest in the biological significance of attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanazawa reasons that attractive people earn more because facial attractiveness is a marker of better developmental health, which in turn correlates with more intelligence, advantageous personality traits, and being stronger, fitter and taller – all factors that are associated with higher earnings. In this dataset, after accounting for these factors, the attractiveness–income link was no longer statistically significant, supporting Kanazawa’s claim that it’s these correlates of attractiveness that are driving the higher income for more attractive people, not their beauty per se. This analysis also accounted for some of the earnings benefit for the very unattractive, but not all of it – and why would it, if the assumption is that the unattractive should be less healthy developmentally, on average?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems likely to me that we are seeing two factors at work. One relates to the income advantage for increasingly attractive people, maybe the developmental health explanation, maybe something else, and then something separate is at work raising income for the very unattractive group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to what gives rise to the income advantage for the very unattractive group, the only speculation I can offer is that in this dataset the personality trait Openness to Experience – which is usually associated with higher pay – was surprisingly correlated with lower earnings and higher attractiveness, meaning it was the only “bad” trait associated with higher attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this Openness-attractiveness association be an indicator that some of the very unattractive scored especially low on Openness, and were perhaps highly devoted to a specific topic area, pursuing it obsessively to the exclusion of all distractions and eventually entering the forefront of their field? We know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/15/lets-dial-down-the-hype-about-grit-new-paper-finds-no-association-with-creative-achievement/&quot;&gt;Openness correlates negatively with the passion component of “Grit”&lt;/a&gt;, so such effects are conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very unattractive group was small, as extremes are in any population – just a few hundred participants – so we would want to investigate this again to see if these effects&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;hold.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For now, this research challenges assumptions about the potential for those born without conventional looks to find uncommon success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-017-9489-6&quot;&gt;Is There Really a Beauty Premium or an Ugliness Penalty on Earnings?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Speedy species divergence and the curious case of the blind cavefish</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/04/18/speedy-species-divergence-curious-case-blind-cavefish/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/cavefish-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world’s waters are full of weird and wonderful creatures. &lt;em&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise known as the Mexican Tetra, is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly larger than a tin of sardines and visually unremarkable, the surface variety can be spotted in rivers from Eastern Mexico all the way to Southern Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fame of &lt;em&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/em&gt; does not arise from this river dwelling surface population. Only when journeying into the dark depths of isolated limestone Central American caves, is it possible to find the oddball relatives of surface fish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within different caves, the cavefish populations have independently evolved similar traits, while sharing a common evolutionary ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each population of cavefish is characterized by a distinctive set of common traits. The loss of its eyes means it instead depends on detecting fluctuations in water pressure through its lateral lines to aid navigation. Unlike the shiny silver coloration of its river dwelling cousin, the blind cavefish populations have lost all pigmentation&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;causing their scales to appear a ghostly pale pink as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30 cavefish populations have been identified to date, with each population inheriting the name of their respective cave of residence. Within different caves, the cavefish populations have independently evolved similar traits, while sharing a common evolutionary ancestor. It is for this reason &lt;em&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/em&gt; is the model of choice for the study of convergent evolution in the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their physical differences, surface fish and cave fish are more similar than they appear. Surface –cavefish hybrids have been observed in the Chica caves of Mexico, suggesting that surface fish DNA markers could be introduced into cavefish populations through the mating of hybrids with other members of the cavefish population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA led to the widely accepted theory that at least two distinct surface residing ancestors gave rise to the present day cave populations over the period of several million years. The older ancestral stock is now thought to be extinct, with the surviving stock then invading the Western Micos caves as well as others further to the south east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1156-7?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Evolutionary_Biology-Aerospace_Medicine-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_APR2018_Curious_case_of_the_blind_cavefish&quot;&gt;study in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes a controversial view, arguing that the coalescence time of mitochondrial genes in a particular cavefish population, alone, should not be interpreted to indicate the age of the oldest cavefish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors computationally analyzed variations in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in order to date the evolutionary divergence in populations of blind Mexican cavefish. The results suggest both cavefish populations may have had a far more recent origin than previously thought, with evolutionary divergence potentially dating back to less than 20,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this hypothesis were to be correct, the blind Mexican cavefish would have become eyeless in an impressively short time. It has been suggested that the necessary alleles must have been present in ancestral surface populations to allow these alleles to reach a frequency high enough for this to occur at a sufficiently fast rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection pressures present in each cave that have allowed this to occur in parallel across different populations are also still keenly debated. The lack of need for eye development has been suggested to conserve energy for seeking food in habitats where food is scarce. A recent study has also suggested a molecular basis, where on inhibition of the protein chaperone Hsp90, increased eye size variation could be observed. However, the identification of different eye gene mutations in different cavefish populations suggests a combination of different evolutionary factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the findings of Fumey et al. were to be confirmed, it is likely &lt;em&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/em&gt; would become a favored model for deciphering the molecular basis surrounding its speedy rates of evolutionary adaptation. Nonetheless, this publication in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt; only continues to fuel the intrigue and debate surrounding the evolution of this unusual species.&lt;/p&gt;

Does it make any difference if the therapist is about the same age, for instance, or the same gender, or from the same socio-economic background?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems intuitive that it might be easier to relate to someone from a similar background. However, while a positive relationship between client and therapist is known to be one of the most important factors for a good treatment outcome, there’s been surprisingly little work on how their respective personal attributes might interact to create a successful alliance. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now work led by Alex Behn, affiliated to both the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Millennium Institute for Research in Depression and Personality, in Santiago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22616?af=R&quot;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attempts to help plug that gap.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33722&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 28 therapists and 547 adult clients, who had been referred to receive psychotherapy (of different types) for depression. Just over ten per cent had previously been hospitalised for psychiatric reasons and 90 per cent were taking psychiatric medication when they joined the study. All of the therapists had a degree in psychology, and they saw the clients in weekly individual sessions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before their first sessions, the clients and the therapists reported on their gender, age and average monthly family income. Based on these responses, they were classed as male/female; young adults (18-25), adults (aged 25-40), middle aged (40-60) or older people (aged 60 years and up); and as low-middle income class, high-middle income class or “vulnerable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week, from the second session until the seventh, when the study ended (but not necessarily the sessions), the clients also completed an inventory designed to assess the quality of the therapeutic alliance based on how much they agreed with their therapist on goals and the tasks necessary to achieve them, and also the quality of the emotional bond between them.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all their analyses, the researchers controlled for initial symptom severity because this is known to affect the therapeutic alliance (the alliance is usually rated more negatively by clients with more severe problems).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, having a therapist of the same or different gender made no difference to how clients rated the therapeutic relationship with one exception: male clients with a female therapist showed some sharper downturns in the alliance over the first few sessions. However, this recovered from the fourth session onwards. There wasn’t any evidence for the so-called “female effect” documented in earlier research, in which female clients enjoy a more positive alliance with a female therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the therapist was the same age, or especially if they were younger, there was evidence for extra positive relationship growth over the course of the study – what the researchers called a “youth effect”, although they don’t give any explanation for why this might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of socioeconomic class, you might think that it would be easier to strike a rapport with someone from a similar economic background. In fact the opposite seemed to be true – clients reported greater gains in therapeutic alliance when their therapist was from a wealthier background. The researchers called this an “affluence effect” and they said it might be “related to the increase in social trust observed when income status increases”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Particular forms of age and income match appear to allow for an additional improvement in the rate of initial change in the therapeutic alliance,” the researchers concluded. However they admitted that it is not possible to say from this study whether the extra growth in alliance associated with the “youth effect” or “affluence effect” actually improved treatment outcomes (although other research on the importance of therapeutic alliance suggests that it might). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22616?af=R&quot;&gt;Client and therapist match on gender, age, and income: Does match within the therapeutic dyad predict early growth in the therapeutic alliance?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/04/17/smokers-worse-diets-non-smokers/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/smoking-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested in the literature that concern about weight gain is a barrier to smoking cessation. Dietary energy density (ED; kcal/g) is an established risk factor for obesity and a marker for diet quality. Diets low in energy density may reduce risk of weight gain. However, little is known about the relationship between diet quality and smoking status in US adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Dr Jacqueline Vernarelli and colleagues at Fairfield University and Yale University in the United States looked at dietary data taken from a nationally representative sample of 5,293 U.S. adults who had been asked to report what they had eaten in the past 24 hours. Smokers were identified as individuals reporting more than 100 lifetime cigarettes and never smokers as those reporting less than 100 lifetime cigarettes. Current smokers were further classified as daily smokers (smoking cigarettes every day) and nondaily smokers (identifies as a smoker, but does not smoke cigarettes every day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-10104 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/slimming-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The researchers calculated the average dietary energy density of each participant’s diet and, after accounting for factors such as age, race, sex, physical activity and body mass index, found that smokers consumed around 200 more calories a day than non-smokers or former smokers, even though they ate significantly smaller portions of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who had never smoked consumed around 1.79 calories per gram of food, daily smokers consumed 2.02 kcal/g and non-daily smokers consumed 1.89 kcal/g. The researchers also found that former smokers consumed more calories per gram of food (1.84kcal/g) than those who had never smoked, but the former smokers’ dietary energy density was still significantly lower than that of current smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-10103 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/pepper-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The calorie dense diets consumed by the smokers whose data was used in this study often included less fruit and vegetables, which means their intake of vitamin C was likely to be lower. The authors suggest that this deficiency could potentially put smokers at further risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, presenting a major public health concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As dietary energy density is a marker for both diet quality and a risk factor for obesity, the results of the study suggest that the consumption of a diet low in energy density may be a successful strategy for preventing weight gain following smoking cessation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain science is mysterious and sexy and people are more inclined to believe claims that contain superfluous neuroscience references or neuro-imagery – an effect referred to as “the seductive allure of neuroscience” or “SANE” (that’s the short story, however the literature on the effect is messy, to say the least, with a mix of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/17/psychology-students-are-seduced-by-superfluous-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;successful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/are-we-now-blase-about-brain-scans.html&quot;&gt;failed replications&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One context where we might expect the seductive allure of neuroscience to be particularly problematic is in the emerging field of educational neuroscience, which seeks to use findings about the brain to improve educational practice. While the field holds promise, experts have warned about the dangers of neuro-jargon lending a confusing veneer of credibility to educational practices that lack an evidence base (one prominent example would be &lt;em&gt;Brain Gym&lt;/em&gt; which has been widely criticised by neuroscientists and psychologists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, however, no one had looked to see whether the seductive allure of neuroscience applies specifically in an educational context. A research group at the University of Minnesota has now attempted to plug this gap. They recently reported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12162&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Educational Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their “major finding” that the public find popular articles about the psychology of learning more credible when they contain extraneous neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33709&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soo-hyun Im and his colleagues presented 245 members of the US public with short articles (approximately 250 words) about the educational implications of psychology studies. For example, one article, based on a real psychological finding, explained that people are more likely to remember trivia answers that they feel more curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each article was either devoid of neuroscience or accompanied by varying amounts of what the researchers called “extraneous” neuroscience: a brain-based claim in the text; the same textual neuroscience claim plus a basic chart; or the textual claim plus a colourful brain-scan type image (the neuroscience references were based on real pieces of research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the article about curiosity either made no mention of the brain, or it stated that participants’ higher curiosity ratings were correlated with activity in brain areas involved in motivation, or it included this neuroscience reference plus a line chart, or the neuroscience reference plus a brain scan showing the location of the curiosity-related activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ task was to rate how credible they found each article, in terms of its quality, comprehensibleness, reasonableness, validity and how much they agreed with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants found the articles more credible when they contained the most extreme form of extraneous neuroscience – a textual neuroscience reference plus a brain scan image. This seductive allure of neuroscience effect (SANE) was greater among participants with more familiarity with educational topics and among participants with more prior knowledge of neuroscience (although their knowledge was modest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current study extended the SANE effect to the important case of articles about educational topics” the researchers concluded. “Perhaps the most important direction for future research is to investigate whether the SANE effect for educational topics holds for educational professionals such as teachers, administrators, and policy makers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no question this new research addresses an important issue. There is a lot of hype about educational neuroscience and it is important that policy-makers and teachers do not get misled by the allure of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the study features several methodological shortcomings that make it difficult to interpret the findings as showing a true SANE effect. As the researchers partly acknowledged, the addition of extraneous neuroscience information was confounded with article length and image richness. Perhaps participants simply rated longer, more graphic articles as more credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we do not really know based on these findings that there is anything especially alluring about neuroscience in an educational context – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716301585&quot;&gt;the addition of extraneous information from genetics or another field&lt;/a&gt; may have had the same or even a greater effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, even though I am sceptical about neuroscience hype I think there’s an argument that the supposedly extraneous neuroscience added to the articles was rather relevant. The brain-based information was derived from real studies and provided converging, objective evidence relevant to the psychological findings being discussed, arguably lending greater credibility to the claims. A more convincing demonstration of the SANE effect would have tested whether participants were swayed by truly superfluous and non-sensical neuroscience claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12162&quot;&gt;Extending the seductive allure of neuroscience explanations effect to popular articles about educational topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What is perhaps surprising is that at the same time, the prevalence of US households with both overweight and underweight members exceed 5% of the population. This highlights the US’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15505634&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dual burden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of weight mismanagement at both ends of the weight spectrum. Moreover, it is striking to note that this trend is accompanied by a high persistence of unhealthy dieting behaviors among youths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy dieting behaviors such as fasting for extended periods of time or purging via forced vomiting have been shown to be risk factors of several eating disorders (EDs). Unhealthy dieting is not the same as EDs since EDs are classically linked with psychological implications, but they may act as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/treatment-for-eating-disorders/special-issues/dieting&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;precursors to more severe mental disorders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and can lead to being dangerously underweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy dieting behaviors have also been shown to be ineffective for long-term weight loss for people who are overweight, and could cause weight gain in that population since they are associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743511003963?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;counter-productive practices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; such as reduced physical activities and a decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption. As seen, these behaviors could potentially exacerbate the weight mismanagement issue in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perceiving one’s weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although numerous public health strategies to combat weight mismanagement have been implemented over the years, many have focused on behavioral interventions such as diet and exercise education. In our research, we wanted to explore in detail the role of one’s perception of their own weight and so examined associations between self-perceptions of weight status, weight change intentions, and unhealthy dieting behaviors across the different sex, age, race and weight spectrum in US adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, we analyzed data from 113,542 adolescents collected between 1999 and 2013 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance System&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which monitors the health risk behaviors among 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; through 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students in the US through school-based surveys. The survey included questions on self-perception of weight, weight change intentions and unhealthy dieting behaviors. Measures of self-reported unhealthy dieting behaviors were fasting for 24 hours or more, taking diet pills/powders/liquids, and vomiting/taking laxatives, in the last 30 days in order to lose weight or keep from gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that overestimating one’s own body weight and a desire to change it were most strongly associated with unhealthy dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that adolescent girls were more likely to overestimate their weight, while boys were more likely to underestimate. Also, unhealthy dieting was more common among girls than boys, with 26.2% of girls performing an unhealthy dieting behavior in 1999 and 22.7% in 2013. These figures for boys were 10.4% in 1999 and 10.1% in 2013. After adjusting for sex, age and race, we discovered that overestimating one’s own body weight and a desire to change it were most strongly associated with unhealthy dieting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also observed significant racial disparities in unhealthy dieting behaviors, with non-white groups displaying higher levels of fasting and purging, which are important precursors of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa respectively. As racial disparities were found to have persisted over time, it could mean that minority groups may be disadvantaged in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are important as unhealthy dieting behaviors are linked to serious health consequences and can further worsen the weight mismanagement observed in US adolescents. This study suggests that high levels of weight misperceptions, particularly overestimation, increase the likelihood of clinically inappropriate weight change intentions, which was found to be associated to unhealthy dieting behaviors. Hence, public health policies should look to helping adolescents have an accurate perception of their own weight to help reduce unhealthy dieting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, there are caveats: as this study used self-reported survey data, information and recall bias may be a factor. Moreover, as we were unable to track the same individuals over time, causation between the factors could not be drawn conclusively. Nevertheless, the persistence of the high prevalence of unhealthy dieting behaviors, especially among females across all racial groups, is concerning. Further research into weight status perceptions may inform efforts to curb this worrying trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For many scientists, there is a common frustration with methods sections of research papers that lack sufficient &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2017/05/03/protocols-the-devil-is-in-the-details/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, which are necessary to follow up on the work. The mission of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is to encourage precision and to facilitate the sharing of these details.  We’re excited that our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; with them over the past year is providing yet another catalyst for transforming research communication. Our combined aim is simple: improve the rigor of published research papers by encouraging authors to report precise protocols accompanying their manuscripts on protocols.io. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“In addition to helping the PLOS papers and the scientists reading them, this partnership also had a dramatic impact on the adoption of protocols.io. The new author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; at PLOS helped protocols.io to also connect in a similar way to 200 other journals,” says protocols.io CEO Lenny Teytelman. “As a result, the number of scientists creating new protocols every month has more than tripled on protocols.io over the past year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Protocols.io-data.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12662&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Protocols.io-data.png&quot; width=&quot;836&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Partnering with organizations like protocols.io and bioRxiv is a way for PLOS to achieve its Open Science mission in the spirit of collaboration,” says PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer. “Leveraging the effective platform that protocols.io has developed enables us to take a leap forward in promoting reproducibility.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Out of the hundreds of protocols accompanying PLOS articles published over the past year, we want to highlight a few great and diverse examples of what scientists have chosen to share via their Materials &amp;amp; Methods sections:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Looking ahead to the rest of 2018: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; continues to broaden its scope to include “all research” instead of simply biomedical and the life sciences. And thanks to our continued partnership authors will soon see an improvement to the platform interface for clinical trials, neuroscience and other fields; a better experience for reporting reagents and equipment; and easier to use templates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publish with PLOS and your protocols with protocols.io and let’s keep science open, transparent and reproducible together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to pay attention effortlessly, your mind “pulled by the inherent nature of the object of experience”. In fact, with practice, doing so can “lead you to experience inner silence, tranquility, peace and transcendence”. That’s according to a research team led by Michelle Mahone at the California School of Professional Psychology, who have published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262617300635?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Brain and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; what they describe as the first neuroimaging study of people in the midst of Transcendental Meditation (TM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 women volunteers (average age 60) had practised TM for an average of 34 years, meaning they had amassed around 36,000 hours of meditation practice. The researchers scanned the meditators’ brains while they lay resting with their eyes closed and then while they meditated for 10 minutes. The volunteers’ extensive mastery at meditation allowed them to achieve “bliss”, “deep restfulness” and “clear transcending” despite the noise and discomfort of the brain scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with rest, the scans showed that while meditating the volunteers exhibited increased activity at the front of their brains (in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus), alongside reduced activity in the cerebellum and the pons – structures at the back of the brain and in the brain stem. These latter activity reductions have not been observed in brain scan studies of other forms of meditation that involve focused attention (for example on one’s breathing) or open monitoring (paying mindful non-judgmental attention to one’s thoughts and sensations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their findings were consistent with the idea that Transcendental Meditation involves a unique form of effortless attention, in which “the attention is guided by the inherent pleasure of inner transcendence, rather than through cognitive evaluation and control”. The increase in frontal brain activity reflects the engagement with a specific experience, they said, while the minimal control required was reflected in reduced activity in the cerebellum and pons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sceptical readers may feel that the researchers are guilty of “reverse inference” – making assumptions about the meaning of the brain activity patterns that they observed. Mahone’s team said further research is needed to directly compare brain activity during different meditation practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in clinical settings shows that some people with mental health problems experience extreme distress when hearing non-speech vocal sounds, like coughs and chewing noises, a phenomenon called “misophonia”. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3387?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from Amanda Seaborne at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Logan Fiorella at the University of Georgia, published in &lt;i&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology,&lt;/i&gt; suggests that this issue exists in the broader population, and that people sensitive to these sounds perform poorly in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-two undergraduates sat in a cubicle and read a technical text about migraines for six minutes, before reporting what they remembered, answering questions on the text, and finally completing a questionnaire about their misophonia sensitivity (they rated how distressing they found sounds like “rustling papers, sneezing, chewing gum, tapping, eating crunchy foods, and heavy breathing”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;For half the participants, a nearby cubicle contained a confederate working for the researchers who chewed gum loudly throughout the experiment. Participants in this condition who scored higher on the misophonia questionnaire performed worse at the comprehension measures than lower scorers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the reverse pattern was found for the participants in the quiet control condition, with the more sound-sensitive students performing slightly better – perhaps because these conditions were the ones in which they naturally thrive. So misophonia seems to have an impact in non-clinical contexts (none of the rating scores reached clinical levels of sensitivity), although we can’t say whether its origin is in a subtle neurological difference or a psychological preoccupation. But it’s a good reminder that by honouring the expectations in designated quiet spaces, we may be helping others more than we know.&lt;/p&gt;

Although it was to prove less destructive than the 1918 influenza pandemic which occured at around the same time, the new outbreak had a persistent legacy: some of the victims of the disease remained disabled decades later.

&lt;p&gt;Do you think you are closer to your “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/22/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-true-self-but-its-still-a-useful-psychological-concept/&quot;&gt;true self&lt;/a&gt;” today than in the past? If so, is this a work in progress? Will the you of the future be even more authentic than you are today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of US psychologists recently put these kind of questions to over 250 volunteers across two studies, to find out if there is a general pattern in the way that we think about the development of our true selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting their findings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1322530&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Seto and Rebecca Schlegel found there is a tendency for us to see ourselves as becoming progressively more authentic through life. “If these reflections are at all reflective of how people feel in real time,” they concluded, “it is possible that people believe they will be the closest they have ever been to who they really are when they reach the end of their lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33692&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seto and Schlegel started out by looking at the near past, present and future. They gave 125 students (mostly 18 to 19-year-olds) a definition of the true self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your TRUE SELF is made up of the characteristics, roles, or attributes that define who you really are – even if those characteristics are different than how you sometimes act in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they asked the students to indicate how much overlap there was between their true self and their self when they graduated high school, their self today, and their self as they will be at the end of the current semester. There was a clear trend for the students to see themselves as currently closer to their true self than they were in the past, and for this closeness to their true self to increase further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, the researchers asked 134 participants recruited online (a wider age range this time of 19 to 67) to divide their entire lives – past, present and future – into chapters, to write a description for each chapter, and to rate how close their self in each chapter was to their “true self”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there was a clear trend for people to see their authenticity as having increased through time, and to expect it to progress further in the future (although there was a tapering effect, so that the largest increases in authenticity were seen in the near past, and in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seto and Schlegel said this pattern of findings is consistent with what would be expected based on the psychology of self-enhancement: this is usual our motivation – well-established by prior research – to see our current selves in a positive light, including by derogating our past selves. Most of us also tend to be unrealistically optimistic, thinking that we and life will only get better in the future. Consistent with this, the participants ratings for their happiness and meaning for each life chapter showed a similar rising trend across the lifespan. Also, higher participant self-esteem correlated with expecting to increase more in authenticity over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the findings generally didn’t tie in with what Harvard psychologists termed the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/01/14/the-end-of-history-illusion-illusion/&quot;&gt;End of History Illusion&lt;/a&gt;” five years ago, based on their finding that most of us think we’ve changed a lot in the past, but that we don’t expect to keep changing so much in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately what the new findings can’t do is answer what the researchers admit is “the most interesting question” – how people’s sense of authenticity really does vary through life. The new results suggest that overall people – at least in American culture – &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they’ve become progressively more “real”, and they expect this to continue.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a couple of minutes, click through to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/vEARsurvey&quot;&gt;survey site&lt;/a&gt; of “noisy gifs” – brief silent movies that, for some people at least, evoke illusory sounds. If you hear a thwack when fists collide with a punchbag, or a yell while watching a man silently scream, then you’re experiencing a “visual-evoked auditory response” (vEAR), also called “hearing motion synaesthesia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after the first, preliminary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18682202&quot;&gt;journal paper&lt;/a&gt; on the phenomenon, Christopher Fassnidge and Elliot Freeman at City University, London, report – in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218300741?via=ihub&quot;&gt;paper&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cortex&lt;/i&gt; – that it’s remarkably common, affecting perhaps 20 – 30 per cent of us. Fassnidge and Freeman also investigated what induces vEAR, providing clues to what’s going on in the brain.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33688&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4,000 volunteers, plus 126 paid participants, viewed 24, 5-second-long silent videos of real world scenarios and also more abstract images, such as shifting patterns. Using a scale of 0 to 5, they indicated how much auditory sensation they experienced for each video. They also answered a series of other questions, including about past experience of vEAR and of any other synaesthesias (when a perception via one sensory modality triggers a sensory perception in another modality).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the unpaid volunteers were recruited via adverts with text such as “Do you experience ‘hearing motion?’”, it’s certainly possible that there was a self-selection bias. But, on enrolment, the paid participants did not know what the study was about, so, in theory, they should be more representative of the general population. Thirty-one per cent of this paid group (an even higher percentage, in fact, than in the bigger, unpaid group) reported past experience of vEAR.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the survey results, anyone who rated half of the videos at greater than or equal to 3 was identified as experiencing vEAR. Just over 20 per cent of the paid participants fell into this category. Taken with the self reports of past experience of vEAR, the findings suggest that the phenomenon is far from rare.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher-rated videos often depicted relatively familiar events that are reliably associated with particular sounds (like fists hitting a punchbag), suggesting that an understanding of what’s happening in the scene was involved in causing the illusory sounds. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in people who reported prior experience of vEAR, even videos containing abstract flickering or moving patterns could trigger sound perceptions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fassnidge and Freeman found that these videos had high levels of raw “motion energy” (imagine a flickering neon shop sign, for instance, compared with a silent video of a person screaming, in which case there’s very little movement or “motion energy”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specific sensitivity to motion energy suggests, the researchers write, that in some people, at least, visual motion – rather than the meaning of a scene – affects auditory perceptions directly. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that participants with prior experience of vEAR were also more likely to report other synaesthesias, including seeing flashes in reaction to hearing sudden sounds in the dark, it’s possible the two phenomena are related. Synaesthesia has been associated with higher than normal cortical “excitability”, for instance, and the researchers said cortical excitability might also be involved in vEAR. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that could now be investigated, the researchers write, before concluding: “Given the prevalence of visual-evoked auditory sensations and our new ability to quantify and correlate them, a potentially broad class of related subjective audiovisual phenomena have now become more accessible to scientific study.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To punch holes in a scientific claim, it’s legitimate to critique the supporting evidence, or query the way the evidence has been interpreted. More questionable is to throw dirt on the character or capability of the researcher making the claim. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192025&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One &lt;/i&gt;explores&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the effectiveness of ad hominem attacks against scientists and shows that some are more damaging than others.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33675&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Barnes of Montana State University and his team asked around 500 undergraduate students to review a number of scientific claims, each attributed to a named researcher, such as “Dr Martinez”. The claims were either obscure or invented, to avoid hot-button issues where the participants might already have strong immovable views (e.g. “According to Dr. Martinez at the University of Oklahoma, dibutylphthalate, a chemical used in Gold Bond foot powder, decreases the risk of some kinds of cancer”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the claims came with additional information that was either neutral (it didn’t challenge the claim) or that critiqued the researcher (ad hominem attacks) or the science behind his or her claim (e.g. pointing out issues with the supporting study itself, like the lack of a control group).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad hominem attacks either referred to past misconduct, like fabrication of previous data, conflict of interest (e.g. financed by a drug company with interests in the finding), education (e.g. low standards at the university from which he got a degree), or reports of sloppiness from his or her peers. One final type of criticism pointed at both the researcher and the study, for example an investigation that suggested he or she had fabricated this particular dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated how much faith they held in each scientific claim. Ad hominems involving education and sloppiness did not sway participants from the default level of support that they showed when the claim was presented without criticism. But a conflict of interest or past misconduct lowered faith in the claim just as much as hearing about faults in the research supporting the claim.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, personal allegations of vested interest or past misconduct were just as damning as hearing that the researcher was implicated specifically in falsifying &lt;i&gt;the very&lt;/i&gt; research that supported the claim they were making. It seems that participants could forgive suggestions that a researcher was not top-notch, but suspicions about their past motives and integrity were sufficient to pour cold water on their claims. This pattern was replicated in a sample of around 200 non-students with a wider age range (23-83, mean 49 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One criticism of the new findings is the abstract measure of participants’ faith in the claims (rather asking whether they would act on the claims, for instance). But previous use of the same paradigm has shown that this measure predicts more concrete intentions, like which of two prescription drugs a participant says they would personally use. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an ad hominem attack is considered a logical fallacy, the participants’ reactions in the new research are not strictly speaking illogical: if someone has cheated in the past, it may be reasonable for that to colour your view of their current work. Barnes and his team expected that this would especially be the case when the allegations of bad behaviour pertained specifically to the evidence underlying a researcher’s claims – but in fact the findings suggest that any allegations of past bad behavior, whether directly relevant or not, made a researcher’s claims appear equally suspect.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong effect of the conflict of interest ad hominem is also worth noting. It’s reasonably easy for critics to allege or imply a conflict of interest, especially for those willing to entertain a conspiratorial perspective. This may explain why groups hostile to scientific developments, such as vaccination, put such weight on these issues – because it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192025&quot;&gt;The effect of ad hominem attacks on the evaluation of claims promoted by scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
