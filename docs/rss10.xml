&lt;p&gt;While the idea that the lack of women in science and tech is &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; about cultural obstacles is contentious (as &lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2017/08/07/google-memo-four-scientists-respond/&quot;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/no-the-google-manifesto-isnt-sexist-or-anti-diversity-its-science/article35903359/&quot;&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; the recent Google memo furore), few would argue that social and cultural factors aren’t important. And these social influences may begin early. For example there’s an argument that boys are encouraged to play with toys that are likely to promote skills that will help them in science and maths. Toys aimed at girls, in contrast, are more likely to promote stereotypically feminine skills, such as nurturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEGO, say Megan Fulcher and Amy Hayes, the authors of a new paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sex Roles&lt;/em&gt;, is a case in point: its marketing is skewed towards boys, especially since the increase in packaged sets, which tend to feature stereotypically masculine items like pirate ships and castles. The result, they argue, is that boys are more attracted to LEGO, girls deterred from it, and that boys get to practice their building skills while girls don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEGO has heard some of this criticism (and no doubt also seen a gap in the market) and they’ve released girl-friendly packaged sets and product lines, including &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; items with a focus on people and including pink bricks. But Fulcher and Hayes – who very much speak from the nurture perspective on these issues (they fail to cite a single study demonstrating a biological basis for sex differences in toy preference) – fear this could be counterproductive because girlie bricks and sets are likely to promote more stereotypically feminine LEGO play and remind girls of their gender. To find out if their concerns are justified the researchers tested the LEGO building skills and choices of 116 girls and boys (aged 5 to 10) depending on whether they were given boyish LEGO bricks and packages or girlie ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-28339&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first phase of the study, the boys and girls were randomly assigned to follow instructions to build either a stereotypically male design (a dinosaur) or a female design (a cat). Also, whatever object they were trying to build, half were given boyish bricks to use (blue/green), and half were given girlie bricks (pink purple).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulcher and Hayes predicted that girls would be slower and less accurate to build the LEGO when they were tasked with building the cat and/or when they were using girlie bricks (because these items would activate “typically gendered play scripts” and remind the girls that “there is a different kind of LEGO for you”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this wasn’t the case: the girls’ (and boys’) speed and accuracy was just the same regardless of what type of bricks they used. And girls and boys alike more quickly and accurately built the cat than the dinosaur, presumably because it was easier. However, whatever they were building, overall the boys were quicker at construction than the girls (with no accuracy tradeoff) and this remained the case even after factoring out experience with and interest in LEGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the study involved free play. Half the girls and half the boys were given girlie bricks (pink and white) to play with and build whatever they wanted, the other half were given boyish bricks (blue and grey). Each set also included wheels (supposedly boyish) and eyes (supposedly girlie). The children could take as long as they wanted and when they’d finished they were asked to say what they’d built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the boys built more stereotypically masculine objects than girls, such as water monsters and machine guns, they also incorporated wheels more into their designs than did the girls. This was as the researchers predicted since they believe that boys are not affected by any relevant cultural stereotypes or expectations that might be triggered by the different bricks. However, the researchers predicted that girls given pink bricks would be reminded of their gender and so build more girlie objects with these bricks, and that’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulcher and Hayes believe this shows that while “more girl-targeted and ‘girl’-colour LEGO sets” may help attract more girls to play with LEGO, they do so at the cost of “restricting the kinds of structures and play with which they engage”. However, remembering the null effects in the first study phase, it seems they found only limited evidence to back up their concerns. And these are concerns which currently depend on a good deal of speculation – for instance, the new study doesn’t provide any direct evidence that it is at all harmful that girls are more likely to build stereotypically feminine objects with pink bricks. It also seemed an omission not to measure the boys’ and girls’ enjoyment. If girls prefer playing with girl-targeted LEGO more than other kinds, isn’t that also an important part of the equation?&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The secret to a long life could be the right job (at least for ants)</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/08/09/the-secret-to-a-long-life-is-down-to-your-job-for-ants/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociality favours the adjustment to ecological niches and facilitates the spread of a species. Group living is therefore widespread, from insects to mammals, but differs in the degree of cooperation and altruism. In subsocial species (e.g. giant water bugs, several spiders or fish), the parents stay with their offspring for some time until the latter start to reproduce independently. In cooperatively breeding birds (e.g. Southern Ground-Hornbill) or mammals (e.g. mongooses), sociality reaches a higher level with older siblings or other group members helping to raise offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest form of social cooperation is eusociality, which is rare in mammals (only naked-mole rats), but abundant in two insect orders: Hymenoptera (e.g. bees, wasps, ants) and Blattodea (termites). The intense cooperation between individuals in these species might be the cause of the evolutionary and ecological success of eusocial insects, which can make up to 75% of a habitat’s animal biomass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The organisation of eusocial insect colonies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, colonies of eusocial Hymenoptera consist of overlapping generations of related, female individuals, whereas males are often only produced seasonally for mating. Most females, the “workers”, refrain from reproduction or are completely sterile. They care for other colony members and the brood, supply them with food, and maintain or defend the nest. In many species these tasks are distributed by age: the younger workers conduct work within the nest, while the older ones take over the risky tasks outside the nest. The reproductive queens do not participate in such non-reproductive tasks but are responsible for the production of new offspring. They often differ from the workers in body size and morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9393&quot; style=&quot;width: 4618px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9393&quot; height=&quot;3052&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;4608&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A winged virgin queen and a wingless mated queen of the ant &lt;em&gt;Cardiocondyla obscurior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Julia Giehr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness of insect societies mainly depends on the efficiency of interactions between reproductives and helpers, as the reproductive task is not exchangeable in many species. This makes ants a suitable model organism to study the interrelations between individual and group characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpredictable social or environmental changes, like, e.g., destruction of the nest, might afford adaptions regarding the task allocations. Ants of our study species &lt;em&gt;Cardiocondyla obscurior&lt;/em&gt; found new nests via budding, which means that a few individuals – e.g. workers, together with brood and queen(s) – leave the maternal nest to initiate a new colony. In this case, workers might have to react flexibly to new conditions and possibly have to switch from outer to inner nest tasks and vice versa. Although studies in bees and ants have confirmed a flexible task allocation, its effect on the performance and survival of individuals has rarely been studied. In our study we wanted to test whether a forced task shift has an effect on colony growth and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our experimental set-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we created new colonies that consisted of only young (freshly eclosed) or only old (12 weeks old) workers, together with either a single young or old queen. This setup forced a part of the young workers to leave the nest precociously to forage, while several old workers had to revert from foraging to brood care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then examined the effect of queen and worker age on colony growth and task performance by estimating the number of produced brood and offspring and its quality (weight) during a complete colony lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9395&quot; style=&quot;width: 4618px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9395&quot; height=&quot;3052&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;4608&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Mated &lt;em&gt;Cardiocondyla obscurior&lt;/em&gt; queen (left) together with brood items and one worker (right)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Julia Giehr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experiment showed that colonies perform much better when queens and workers are of similar age. Task performance of a worker did not mainly depend on its chronological age but on group composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, lifespan appears to be a very plastic trait in ants and is strongly affected by colony demography. The event of colony founding seems to reset the age of the workers and indicates that chronological and physiological age are not necessarily linked. Twelve-week old workers that were exposed to the condition of a newly founded nest with a new queen and without brood outlived workers that eclosed in the same situation by several weeks. A similar effect of social environment was also observed in queens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why observe ageing in ants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging and senescence are ubiquitous phenomena throughout multicellular life and have fascinated humanity for centuries. Although many studies have focussed on the mechanisms underlying aging, its proximate and ultimate causes are still not completely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ant &lt;em&gt;Cardiocondyla obscurior&lt;/em&gt; provides an ideal model organism for ageing in social insects&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It appears that the lifespan of workers is more affected by colony stage and demography than by chronological age and that workers do not suffer strongly from an age-related decline of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, queens of this species not only outlive their conspecific sterile nestmates (workers) by weeks, despite sharing the same genome, but in contrast to other animals they also do not suffer from reduced survival after an increased investment in reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative senescence and the effects on physiological age still raise many questions. This is why our team at the University of Regensburg, together with colleagues in a DFG-funded research unit (“Sociality and the reversal of the fecundity-longevity trade-off,” FOR 2281), focuses on reproduction and ageing in social insect queens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the drivers of a psychopathic personality (marked by callousness, disinhibition and superficial charm), it’s worth looking at our closest relatives. Some chimps, like some people, score highly on scales designed to evaluate psychopathic tendencies. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2017.00407/full&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience &lt;/i&gt;reveals a potentially important genetic contributor to psychopathic traits&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in chimps, which could lead to a better understanding of the traits in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-28322&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team led by Robert Latzman at Georgia State University studied 164 chimpanzees housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia and the National Center for Chimpanzee Care at the University of Texas. Each chimpanzee was rated by typically two to three colony staff members, who knew the individual animals, on the “CHMP-Tri scales” (a kind of chimp personality questionnaire that assesses their boldness, meanness and disinhibition – the three traits that form the so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19583890&quot;&gt;triarchic model” of psychopathy&lt;/a&gt;). They also sequenced the AVPR1A regions of the chimps’ genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latzman and his team decided to home in on this gene because it codes for a receptor for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin&quot;&gt;vasopressin&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropeptide known to play a role in complex social behaviours in humans and other animals, and so, in theory, relates to psychopathy. Vasopressin levels have been found to correlate with a history of aggression in people with various personality disorders. And polymorphisms (variations) in a region of the AVPR1A gene have been associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12119/full&quot;&gt;variability in a number of traits relevant for psychopathy&lt;/a&gt;, including increased novelty-seeking and decreased avoidance of harm in people, and also to personality in chimps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also considered each chimp’s gender (as there are sex differences in the vasopressin system) and also, given extensive work finding that genes can interact with early life experience to influence behaviour, whether each animal had been reared by its own mother (119 had been) or, because of maternal neglect, or illness or injury, the chimp had been reared, for its own wellbeing, from a very early age by people (59 fell into this category).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chimps reared by their own mothers, whether they had a common polymorphism in a key region of AVPR1A was correlated with their score on disinhibition. Variations in the AVPR1A gene also correlated with scores for boldness, and the animals’ total psychopathy scores. But for chimps reared by people, there was no relationship between their AVPR1A genotype and their CHMP-Tri scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the team didn’t directly measure vasopressin levels, the results are consistent with the idea that genetically determined levels of vasopressin contribute to psychopathic tendencies, and  “provide additional compelling evidence that psychopathic tendencies are rooted in basic, evolutionarily-meaningful dispositions,” the team writes. The results also, of course, show an important role for the environmental factor of rearing experience (perhaps roughly equivalent to parenting or foster care experiences for children).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to know more about the interaction between early care-giver experiences and the heritability of psychopathy. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://latzmanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Latzman-et-al-in-press-Etiology-of-Triarchic-Psychopathy-Dimensions-in-Chimpanzees.pdf&quot;&gt;another paper &lt;/a&gt;published this year by some of the authors of the current research and others, nursery-reared chimps scored significantly higher on the measure of disinhibition than those reared by their own mothers, though there was no relationship between rearing environment and either boldness or meanness. Might the higher disinhibition scores among the nursery-reared animals overwhelm, then, any effect of variations in AVPR1A (thus explaining why the gene was unrelated to psychopathic traits in nursery-reared chimps in the current research)? Or is something else going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US National Institutes of Health has scaled back some studies involving chimpanzees. But Latzman and his colleagues argue that ethically sound and scientifically justifiable studies could (alongside studies of people) provide valuable insights into biological and behavioural processes relevant not just to psychopathy but to psychological illness more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: New evidence for mammaliaform ear evolution and feeding adaptation in a Jurassic ecosystem</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/551RoyDy8Q0/nature23483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Stem mammaliaforms are forerunners to modern mammals, and they achieved considerable ecomorphological diversity in their own right. Recent discoveries suggest that eleutherodontids, a subclade of Haramiyida, were more species-rich during the Jurassic period in Asia than previously recognized. Here we report a new Jurassic eleutherodontid mammaliaform with an unusual mosaic of highly specialized characteristics, and the results of phylogenetic analyses that support the hypothesis that haramiyidans are stem mammaliaforms. The new fossil shows fossilized skin membranes that are interpreted to be for gliding and a mandibular middle ear with a unique character combination previously unknown in mammaliaforms. Incisor replacement is prolonged until well after molars are fully erupted, a timing pattern unique to most other mammaliaforms. In situ molar occlusion and a functional analysis reveal a new mode of dental occlusion: dual mortar–pestle occlusion of opposing upper and lower molars, probably for dual crushing and grinding. This suggests that eleutherodontids are herbivorous, and probably specialized for granivory or feeding on soft plant tissues. The inferred dietary adaptation of eleutherodontid gliders represents a remarkable evolutionary convergence with herbivorous gliders in Theria. These Jurassic fossils represent volant, herbivorous stem mammaliaforms associated with pre-angiosperm plants that appear long before the later, iterative associations between angiosperm plants and volant herbivores in various therian clades.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Stem mammaliaforms are Mesozoic forerunners to mammals, and they offer critical evidence for the anatomical evolution and ecological diversification during the earliest mammalian history. Two new eleutherodonts from the Late Jurassic period have skin membranes and skeletal features that are adapted for gliding. Characteristics of their digits provide evidence of roosting behaviour, as in dermopterans and bats, and their feet have a calcaneal calcar to support the uropagatium as in bats. The new volant taxa are phylogenetically nested with arboreal eleutherodonts. Together, they show an evolutionary experimentation similar to the iterative evolutions of gliders within arboreal groups of marsupial and placental mammals. However, gliding eleutherodonts possess rigid interclavicle–clavicle structures, convergent to the avian furculum, and they retain shoulder girdle plesiomorphies of mammaliaforms and monotremes. Forelimb mobility required by gliding occurs at the acromion–clavicle and glenohumeral joints, is different from and convergent to the shoulder mobility at the pivotal clavicle–sternal joint in marsupial and placental gliders.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: New infant cranium from the African Miocene sheds light on ape evolution</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/IGtWNCCjupU/nature23456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The evolutionary history of extant hominoids (humans and apes) remains poorly understood. The African fossil record during the crucial time period, the Miocene epoch, largely comprises isolated jaws and teeth, and little is known about ape cranial evolution. Here we report on the, to our knowledge, most complete fossil ape cranium yet described, recovered from the 13 million-year-old Middle Miocene site of Napudet, Kenya. The infant specimen, KNM-NP 59050, is assigned to a new species of Nyanzapithecus on the basis of its unerupted permanent teeth, visualized by synchrotron imaging. Its ear canal has a fully ossified tubular ectotympanic, a derived feature linking the species with crown catarrhines. Although it resembles some hylobatids in aspects of its morphology and dental development, it possesses no definitive hylobatid synapomorphies. The combined evidence suggests that nyanzapithecines were stem hominoids close to the origin of extant apes, and that hylobatid-like facial features evolved multiple times during catarrhine evolution.

 Associating stimuli with positive or negative reinforcement is essential for survival, but a complete wiring diagram of a higher-order circuit supporting associative memory has not been previously available. Here we reconstruct one such circuit at synaptic resolution, the Drosophila larval mushroom body. We find that most Kenyon cells integrate random combinations of inputs but that a subset receives stereotyped inputs from single projection neurons. This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections found between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned behaviours. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future functional studies of this learning and memory centre.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: An early modern human presence in Sumatra 73,000–63,000 years ago</title>

 Genetic evidence for anatomically modern humans (AMH) out of Africa before 75 thousand years ago (ka) and in island southeast Asia (ISEA) before 60 ka (93–61 ka) predates accepted archaeological records of occupation in the region. Claims that AMH arrived in ISEA before 60 ka (ref. 4) have been supported only by equivocal or non-skeletal evidence. AMH evidence from this period is rare and lacks robust chronologies owing to a lack of direct dating applications, poor preservation and/or excavation strategies and questionable taxonomic identifications. Lida Ajer is a Sumatran Pleistocene cave with a rich rainforest fauna associated with fossil human teeth. The importance of the site is unclear owing to unsupported taxonomic identification of these fossils and uncertainties regarding the age of the deposit, therefore it is rarely considered in models of human dispersal. Here we reinvestigate Lida Ajer to identify the teeth confidently and establish a robust chronology using an integrated dating approach. Using enamel–dentine junction morphology, enamel thickness and comparative morphology, we show that the teeth are unequivocally AMH. Luminescence and uranium-series techniques applied to bone-bearing sediments and speleothems, and coupled uranium-series and electron spin resonance dating of mammalian teeth, place modern humans in Sumatra between 73 and 63 ka. This age is consistent with biostratigraphic estimations, palaeoclimate and sea-level reconstructions, and genetic evidence for a pre-60 ka arrival of AMH into ISEA. Lida Ajer represents, to our knowledge, the earliest evidence of rainforest occupation by AMH, and underscores the importance of reassessing the timing and environmental context of the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: m6A mRNA methylation controls T cell homeostasis by targeting the IL-7/STAT5/SOCS pathways</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/OdZ1lkG1a40/nature23450</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant messenger RNA modification, modulated by ‘writers’, ‘erasers’ and ‘readers’ of this mark. In vitro data have shown that m6A influences all fundamental aspects of mRNA metabolism, mainly mRNA stability, to determine stem cell fates. However, its in vivo physiological function in mammals and adult mammalian cells is still unknown. Here we show that the deletion of m6A ‘writer’ protein METTL3 in mouse T cells disrupts T cell homeostasis and differentiation. In a lymphopaenic mouse adoptive transfer model, naive Mettl3-deficient T cells failed to undergo homeostatic expansion and remained in the naive state for up to 12 weeks, thereby preventing colitis. Consistent with these observations, the mRNAs of SOCS family genes encoding the STAT signalling inhibitory proteins SOCS1, SOCS3 and CISH were marked by m6A, exhibited slower mRNA decay and showed increased mRNAs and levels of protein expression in Mettl3-deficient naive T cells. This increased SOCS family activity consequently inhibited IL-7-mediated STAT5 activation and T cell homeostatic proliferation and differentiation. We also found that m6A has important roles for inducible degradation of Socs mRNAs in response to IL-7 signalling in order to reprogram naive T cells for proliferation and differentiation. Our study elucidates for the first time, to our knowledge, the in vivo biological role of m6A modification in T-cell-mediated pathogenesis and reveals a novel mechanism of T cell homeostasis and signal-dependent induction of mRNA degradation.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structural insights into ligand recognition by the lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPA6</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/9uCrCzBQshk/nature23448</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid composed of a phosphate group, a glycerol backbone, and a single acyl chain that varies in length and saturation. LPA activates six class A G-protein-coupled receptors to provoke various cellular reactions. Because LPA signalling has been implicated in cancer and fibrosis, the LPA receptors are regarded as promising drug targets. The six LPA receptors are subdivided into the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (LPA1–LPA3) and the phylogenetically distant non-EDG family (LPA4–LPA6). The structure of LPA1 has enhanced our understanding of the EDG family of LPA receptors. By contrast, the functional and pharmacological characteristics of the non-EDG family of LPA receptors have remained unknown, owing to the lack of structural information. Although the non-EDG LPA receptors share sequence similarity with the P2Y family of nucleotide receptors, the LPA recognition mechanism cannot be deduced from the P2Y1 and P2Y12 structures because of the large differences in the chemical structures of their ligands. Here we determine the 3.2 Å crystal structure of LPA6, the gene deletion of which is responsible for congenital hair loss, to clarify the ligand recognition mechanism of the non-EDG family of LPA receptors. Notably, the ligand-binding pocket of LPA6 is laterally open towards the membrane, and the acyl chain of the lipid used for the crystallization is bound within this pocket, indicating the binding mode of the LPA acyl chain. Docking and mutagenesis analyses also indicated that the conserved positively charged residues within the central cavity recognize the phosphate head group of LPA by inducing an inward shift of transmembrane helices 6 and 7, suggesting that the receptor activation is triggered by this conformational rearrangement.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: mRNA 3′ uridylation and poly(A) tail length sculpt the mammalian maternal transcriptome</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/DHPZF5bzSEY/nature23318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 A fundamental principle in biology is that the program for early development is established during oogenesis in the form of the maternal transcriptome. How the maternal transcriptome acquires the appropriate content and dosage of transcripts is not fully understood. Here we show that 3′ terminal uridylation of mRNA mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 sculpts the mouse maternal transcriptome by eliminating transcripts during oocyte growth. Uridylation mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 is essential for both oocyte maturation and fertility. In comparison to somatic cells, the oocyte transcriptome has a shorter poly(A) tail and a higher relative proportion of terminal oligo-uridylation. Deletion of TUT4 and TUT7 leads to the accumulation of a cohort of transcripts with a high frequency of very short poly(A) tails, and a loss of 3′ oligo-uridylation. By contrast, deficiency of TUT4 and TUT7 does not alter gene expression in a variety of somatic cells. In summary, we show that poly(A) tail length and 3′ terminal uridylation have essential and specific functions in shaping a functional maternal transcriptome.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Rewiring the taste system</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/R8mejN8lWIs/nature23299</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In mammals, taste buds typically contain 50–100 tightly packed taste-receptor cells (TRCs), representing all five basic qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. Notably, mature taste cells have life spans of only 5–20 days and, consequently, are constantly replenished by differentiation of taste stem cells. Given the importance of establishing and maintaining appropriate connectivity between TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons (that is, ensuring that a labelled line from sweet TRCs connects to sweet neurons, bitter TRCs to bitter neurons, sour to sour, and so on), we examined how new connections are specified to retain fidelity of signal transmission. Here we show that bitter and sweet TRCs provide instructive signals to bitter and sweet target neurons via different guidance molecules (SEMA3A and SEMA7A). We demonstrate that targeted expression of SEMA3A or SEMA7A in different classes of TRCs produces peripheral taste systems with miswired sweet or bitter cells. Indeed, we engineered mice with bitter neurons that now responded to sweet tastants, sweet neurons that responded to bitter or sweet neurons responding to sour stimuli. Together, these results uncover the basic logic of the wiring of the taste system at the periphery, and illustrate how a labelled-line sensory circuit preserves signalling integrity despite rapid and stochastic turnover of receptor cells.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Global patterns of drought recovery</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/KV7Hef0xsVs/nature23021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Drought, a recurring phenomenon with major impacts on both human and natural systems, is the most widespread climatic extreme that negatively affects the land carbon sink. Although twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, across many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in the twenty-first century. Recovery time—how long an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre-drought functional state—is a critical metric of drought impact. Yet the factors influencing drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the global scale are largely unknown. Here we analyse three independent datasets of gross primary productivity and show that, across diverse ecosystems, drought recovery times are strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics, with biodiversity and CO2 fertilization as secondary factors. Our analysis also provides two key insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of drought recovery time: first, that recovery is longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes (both vulnerable areas of Earth’s climate system) and second, that drought impacts (assessed using the area of ecosystems actively recovering and time to recovery) have increased over the twentieth century. If droughts become more frequent, as expected, the time between droughts may become shorter than drought recovery time, leading to permanently damaged ecosystems and widespread degradation of the land carbon sink.

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of pairs of terms in psychology that sound as if they refer to the same thing, and can therefore be used interchangeably, when in fact they refer to different concepts that are distinct in important ways. As Emory University professor Scott Lilienfeld and his colleagues point out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2017.00037/full&quot;&gt;their new open-access paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Education&lt;/em&gt;, even experienced psychologists and science communicators sometimes confuse these pairs of terms, which inevitably impedes their understanding of the underlying concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their new paper outlines 50 “frequently confused term pairs in psychology” from across different fields of psychology and related subjects. “Our list … should hopefully be a modest contribution toward enhancing psychological literacy and critical thinking in psychology more broadly,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we’ve highlighted 10 of the pairs of psychology terms that Lilienfeld and his co-authors believe you might be getting confused (check &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2017.00037/full&quot;&gt;the full paper&lt;/a&gt; for the other 40):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-28108&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Negative Reinforcement” versus “Punishment”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A few years ago &lt;em&gt;ABC news&lt;/em&gt; reported “&lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=80629&quot;&gt;British Soccer Players Get Negative Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;“. The story was about the players who’d played badly being made to drive around in an old, uncool car. But this wasn’t negative reinforcement, it was a punishment: an unpleasant experience intended to deter future bad play. Negative reinforcement, by contrast, is a reward in the form of the removal of a previously unpleasant stimulus or experience, thus increasing the likelihood of the behaviour that preceded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Envy” versus “Jealousy”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of us use these terms interchangeably not realising that envy is specifically about the dynamics between two people whereas jealousy involves three or more. A leading researcher in this area is psychologist Richard Smith. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/joy-and-pain/201401/what-is-the-difference-between-envy-and-jealousy&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/em&gt;: “Envy occurs when we lack a desired attribute enjoyed by another” whereas “Jealousy occurs when something we already possess (usually a special relationship) is threatened by a third person”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Antisocial” versus “Asocial”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Both sound very similar if we’re not paying attention. The clue of course is that the prefix “anti” means against, where as the prefix “a” means without. In psychology, anti-social is often used in the context of antisocial personality disorder, which describes a person who behaves against others, engaging “in reckless, irresponsible, and at times illegal behaviours” (to quote Lilenfeld et al). By contrast, an asocial person is “shy or disinterested in interpersonal contact”. Lilienfeld and his coauthors give the example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/09/01/introvert-myths_n_3569058.html&quot;&gt;a Huffington Post article&lt;/a&gt; that conflated this distinction, stating: “the idea that introverts are antisocial or don’t want the company of others is completely false”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Obsession” versus “Compulsion”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Easy to confuse, but in terms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, obsessions are anxiety-generating repetitive thoughts, urges or images (e.g. “I feel dirty”, “I’ve been contaminated”), whereas compulsions are the behaviours or mental acts that the person performs to try to reduce their anxiety (e.g. hand washing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Psychopathy” vs. “Sociopathy”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You might have heard an unpleasant character described as a sociopath and wondered if that’s the same or different from a psychopath. At least in the context of clinical and forensic psychology, Lilienfeld et al explain that a psychopathic personality is defined by a specific mix of features including superficial charm and callousness. Sociopathy on the other hand is not a formal or technical term, and it’s used to mean different things by different people, for example as a synonym for psychopath or to describe someone with a long history of criminal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Serial killer” versus “Mass murderer”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While we’re on the subject of criminal characters, Lilienfeld et al also highlight an important distinction in forensic psychology between types of murderer: Serial killers (e.g. Peter Sutcliffe AKA the Yorkshire Ripper) kill “multiple people in a string of incidents that are separated by ‘cooling off’ periods,” while mass murderers (e.g. Thomas Hamilton, the perpetrator of the mass shooting at a Dunblane school) massacre “a large number of people in a single incident”. For completeness, Lilienfeld’s team add that spree killers form another group: like serial killers, they kill multiple people in separate incidents, but unlike serial killers their “homicidal episodes are not separated by clear-cut cooling-off periods”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mediator” versus “Moderator”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From types of killer to statistical nuance. As Lilienfeld at al explain, “A mediator is a variable, C, that intervenes between two correlated variables A and B, and that accounts at least in part … or entirely … for their statistical association.” Mediators speak to the why of an association. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/20/how-michael-jacksons-heal-the-world-really-could-help-heal-the-world/&quot;&gt;a 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; found that listening to prosocial songs like Michael Jackson’s Heal the World was associated with lower aggression and that this seemed to be partly mediated by the effect of the song on listeners’ mood rather than on their thoughts. A moderator, by contrast, “is a variable, C, that statistically affects the direction, magnitude, or both, of the relation between variables A and B”. Lilienfeld et al give the example of the association between negative life events and severity of illness, which is stronger for uncontrollable events (e.g. death of a spouse) than more controllable ones (e.g. divorce). “Moderators tend to address ‘when’, ‘for whom’, and ‘under which’ questions,” Lilienfeld explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Prevalence” versus “Incidence”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What proportion of the population have a mental health diagnosis? The answer would tell you the prevalence of mental health problems. How many people are newly diagnosed with mental health problems in a given year (or other time period)? The answer to that question would tell you the incidence. “More technically,” explain Lilienfeld et al, “prevalence equals incidence multiplied by duration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Coma” versus “Persistent Vegetative State”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lilienfeld’s team place this one in their miscellaneous category. Coma and persistent vegetative state (PVS) are closely related, they explain, “but should be distinguished”. I covered misconceptions about these states and other disorders of consciousness at length &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;q=coma#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=coma&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;in my 2014 book &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;q=coma#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=coma&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Great Myths of the Brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;While coma and PVS are both&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;caused by brain damage and are associated with a lack of conscious awareness, there are important differences in the two states: Coma patients’ brains show no sign of a sleep wake cycle because of damage to the reticular system; in contrast PVS patients’ brains have an intact reticular system and show signs of a sleep wake cycle. Indeed, a PVS patient will usually have their eyes open during the wake part of the cycle (which can be confusing for loved ones and give false hope) and their eyes closed during the sleep phase. Also, coma patients are totally unresponsive whereas PVS patients often move and make sounds, and they may respond to noises and momentarily track moving targets with their eyes. Coma patients who survive but don’t wake up may progress to a PVS. If it is believed that a PVS patient has some rudimentary awareness, their diagnosis is changed to “minimally conscious state”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Relapse” versus “Recurrence”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To grasp the distinction between relapse and recurrence, it helps also to realise the difference between “remission” from a psychological disorder (a full improvement that has lasted at least four months after treatment) and “recovery” (full improvement that’s lasted more than a year). According to Lilienfeld and his colleagues, relapse is when a condition returns after the start of remission but before recovery. Recurrence, by contrast, is when the condition returns after recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: The challenge to define cortex (By Ashley Juavinett)</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/xtNlrUv1N_E/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/7030838119_f617dfcd3c_z-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our fragmentary and rapidly evolving understanding is reminiscent of the situation faced by cartographers of the earth’s surface many centuries ago, when maps were replete with uncertainties and divergent portrayals of most of the planet’s surface.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– David Van Essen, 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love talking about cortex. It’s bumpy, it’s got layers, and it’s probably the brain structure that makes us the very verbal, skilled primates that we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also love all of the different areas of cortex—there’s one for face recognition, another for motion detection, and many for decision-making. Often, labs stake claims on their cortical area of interest, diving deep into how that particular patch gets its job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how well can we really divvy up that important sheet of tissue that makes us human? Can we confidently say we’ve left one area, and moved into the next? And how well can we translate these borders to smaller animal models, such as mice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiny brains with big aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice are super important to neuroscientists. Sure, they’re quite small and not exactly the most brilliant animals, but we’ve been able to engineer them to mark specific cell types, express glowing proteins, and more. As a result of this powerful murine toolbox, mice have gained a lot of attention from scientists who want to understand circuits and cell types in the brain. In particular, the &lt;em&gt;visual cortex&lt;/em&gt; of the mouse has been the site of a lot of discussion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/neuroscience-through-the-eyes-of-a-mouse-1.13901&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;with many researchers&lt;/a&gt; hoping that we could use our extensive knowledge about the coarse organization of the primate visual system to ask detailed questions in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we want to use powerful genetic and recording tools in mice, we first need to understand how their cortex is organized. So, many neuroscientists have been working to combine textbook knowledge about primate brain organization with novel techniques designed for the tiny mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few landmark papers showing that mice have multiple visual areas like primates, the field immediately grabbed its two-photon microscopes and optical fibers and got to work. But as it turns out, mouse visual cortex isn’t &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; arranged like primate cortex, and many mouse researchers are left wondering if they have indeed isolated a meaningful cortical “area,” or a dubious patch of cortex. This challenge to disentangle the mouse brain has unearthed several fundamental questions about defining cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An age-old problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the new generation of mouse vision researchers, many before us have given careful thought to how we should consider the cortex. Primate researchers are quite familiar with the problem of defining cortical areas as well as the difficulties that arise when comparing across species. Multiple cortical partitioning schemes exist for macaque visual cortex and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730700774X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mapping these areas onto humans&lt;/a&gt; is quite contentious. In primates, there are 10-12 areas with clear organization, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainmap.wustl.edu/resources/VisChapter.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;there is anatomical and functional evidence for more than 40 distinct visual areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/Cortex_Jungle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-19413&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/Cortex_Jungle-249x300.png&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In an elegant book chapter on the topic, cortical map guru &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Van Essen&lt;/a&gt; lays out four ways to divide primate visual cortex: architecture, connectivity, retinotopy (an ordered map of the visual world), and functional specialization. Still, when we compare maps from these types of data they’re often conflicting, even in the relatively large primate brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usefully, Van Essen also defines three frequent problems encountered when defining a cortical area. First, there may be subtle (or imprecise) boundaries between areas, and therefore ground truth is not easily defined. Second, areas may be internally heterogeneous, either because they have repetitive structures, asymmetric organization, or gradients of function. Last, areas may differ between individual animals. Even in primates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6740964&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;primary visual cortex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2449473&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the middle temporal area&lt;/a&gt; can vary two-fold or more in size between monkeys. And while anatomical boundaries are often used to locate these areas in primates, these landmarks are quite variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current state of cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In the past year or so, multiple studies have been released that are challenging our current conceptions of mouse and human cortex. &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/18372&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research from the Allen Brain Institute&lt;/a&gt; suggests that mice have even more visual areas than we previously thought—something on the order of &lt;em&gt;sixteen&lt;/em&gt;. As in primates, many of these areas don’t clearly receive input from primary visual cortex, and some of them have really weak and/or partial maps of the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the research on human cortex is also getting a bit complicated. Using an enormous dataset from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Human Connectome Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7615/full/nature18933.html?foxtrotcallback=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Van Essen and his team identified 97 new cortical areas&lt;/a&gt;. That’s more than double the number of areas previously reported. They were able to do this by using multiple sources of information about organization, such as the thickness of cortex, or the activity in a given area during resting state. Like all good big data papers, they used machine learning to train a classifier to determine area boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these projects represent a new wave of approaches to integrate many types of data in order to accurately draw cortex area borders. Ultimately—as Van Essen himself once proposed—we may need to settle on probabilistic boundaries: area #1 &lt;em&gt;likely &lt;/em&gt;ends here, and area #2 is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;likely &lt;/em&gt;next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as it turns out, dividing up the cortex isn’t as simple as separating yellow and red M&amp;amp;Ms. However, with multiple types of anatomical and functional information across species, we’re hopefully moving towards a common framework for the widely-adored cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Opportunity for diversification: insights from species accumulation pattern in skipper butterflies</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/600px-Heteropterus.morpheus.2490-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of beetle species on earth is more than the number of plant species. The number of species in butterflies and moths are likely less than half of beetle species on earth. Beetles, butterflies and moths along with all other insect species represent almost half of all eukaryotic species. What governs such variation in species diversity – why are some groups of organisms species rich, while others are species poor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of species richness across different groups of organisms is broadly explained by the idea of ecological opportunity, which is based on two major components. First, evolution of a key character that provides the ability to utilize resources otherwise unavailable. Second, availability of the resources which can be facilitated through either extinction of competitive species or appearance of new resources or colonization to a new area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9355&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9355&quot; height=&quot;1040&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/800px-CogiaTyphedanus.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;This plate shows just a fraction of the species diversity within skipper butterflies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By investigating the pattern of associations of skipper butterflies and their larval hostplant, we show that the monocot-feeding skippers diversified much more rapidly than the dicot-feeding ones (monocot and dicot being the two major classes flowering plants are traditionally grouped in). As a result, the monocot-feeding group represents approximately equal number of species as that of the dicot-feeding group, although the monocot-feeding group originated more recently. However, different subgroups within the monocot-feeding group have diversified at different rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uncover the plausible reasons that could have influenced the differential rate of diversification within the monocot-feeding group, we compared the time when monocot-feeding skippers originated with the time of paleoclimatic events. We find that paleoclimatic events at distinct geological times have influenced diversification of monocot-feeding skippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9354&quot; style=&quot;width: 1290px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9354&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/1280px-Brown_longtail_Urbanus_procne_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A brown longtail, a member of the skipper family&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Anne Toal, CC2.0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, one subgroup of monocot-feeding skippers diversified on forest dwelling monocots when these plants themselves diversified owing to high atmospheric temperature around 50 million years ago. This diversification occurred in present day Africa, South Asia, and South-East Asia. Second, expansion of grasslands in South America around 40 million years ago facilitated diversification of another subgroup of monocot-feeding skippers which are broadly specialized on grasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, our comparative analyses reveal that the increased diversification of skipper butterflies is due to (i) evolution of the ability to feed on monocots, and (ii) subsequent availability of diverse monocot plants over a wide geographical area. Although we are not certain about the underlying mechanisms that would have facilitated diversification of grass feeding skippers, we predict that the geographical isolation mediated as a consequence of grassland expansion was a prominent factor.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Surgical management of cancer-related lymphedema</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/08/07/surgical-management-cancer-related-lymphedema/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/lymphedema-povoski-review-2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphedema represents a generalized buildup of extracellular lymph fluid within the soft tissues of arms and legs. This results from an imbalance in the amount of lymphatic fluid that is being produced and the amount of lymphatic fluid that is being cleared from lymphatic channels into the venous circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphedema is categorized as either primary lymphedema or secondary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema is a relatively rare condition and results from intrinsic structural or functional issues in the lymphatic drainage system secondary to abnormalities in the structure and/or function of the lymphatic channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary lymphedema is far more common and is the result of extrinsic disruption in lymphatic transport. In the more developed western world, this is most frequently caused by the traumatic surgical disruption of the normal lymphatic pathways. Cancer treatment, especially surgery and radiation therapy can result in the development of lymphedema. Breast cancer surgery is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in the arms. atients whose axillary lymph nodes are removed or irradiated as part of their therapy are at particularly high risk of developing this condition, which can arise years after surgery. Lymphedema in the legs is most commonly associated with gynecologic cancers, urologic cancers, melanoma, and lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphedema has a major impact on the quality of life of affected patients, both in terms of increased morbidity and significant psychological effects. The skin and soft tissues of the affected limb become progressively swollen, firm, and tight feeling due to the buildup of entrapped lymphatic fluids. The swelling can feel uncomfortable or even painful, and may make movements more difficult. Most seriously, this condition makes the affected limb much more prone to repeated and potentially life-threatening skin and soft tissue infections. Many patients eventually develop depression as a consequence of the impact that lymphedema has on their well-being and their physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; style=&quot;width: 368px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;http://media.springernature.com/lw785/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12885-017-3444-9/MediaObjects/12885_2017_3444_Fig4_HTML.gif&quot; width=&quot;358&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Certified lymphedema therapist performing circumference tape measurements on a patient with breast cancer related right upper extremity lymphedema&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no cure for lymphedema, which will affect patients for the rest of their lives. However, both non-surgical and surgical management strategies exist that attempt to reduce the buildup of extracellular lymph fluid within the affected limb and thus improve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main non-surgical management strategy, Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT), includes manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy, exercise and skin care as well as a range of motion, breathing and posture exercises, and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical management strategies include ablative surgical methods, which aim at removal of the tissues affected by lymphedema, and physiological surgical methods, which aim to recreate normal or alternate avenues for lymph fluid to flow out of the affected limb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablative surgical methods can be significantly invasive, and are directed towards the removal of the edematous superficial tissue layers of the affected limb. This includes the Charles procedure and suction-assisted lipectomy/liposuction. The Charles procedure represents a somewhat radical surgical procedure in which varying degrees of involved skin and subcutaneous tissue are excised from the affected limb, and can require coverage with skin grafts. Suction-assisted lipectomy/liposuction represents a much less invasive surgical procedure in which excess fat is removed from the affected limb using a suction cannula and liposuction device that is passed under the skin through multiple small incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiological surgical methods are directed towards reducing the lymphatic fluid burden in the affected limb by either improving lymphatic circulation by introducing healthy tissue into the affected limb or creating an alternate outflow pathway for lymph fluid. These methods require using sophisticated microsurgical and super-microsurgical techniques, to accomplish the physical reconnection of lymphatic channels to either small veins in the affected limb, or healthy lymphatic channels or tissues that can be harvested from other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While currently available surgical management strategies can result in dramatic improvement in symptoms and quality of life for patients, many formidable challenges remain for successful management of secondary lymphedema. It is hopeful that ongoing clinical research efforts will ultimately lead to more complete and sustainable treatment strategies and perhaps a cure for secondary lymphedema, its debilitating symptoms, and its potentially devastating resultant complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a paradox – the idea that participating in aggressive sport can make people less aggressive. Yet this belief forms a core basis of many martial arts dating back thousands of years, and many famous practitioners (real and fictional) have preached the importance of self control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legendary martial artist Bruce Lee once noted that “emotion can be the enemy. If you give into your emotion, you lose yourself”. Or as Mr Miyagi said in &lt;i&gt;The Karate Kid&lt;/i&gt; the “lesson is not just karate only, the lesson is for whole life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that this may well be the case, as participating in martial arts helps improve concentration and self-awareness, self-esteem, emotional stability and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it really true that martial arts also reduces aggression outside the dojo? Can participating in traditionally violent sports prove cathartic, helping young people develop self-discipline and in turn be less violent away from the sport? Writing in the journal of &lt;i&gt;Aggression and Violent Behaviour &lt;/i&gt;researchers from Israel and America report their findings from the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917300976?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;meta-analysis on the impact of martial arts on violent behaviours in children and teenagers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-28078&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Harwood and Michal Lavidor of Bar-Ilan University and Yuri Rassovsky of UCLA reviewed the existing research and found 300 potentially relevant papers. However, only twelve met their criteria for inclusion: they had to have a control group, as well as valid measures of the impact of martial arts on aggression, violence, anger or hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis found that participating in martial arts did indeed have a significant impact in reducing aggression. Of the twelve studies reviewed, eleven showed a positive impact. Central to this was that martial arts reduced the rate of externalising behaviours in participants. Externalising behaviours included, but were not limited to, physical aggression, verbal and physical bullying, theft and vandalism. Through the teaching and practices of martial arts, participants were better able to gain a sense of control over both the situations and themselves, leading to less negative emotional responses and violent behaviours.  Statistically speaking, the average size of the effect of martial arts on these behaviours was 0.65, indicating a medium sized effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were consistent regardless of the participants’ age or gender. Likewise, the amount of time spent training and if they practised their martial arts either in or outside of school made no significant difference. Given that the studies reviewed comprised a range of methodologies, including both longitudinal random control trials, these findings carry significant weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this meta-analysis was somewhat hampered by the sheer paucity of quality studies to have looked at the impact of martial arts on children and teenagers. As the authors put it, “the research on martial arts is sparse and many studies lack the statistical integrity to include them in a robust meta-analysis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many different martial arts and they all vary in their techniques and philosophy. Unfortunately, there has also been little research that has actively compared the impact that these different combat sports have on reducing aggression. This is because many of the studies to date have been on people who participate in a combination of martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one study in this review that did report a negative impact on martial arts on aggressive behavior was on young boys participating in judo. This finding may have been due to the lack of meditation within the training sessions to help improve self control, which is a common aspect of many other martial arts. Further research would help us identify under which situations and which martial arts are most beneficial for helping adolescents with aggressive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, this review raises some exciting implications for martial arts as an intervention for delinquent teenagers, especially those who demonstrate serious and consistent anti-social behaviours, who are at increased risk of becoming lifelong offenders. Encouraging them to engage in traditional “self-help” programmes can be tricky so participating in martial arts could potentially offer a different route. As the authors of the study note, “while psychologically orientated programmes often receive the bulk of the scientific interest, troubled youth often do not co-operate with these traditional approaches. Martial arts, may both complement and form a basis for further cooperation in psychological therapies”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to more traditional methods to reduce aggression, martial arts offer a cost-effective and fun alternative to enhance mental well-being. More research is clearly needed, but these initial findings are promising and seem to confirm the long-held paradoxical belief that participating in combat sports can help reduce rates of violence, anger and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Identification of essential genes for cancer immunotherapy</title>

 Somatic gene mutations can alter the vulnerability of cancer cells to T-cell-based immunotherapies. Here we perturbed genes in human melanoma cells to mimic loss-of-function mutations involved in resistance to these therapies, by using a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 library that consisted of around 123,000 single-guide RNAs, and profiled genes whose loss in tumour cells impaired the effector function of CD8+ T cells. The genes that were most enriched in the screen have key roles in antigen presentation and interferon-γ signalling, and correlate with cytolytic activity in patient tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Among the genes validated using different cancer cell lines and antigens, we identified multiple loss-of-function mutations in APLNR, encoding the apelin receptor, in patient tumours that were refractory to immunotherapy. We show that APLNR interacts with JAK1, modulating interferon-γ responses in tumours, and that its functional loss reduces the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies in mouse models. Our results link the loss of essential genes for the effector function of CD8+ T cells with the resistance or non-responsiveness of cancer to immunotherapies.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Nootropic Effects of Psychedelic and Addictive Substances</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/04/nootropic-effects-of-psychedelic-and-addictive-substances/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In my previous article on the subject of nootropics, I was writing about brain enhancing effects of some medicines and natural compounds. There is, however, a large number of nootropics that received little recognition from official science and remain rather poorly studied. There is a good reason for this too – these compounds tend to be addictive or hallucinogenic. This article aims to cover what is known about the effects of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicotine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather curious that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/16/nicotine-and-nicotinic-receptors-in-disease-and-therapy/&quot;&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known addictive component of tobacco smoke, was confirmed to have nootropic effect. The research into this property of nicotine was triggered by observations that ex-smokers tend to complain about the lack of concentration and general decline in various aspects of cognitive abilities. It turned out that nicotine does improve episodic and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/04/how-do-we-improve-our-working-memory/&quot;&gt;working memory&lt;/a&gt;, as well as attention. Nicotine doses delivered via patches had positive effects (improved performance in cognitive tests) in adults with mild cognitive disorders, as well as in healthy non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis/marijuana and cognitive processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of artistic professions often claim that smoking pot helps &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/14/decoding-creativity-its-in-the-genes/&quot;&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt;. There is scientific evidence to substantiate these claims. Cannabinoids seem to temporarily increase communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain thus creating a state of hyperconnectivity and allowing a loose flow of associations. This may explain the heightened creativity individuals experience when using marijuana. Reports of positive benefits include improved mood, lower levels of anxiety, stress, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/06/brooding-buddies-co-complaining-linked-with-depression-and-anxiety/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, improved focus and fewer distractions, improved reaction times, more creative thoughts, greater verbal fluency, and better calculative complexity. These effects are largely dose-dependent, and taking higher amounts may lead to the opposite effects including sluggishness, lack of focus, nervousness, and impaired memory formation and recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the negative long-term effects of cannabis on brain structure and function have been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/11/15/cannabis-abuse-in-adolescence-cognitive-decline-in-later-life/&quot;&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; associated with the use of cannabis is a serious medical problem, and lots of scientific research aims to gain insights into this problem and the potential approaches to reverse decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey area: Psychedelic drugs (LSD, mushrooms) in microdosing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type “psychedelics” and “microdosing” in Google search, and you will be flooded with thousands of articles claiming that compounds like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/05/psychedelic-assisted-therapy-the-mental-health-trip-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; and psilocybin (active component of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/22/magic-mushrooms-for-mental-health/&quot;&gt;magic mushroom&lt;/a&gt;) have almost miraculous effect on human cognitive abilities. It appears that many inventors, researchers and innovators use psychedelic compounds in very small doses, occasionally or regularly, to reach a state of enhanced consciousness, get into flow, and work more productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is a problem: not a single proper scientific publication supports these claims. There is a good reason for this: due to their well-known hallucinogenic properties and serious potential side effects, psychedelics like LSD are banned in most countries around the world. In fact, LSD was banned in the US and UK back in 1960s. This means that the only peer-reviewed published research that could inform on the actual measurable effects of psychedelics as a nootropic were done 50 years ago. The most commonly cited work (Harman, et. al. (1966) “Psychedelic Agents in Creative Problem-Solving: A Pilot Study.” Psychedelic Reports 19, 211-27.) was published in 1966. Although the findings reported in this publication are interesting, the quality of this work in terms of general organization, the use of suitable control subjects, and statistical power is hardly satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hallucinogenic properties of psychedelics are well documented. Microdosing of these compounds for enhancement of cognitive abilities, however, has not been investigated scientifically. This leave lots of space for imagination and conspiracy theories. There were repeated calls from the research community to lift the ban on research into psychedelics, but so far they seem to have fallen on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous evidences that psychedelics can be used to treat various psychiatric disorders. Some resent studies indicate that administration of psylobicin in moderate doses is not associated with any significant short-term or long-term risk. When it comes to cognitive enhancement, none of the available peer-reviewed scientific publications confirm or rule out such a phenomenon. One interesting resent publication claims that exposure to microdoses of psilocybin creates a state of hyperconnectivity in the brain. The findings from functional MRI experiments show: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“that the structure of the brain’s functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo. This means that the psychedelic state is associated with a less constrained and more intercommunicative mode of brain function, which is consistent with descriptions of the nature of consciousness in the psychedelic state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study indirectly points to the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/03/07/plan-a-cognitive-and-memory-enhancement-program/&quot;&gt;cognitive enhancement&lt;/a&gt; and creative stimulation under the influence of psychedelics. Nonetheless, a more definite confirmation of this phenomenon is yet to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A word in defense of official science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of a more adventurous nature tend to blame the science and medicine industry for slowness in recognizing the benefits of smart drugs. But let’s look at this problem from the perspective of researchers. Most drugs are safe, but from time to time people do experience serious side effects and even life-threatening complications. Nobody wants to be one of the unlucky few. If something goes wrong, you’ll have nobody but yourself to blame. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/05/mental-health-drug-approval-and-biomedical-research-in-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;Regulatory bodies&lt;/a&gt; can recommend any given substance for any particular use only when they have sufficient evidence that a) confirms its effectiveness and b) shows that its side effects are mild and manageable, and/or its benefits far exceed the potential complications associated with its use (i.e., the risk is worth taking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of novel nootropics is hampered by research, validation, and regulatory challenges. The road from the research laboratory to FDA approval is difficult, long, and costly. Pharmacological enhancement of healthy populations is fraught with ethical and philosophical pushbacks. Therapeutic effects observed in cognitively impaired patients often contradict those in healthy populations. Even approved drugs have issues with side effects and large individual differences. The long-term effects of nootropics are typically unknown. Most importantly, there is still much to be learned about the cellular and molecular basis for the various aspects of cognition. Once they are better understood, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/01/20/drugs-and-pharmacology-nineteenth-edition/&quot;&gt;pharmacologists&lt;/a&gt; will have much better ideas about the processes in the brain to target and how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get carried away with the potential opportunities that nootropics might offer. But don’t forget classical approaches: proper &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/19/high-intensity-interval-training-and-brain-health/&quot;&gt;diet and exercise&lt;/a&gt; DO enhance brain functions. Many famous thinkers and creative people benefited from simple regular physical activities. Charles Dickens was spending several hours every day walking, sometimes for as much as 20 or 30 miles. Aristotle and Ludwig Van Beethoven are two other famous people who were known for their habit of wondering around while thinking. Physical activity pumps blood through your body and helps to deliver more oxygen to your brain. Regular exercise and healthy diet also keep your blood vessels healthy ensuring that this vital oxygenation is not reduced as you get older. Your normal lifestyle is responsible for your basic level of cognitive abilities. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/10/22/possible-medical-application-of-a-smart-drug/&quot;&gt;Smart drugs&lt;/a&gt; can be used to spike it up from time to time, but if the basic level is low, the spikes won’t go that high anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, although an occasional joint may heighten your creativity, the regular use of cannabis is definitely not a good approach to enhance cognitive abilities. There is an acute lack of research on benefits (or absence of such) of psychedelics in cognitive enhancement. Virtually all online information on the benefits of psychedelics as cognitive enhancers are completely unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. Any positive or negative appraisals represent personal views of the articles’ authors rather than results of research studies. Your lifestyle influences you basic level of cognitive abilities – don’t ignore generally accepted good strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

It started off with humble beginnings and a membership of six. With time the association became an organization that represented a growing specialty that worked towards seeking improvements in child health. The association received Royal College status in 1996. This year RCPCH celebrated its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/21birthday&quot;&gt;21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; birthday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/stroke-guideline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke in Childhood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke is often viewed as occurring primarily in the elderly. However, stroke is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stroke.org.uk/sites/default/files/uk_childhood_stroke_guidelines_dr_asmaa_abdelhamid.pdf&quot;&gt;top ten&lt;/a&gt; causes of death in children. It can occur in infants, children, and young adults as well as before birth. It has been found that the risk of stroke in children is greatest during the first year of life and it peaks during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/119/3/e21.long&quot;&gt;perinatal period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9361&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9361 size-large&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/RCPCH-2017-21ST-birthday-NB-Nawsheen-1024x665.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image: Nawsheen Boodhun&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RCPCH was recently granted funding by the Stroke Association to develop an evidence-based guideline on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/news/stroke-childhood-guideline-process&quot;&gt;Stroke in Childhood&lt;/a&gt;. The original guideline on stroke was published by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) in 2004. The guidelines needed updating to reflect the best and most up-to-date clinical practice which utilize current evidence. May 2017 marked the launch of the updated RCPCH ‘Stroke in Childhood’ evidence-based clinical and parent guideline which was funded by the Stroke Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/stroke-guideline&quot;&gt;clinical guideline&lt;/a&gt; details the way in which stroke care should be handled and contains information covering the whole process from identification, diagnosis, management and rehabilitation of children and young people with arterial ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke until their transition into adult care. It also contains guidance for parents providing information so families understand what a stroke is, why they occur, and how children and young people affected by stroke should be treated and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child refugee crisis, health and appropriate care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that we are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. Refugees are those who have been forced to flee their country to escape war, violence and persecution. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html&quot;&gt;leading causes&lt;/a&gt; of refugees leaving their countries are war and ethnic, religious and tribal violence. An unprecedented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html&quot;&gt;65.3 million&lt;/a&gt; people around the world have been forcibly displaced from their home where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/child-refugee-crisis-appeal&quot;&gt;over half&lt;/a&gt; are under the age of 18. Around 53% of the refugees worldwide came from three countries: Somalia (1.1m), Afghanistan (2.7m) and Syria (4.9m). The top hosting locations of the worlds displaced people are: Asia and Pacific (14%), Africa (29%), Middle East and North Africa (39%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is basic human rights for migrants and refugees to have access to health services and experience the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. However, the reality is such that there are around 10 million stateless people (one who is not a citizen of any country) who have been denied a nationality and access to basic human rights such as access to education, healthcare, financial protection for health, employment and freedom of movement. A lack of &lt;a href=&quot;http://who.int/migrants/en/&quot;&gt;Universal Health Coverage&lt;/a&gt; can lead to excessive costs for refugees and migrants, many of whom pay out of their own pocket for health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Alf Dubs led a keynote session on ‘Refugee children in the UK and how to offer appropriate care’ on day 2 of the RCPCH conference. During his speech, he explained how those who were in the Jungle in Calais were kept in appalling conditions and that they were ‘existing, not living’. He spoke about the manner in which Brexit takes child refugees off of the political agenda and how the attitudes towards refugee and migrants are not helping the situation. Once a child refugee himself who arrived in the UK in 1939, Lord Alf Dubs ended his segment by highlighting that he would like to see the same opportunities available for child refugees now as he had. Day 2 was concluded by a segment from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/improving-child-health/us-voice-children-young-people-and-families/us-voice-children-young-people-an&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a moving session from the voice of children and young people on seeking asylum and being a refugee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a privilege to have the opportunity to attend the RCPCH conference this year which was interesting, informative and enjoyable. &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; looks forward to attending future events where improvement of child health will be the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Harnessing the ‘base’ motive of material self-interest to promote the common good is perhaps the most important social invention mankind has yet achieved,” said the American economist Charles Schultz. And you can see why. While acknowledging its problems, many &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2017/07/ctrl-alt-del-conservatives-must-reboot-capitalism/&quot;&gt;credit free market capitalism for the dramatic reduction over recent decades in the proportion of people in the world living in extreme poverty&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention rising health standards and technological advances. Conversely, according to some commentators, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/01/venezuela-collapsing-socialist-induced-chaos-yet-remains-corbynista/&quot;&gt;one only has to look to modern-day Venezuela to see the dangers of extreme anti-profit socialism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31434-001&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, most of us have an instinctual anti-profit bias. We view for-profit companies and industries – upon which capitalism is based – with inherent distrust, assuming that the more profitable they are, the more harm they do to society. In fact, research shows the opposite is true: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0170840603024003910&quot;&gt;companies that make greater profits actually tend to contribute more value to society, for example in terms of their environmental responsibility and corporate philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new paper, led by Amit Bhattacharjee at Erasmus University, believe this anti-profit bias leads many voters and politicians to endorse anti-profit policies that are likely to lead to the very opposite outcomes for society that they want to achieve. “Erroneous anti-profit beliefs may lead to systematically worse economic policies for society, even as they help people satisfy their social and expressive needs on an individual level” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27924&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through seven separate studies involving hundreds of online participants, the researchers present evidence that the anti-profit bias arises because we think about for-profit motives in a somewhat superficial, ego-centric fashion. Because the desire for profit is seen as based on selfish intent, we extrapolate to assume that the activities of for-profit companies and industries must be bad for society, disregarding the reality that selfish intents can have positive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also refer to our own mundane “zero sum” experiences, such as buying a car, in which the seller’s profitable gain inevitable comes at our loss. We fail to consider how market forces operate on a massive scale, in which for-profit companies (competing in a free market with informed customers) need to innovate, behave fairly and develop a good reputation in order to be profitable over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the first study, participants rated Fortune 500 companies in terms of how profitable they thought they were and how much they thought they engaged in bad business practices, such as operating at the expense of others with no concern for society. There was a clear pattern: the more profitable participants thought a company was, the more they assumed that it engaged in more bad business practices. In fact expert assessments of the firms shows the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, participants were presented with vignettes of different companies and either told they operated for-profit or not-for-profit. Participants rated the exact same companies, engaging in the same business activities, as more likely to cause social harm, and less likely to bring social benefit, if they were described as for-profit rather than not-for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharjee and his team found that they could attenuate their participants’ anti-profit bias if they prompted them to think about how a long-term profit motive could encourage greater product innovation and quality, better treatment of staff, and more concern for reputation. However, thinking this way doesn’t seem to come naturally. Participants’ baseline judgments about for-profit companies were the same as when they were actively encouraged to assume that customers face few choices and have no information about firms’ reputations (which isn’t the case in a free market, profit-driven economy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of an ingrained anti-profit bias generally held regardless of participants’ economic knowledge or political leanings. This was a US study so it remains to be seen if the same anti-profit bias will be found in other cultures. However, as the researchers point out, their participants “live in one of the most market-oriented societies in human history”, and yet “even as they experience the benefits of market exchange, people express little faith in the power of markets to create and reward value for society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4594-z&quot;&gt;Food hypersensitivity and eating out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food hypersensitivity (FH) encompasses both food allergies and non-allergic hypersensitivities and the key to minimizing symptoms and adverse health outcomes is avoidance of the food/allergen. As a parent, getting your child to eat the right food is challenging enough, but add the complexity of a FH and it becomes a whole lot harder; managing a FH child’s dietary needs is particularly challenging when eating out. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4594-z&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; explored the experiences and behaviours of parents/caregivers when eating out with their FH child. Responses of the participants focused on three themes: ‘family context’, ‘child-focused concerns’, and ‘venue issues’. Eating out as a family was viewed as important to many of the participants; however the challenges associated with ensuring a safe eating out experience for their FH child meant that compromises were often made by at least one family member in order to provide a ‘safer’ venue for the child. Children were often frustrated/disappointed by limited food choices and caregivers believed that their child was ‘missing out’. This qualitative study provides insights into the experiences of caregivers of children with FH when they eat out, and may be of use in tailoring support and information provision to meet the needs of caregivers and children when eating out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neurology: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-017-0921-3&quot;&gt;Neurological symptom assessment in Wilson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder which leads to impaired copper metabolism; pathological build-up of copper occurs mainly in the liver and the brain which results in liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Early diagnosis of WD is critical to improving treatment outcomes, but remains a challenge due to the plethora of symptoms with which patients may present, as well as the complexity of the existing clinical tools. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-017-0921-3&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Neurology &lt;/em&gt;directly compared the two currently used clinical rating scales, in 65 patients receiving treatment for WD, and evaluated their feasibility for use in routine clinical practice. The neurological and psychiatric subscales of the two tools were found to be valuable for detailed assessment of neurological and psychiatric impairment in patients with WD. In contrast, the hepatic subscales showed low correlation with other established measures, underlining the need for further assessment of liver specific rating scales in WD. The authors also developed a short, patient reported, version of one of the scales and suggest its use as a pre-screening tool for the evaluation of WD patients with mild to moderate neurological symptoms, however further studies are required to fully evaluate this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image of the month:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0018-x&quot;&gt;3D visualization of live insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live imaging of whole invertebrates is possible using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), but image quality is often compromised by the movement of live subjects. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0018-x&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that temporary immobilization of live insects, using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, during micro-CT imaging allows 3D visualization of the whole insect without motion artefacts, and enables repeat imaging at multiple time points, without adversely affecting the insects. The authors discuss the article further in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/31/non-destructive-3d-visualization-whole-body-live-insects-2/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder which may develop after an individual experiences a traumatic event. Approximately 20% of children will experience some kind of traumatic event before they are 16 years old, but only some go on to develop PTSD. How can we know which child is at risk for PTSD so that it can be prevented? A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; is the first of its kind to use machine learning to identify risk factors for childhood PTSD; Machine learning is a computational approach designed to find patterns in data that will form reliable and accurate predictive models of specified events (in the case of this study, the occurrence of PTSD in a traumatized child). The study used data from a longitudinal study of children admitted to hospital following an injury; a wide variety of risk factors were assessed whilst the child was in hospital and PTSD was determined three months after hospital discharge. Machine Learning methods were applied to the data and models of risk for PTSD were built and tested for accuracy against the real life incidence of PTSD. A set of causal variables, measured around the time of trauma that predicted PTSD three months later were identified by the models. Author Glenn Saxe tells us more about the study in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/10/machine-learning-predict-childhood-ptsd/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a vital physiological process in growth and development. Angiogenesis is also critical for growth and malignancy of tumors and inhibitors of angiogenesis are promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Semaphorins are secreted proteins that act as axon guidance molecules during the development of the nervous system, but have recently been shown to prevent angiogenesis. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0163-4&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology &lt;/em&gt;examined the potential therapeutic effects of overexpressing Semaforin-3 (Sema3), which is normally expressed at low levels in human oral cancer. Using a lentiviral vector, the authors overexpressed Sema3 in oral tumor cell lines; they demonstrate decreased tumor vasculature &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and drastically suppressed size and capillary density of tumors in xenograft models of oral cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, overexpression of Sema3A in oral cancer cells drastically suppresses the growth of oral cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellins are a genus of marine bivalve molluscs and are one of the largest and most diverse families of bivalves. The taxonomy of tellins is chaotic, largely due to the diversity displayed by their shells. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-017-0535-1&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/em&gt; reports a cytogenetic analysis of four tellin shell species. The authors analyzed the karyotypes (the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus) of the four species, and mapped gene clusters using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The study demonstrates that tellin shells present diverse karyotype compositions. This technique of molecular karyotype analysis provides valuable information for tellin shell identification, and may be helpful for both taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1750, Benjamin Franklin wrote: “There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.” Since then, plenty of research has proven him right: we’re not much good at knowing ourselves and, sadly, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402478&quot;&gt;especially bad when it comes to judging traits in ourselves that we care about the most&lt;/a&gt;. Now Stefan Leach and Mario Weick at the University of Kent, Canterbury, have added to this sorry picture of human delusion, reporting in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/i&gt; that people who believe they’re intuitive are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617706732&quot;&gt;no better than anyone else at tasks that require intuition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27900&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leach and Weick recruited 178 students who completed the Preference for Intuition Scale (which asks respondents to indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements like “With most decisions, it makes sense to completely rely on your feelings”). Some also completed the Faith in Intuition Scale (which includes statements such as “I believe in trusting my hunches”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the participants completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_grammar_learning&quot;&gt;a task&lt;/a&gt; that involved copying out several non-sensical strings of between two and four letters. Unbeknown to the participants, there were complex rules that determined the ordering of these letter strings. After this, they were told that the strings all adhered to hidden grammatical rules and their next challenge was to use their “gut feelings” to decide whether new strings of letters adhered to the rules or not (in these kinds of tasks, implicit learning is thought to manifest consciously as “vague feelings” – intuitions – about what’s going on, though the individual can’t express what their new knowledge actually is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making their judgments, the participants answered questions designed to probe their confidence in their intuitions, how well they thought they did on the task, how much effort they put in, and the extent to which they felt they relied on intuition to decide if a sequence of letters was “correct” or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leach and Weick also ran another study, involving 222 people, which used rules governing the ordering of pictures of people rather than letters. These volunteers also completed a scale exploring their belief in the importance of intuition and their self-rated intuitive abilities before the task, and they answered post-test questions about how well they thought they’d done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of all this new data, as well as some data collected previously, showed that whether a participant considered him or herself to be intuitive or not had no bearing on their performance at judging the letter strings, or their grasp of the rules. When the participants were asked specifically about how confident they were that their particular intuitions regarding this task were accurate, a positive relationship with performance did emerge – but it was very weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have found that people who consider themselves to be more intuitive also tend to believe that their intuitions &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-05479-007&quot;&gt;lead to good results&lt;/a&gt;, and are useful. So these new findings are likely to come as bad news to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that this research involved participants using their intuition to make judgments based on recently acquired knowledge. As the authors themselves stress, “the findings … should not be generalised to other facets of intuition, such as the intuitive decision-making of experts.” However, they added that, “it is interesting to note….that studies on expert intuitions often arrive at similar conclusions as the present research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617706732&quot;&gt;Can People Judge the Veracity of Their Intuitions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When young kids play together there’s often a lot of negotiation involved: “That’s my bunny”, “No, it’s mine”, “OK, you have it”. There’s talk of emotion: “Why are you crying?”, “You took my bunny”. And role-play: “You be baddie”, “No, I’m super-bunny”. Perhaps it shouldn’t be too surprising then that &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12682/abstract&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that young kids, aged 3 to 7, with more siblings have superior Theory of Mind (understanding other people’s mental states and perspectives – an important ability that benefits social and academic performance at school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognition and Development&lt;/em&gt; asks whether the sibling advantage begins as early as toddlerhood, and whether it matters if a toddler’s sibling is older or younger. In fact, against expectations, toddlers with an older sibling showed no Theory of Mind advantage compared with only children, and toddlers with a younger sibling actually performed worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27774&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Élizabel Leblanc and her colleagues tested 227 two-year-olds (113 boys) on two age-appropriate Theory of Mind tasks. One was focused on perspective-taking and required the toddlers to show their mother a toy and in the process deal with various challenges, such the fact she had her eyes closed or was facing the wrong way. The other task pertained to diverging interests: the toddlers had to choose a book to give the researcher, either a children’s book for which she’d previously expressed dislike or an adult book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the 112 kids with one or more older siblings and the 76 only children performed equally well at the two tasks. Number of older siblings made no difference to these results. Meanwhile, the 29 toddlers with a younger sibling (but no older siblings) performed worse at the perspective taking task than both only children and toddlers with an older sibling; they also performed worse at the divergent interests task than the kids with older sibs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, the researchers speculated, toddlers with a younger sibling are disadvantaged by their parents’ attention being diverted to their younger, infant sibling (the toddler also can’t engage in sophisticated play with an infant sibling). On the other hand, maybe toddlers without any siblings are able to match the performance of toddlers with older siblings because of the extra attention they receive from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future studies are required to investigate whether a putative negative effect of younger siblings is robust and apparent in the preschool years, whether it is limited to the toddlerhood period, and whether the mechanisms proposed here are indeed at work,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
