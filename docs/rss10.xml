&lt;p&gt;It’s well-established in psychology that intense emotion and physiological arousal interfere with people’s ability to think straight. Most theories explain this in terms of anxiety consuming mental resources and focusing attention on potential threats. Although it’s tricky to study this topic in the psych lab, a handful of field studies involving parachutists and emergency simulations have largely supported this picture. However, a team at the Autonomous University of Barcelona believe that not enough consideration has so far been given to what they call the “valence” of intense situations – whether or not the person sees the intense experience as positive or negative. To find out whether this makes a difference, Judit Castellà and her colleagues tested dozens of bungee jumpers (most of them first-timers) three times: 30 minutes before a 15M free fall jump; immediately afterwards; and again eight minutes after that.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprising findings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1617675&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;i&gt;Cognition and Emotion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that when an intensely arousing experience is perceived positively, it may actually enhance cognition rather than be impairing. “Although we expected some degree of moderation, that is, an attenuation of the negative impact of high arousal reported in the literature, we did not predict an actual improvement or a total lack of impairment,” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37281&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the three testing stages conducted on a 30M high bridge in Catalonia, the bungee jumpers rated how positive or negative they were feeling, and the intensity of those feelings. They also completed tests of their working memory (the ability to recall strings of digits); their ability to concentrate and pay attention (using what’s known as the Go/No Go Task); and their decision making (their ability to identify which of four packs of cards was the most financially rewarding over time). Their performance was compared with an age-matched group of control participants who completed all the same tests in a similar environment but who were not performing a jump.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the jumpers reported far more intense emotions than the control group. Importantly, the jumpers rated these feelings as highly positive before and especially after the jump. However the main finding is that working memory actually improved in the jumpers after their jump (but not in the controls), and there was a hint that the jumpers’ decision making might have improved too. Meanwhile, the jumpers’ attention performance was unaffected. In short, bungee jumping, although perceived as an intense emotional experience, was not found to impair cognition, and in fact enhanced aspects of it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castellà and her colleagues interpreted their findings in terms of the “Broaden and Build Theory” – the idea that positive emotions can make cognitive functions more flexible and can counteract the narrowing influence of negative emotions. This is just one small study and, as always, the results need replicating and extending. However, the researchers added that their findings could have practical relevance for the training of emergency responders or any professionals who need to make rapid decisions in intensely arousing situations. “Training these professionals to cope with emergency situations by enhancing and focusing on the positive emotions derived from their actions could improve – or at least not impair – their cognitive performance when facing threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;critique of the neural coding metaphor&lt;/a&gt;, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/&quot;&gt;Mark Bickhard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129&quot;&gt;subjective physics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;neural coding essay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9&quot;&gt;in my response to commentaries&lt;/a&gt; (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/&quot;&gt;problematic aspects&lt;/a&gt; with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Building on campaign promises, President Trump has declared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national emergency&lt;/a&gt; to fund a wall on the US-Mexico border, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-dreamers-daca-immigration-announcement-n798686&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to end the DACA program&lt;/a&gt; that allows undocumented children to remain in the US, and threatened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180927.100295/full/#.W7GHsdt-Gns.twitter&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;change public charge rules&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, President Trump doubled down by announcing an immigration reform proposal that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-05-16/trump-to-announce-new-immigration-plan&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase border security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/donald-trump-jared-kushner-white-house-immigration-plan-principles/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;limit visas given to relatives&lt;/a&gt; of US residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a statement by President Trump on immigration, health clinics were deserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a well-regulated immigration system is certainly important, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hispanics-forgo-health-services-to-avoid-officials-attention-advocates-say/2018/01/21/3555412e-ff1d-11e7-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.60bb356523a4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/legal-immigrants-in-seattle-area-alarmed-over-possible-penalties-for-using-benefits/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration’s efforts could lead to an unintended consequence: reducing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1700829?casa_token=CHdj17HI_iwAAAAA:knd2T9vTo6H9mC1MVtc4B8G8wqkAIkizhkCdNsg2geRHB3FrW0geHyjR3oxRYJDgaCgZGZt7oEheX88&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health access&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1711416?casa_token=5y5swy7vY74AAAAA%3AoBrX72-FdlnA9Cctk9BGudA5BLTKSYVPHrISxJ65mfgciZxgqiCcgbnV-xgiNi1t-dFywFBxQdVLD3Q&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; for immigrants already in the US. Scholarly research into this possibility however, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/15/18094901/trump-immigration-policy-food-stamps-snap&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05495&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the large Hispanic immigrant population here in Texas, our research team decided to explore the relationship ourselves, investigating if and how the Trump administration’s immigration efforts have affected Hispanic immigrant health in newly published research in BMC Health Services Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study this relationship, we conducted focus groups with health advocates and Community Health Workers across the state of Texas. These health workers serve as bridge figures between vulnerable populations like immigrant communities and the health system. In detailed discussions held in major cities (Houston and Dallas), border regions (El Paso and McAllen), and more rural parts of Texas, these experienced health workers provided insight into the barriers faced by documented and undocumented Hispanics across the state. Our research identified several key changes in Hispanic health that the Trump administration’s efforts have brought about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is on the rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across our discussions with these health workers, perhaps the most common theme was that fear is on the rise among Hispanic populations. While fear is ever-present in daily life for undocumented immigrants, our participants noted growing fear in the current political environment. For example, one health worker noted that “when he (President Trump) became president, it was noticeable the fear was rising” and another noted that it is “immobilizing people” and that “fear has become a factor of life.” Interestingly, health workers in Houston noted that this fear was particularly problematic during Hurricane Harvey – as many Hispanics avoided the help they needed because in some cases, Customs and Border Patrol boats were being used for water rescues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies and rhetoric matter for health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear, which health workers attributed to the Trump administration’s policy efforts as well as the President’s rhetoric, is decreasing access to needed health services for Hispanics across Texas. For example, one health worker noted that in the wake of a statement by President Trump on immigration, health clinics were deserted: “It was like a Friday… he [Trump] was threatening to deport people left and right. That next Monday and almost the entire week, our clinics, everybody didn’t even cancel, they didn’t show up. They were terrified.” Our participants have suggested that this trend is pervasive across Texas. As the President and his administration continue to emphasize immigration, people are avoiding engaging in many of the activities typical in daily life, including visits to health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children’s nutrition is at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11045&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11045 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Health-access3-300x200.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fearful parents may withdraw their children from nutritional support programs. © FatCamera / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health workers in Texas, the policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children. Our research suggests that children who are eligible for food assistance through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are not getting the nutritional services they need. Some immigrant parents, fearful of their enrollment information being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are dis-enrolling their families in these programs that provide important nutritional services. As one health worker noted, many clients “say I’m not renewing because if I renew I’m going to get deported. So we lost a lot of people… their kids are the ones that were suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, our research suggests that as the Trump administration continues to pursue a hard line on immigration, Hispanic health access could continue to decline. As fear rises, many are not seeking out the social services that they need, affecting documented and undocumented immigrants in Texas, as well as their children. With additional immigration reforms under consideration, health officials in Texas and beyond need to be aware that vulnerable populations may be facing additional barriers to getting the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Looking Good: Tips for creating your PLOS figures graphics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/cMZuq99n1yk/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/art-color-color-palette-159560-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance your research with tips and tools from the experts on the PLOS Production Team. This post is part of our new Format for Success series where we’ll share advice for generating figures and graphics that make submitting a breeze. Stay tuned for more. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that preparing graphics files can be one of the most challenging parts of submitting your hard work to a publisher, when you would rather be observing in the field, experimenting in the lab, or conversing with the community. Like you, we want your research to shine and be noticed by your peers, adding to the scientific discourse and fostering collaboration in and across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you create the best images possible and ensure a smooth article production experience, we’ve put together our top tips, distilled to a few major areas, for assessing your graphics files during submission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider raster images vs vector images&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;em&gt;Raster images&lt;/em&gt; are made of pixels. A pixel is a single point or the smallest single element in a display device. &lt;em&gt;Vector images&lt;/em&gt; are mathematical calculations from one point to another that form lines and shapes, which adjust to fit a monitor display and zoom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journal article pages use raster graphics for in-article figure display, the lightbox figure viewer, and carousel thumbnails.  Raster graphics are easier to create, store, and transfer across platforms, but limit resolution to 600 dpi. Alternatively, vector graphics are only available in the article PDF accessed online, but will result in a more detailed image at high zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a resolution between 300 and 600 dpi&lt;/strong&gt; – Effective resolutions below 300 dpi (dots/pixels per inch) often result in a blurry, jagged or pixelated image that is not optimal to publish, and resolutions above 600 dpi frequently must be resized or rescaled. We are required by the PLOS publishing platform, and community indexes like PubMed Central, to ensure content adheres to these resolutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine multi-panel images&lt;/strong&gt; – Often, it’s useful to exhibit a Part A, Part B, and Part C, all within one figure image. To create a multi-paneled figure from individual images, we suggest using a presentation program like PowerPoint, Word or GIMP to arrange your panels, create labels, and scale or size your figures. Multi-paneled figures need to fit into a single page or be broken apart into separate figures in order to publish clearly and accurately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatten image layers&lt;/strong&gt; – Unflattened images can incorporate alpha channels, which include a transparent layer potentially containing “junk”, “artifacts”. Sometimes, an unflattened image can also render a figure into a complete black or white rectangle, obscuring all your content. We recommend that you flatten your graphics to combine all the layers into a single background layer, so we can ensure the quality of the output equals your intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compress file size with LZW compression&lt;/strong&gt; – Data compression helps to reduce file size and also decreases time required to download and upload content. With compressed files, we can help you reduce the size of your article PDF, improving a researcher’s ability to access your work and send it to colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using PACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you assess your figure images, PLOS also offers authors a free, web-based imaging review tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&quot;&gt;PACE&lt;/a&gt;, that evaluates figures against our platform requirements and fixes the most-common image issues, detailing any changes made, or informs the user what outstanding issues may exist.  PACE compiles two, online review options in the form of typeset page mockups to give users an idea of how the uploaded image would appear in the final article. To use PACE, simply register with your email address: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&quot;&gt;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to undertaking a scientific protocol, PLOS’s production team follows specific rules to ensure that the accepted content is correctly transformed to XML and PDF in order to publish accurately in our journal sites and syndication targets. In short, graphic images must generally conform to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;File format&lt;/em&gt; – TIFF or EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dimensions&lt;/em&gt; – Width: 789 – 2250 pixels (at 300 dpi). Height maximum: 2625 pixels (at 300 dpi).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resolution&lt;/em&gt; – 300 – 600 dpi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;File size&lt;/em&gt; – 10MB or under&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure files naming&lt;/em&gt; – Fig1.tif, Fig2.eps, and so on. Match file name to caption label and citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption&lt;/em&gt; – Place within the manuscript as simple text, not within the figure file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve posted additional graphics recommendations, as well as instructions for exporting graphics from specialized software, here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures&quot;&gt;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope these suggestions make figure preparation even easier so you can spend more time advancing your field and we can publish your work faster than ever.  We encourage you to email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:figures@plos.org&quot;&gt;figures@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; with further questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that more talkative parents have children with superior language or cognitive skills has a long – and sometimes controversial – history. An influential study from the early 1990s claimed that American children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have poorer language development because they hear fewer words from their parents. But scientists have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/01/615188051/lets-stop-talking-about-the-30-million-word-gap&quot;&gt;pointed out several issues with this early research&lt;/a&gt; – including that it involved researchers going into people’s homes to record them, potentially affecting the language they used.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, other researchers in the United States have researched families’ use of language in a less intrusive way – and found that any effects may be more subtle than originally claimed. Now, in what they say is the “largest naturalistic observation study of early life home environments to date”, scientists have brought these methods across the pond. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23388-001&quot;&gt;study of more than 100 London families&lt;/a&gt;, published recently in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, has found that the quantity of language used by parents &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; related to children’s cognitive skills – but exactly why remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37273&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katrina d’Apice from the University of York and her colleagues equipped 107 children aged between two and four with wearable devices that recorded all language spoken by them or their family for three days. Software then automatically processed the recordings, which averaged 15 hours per day, to calculate how many words were spoken by the adults in the family. The children also completed a series of cognitive tests, which involved tasks like copying and drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that adults spoke an average of 17,800 words per day – but this varied considerably. Even within families, the number of words spoken by adults across different days was only moderately correlated. “Our findings emphasize that early life experiences, especially with regard to language, are dynamic processes that change and evolve over time, rather than static environmental determinants,” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team found that, overall, adult word counts were related to children’s cognitive skills: children whose parents used more words tended to do better in the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at the richness of parents’ and children’s vocabulary, finding that children had a greater lexical diversity when adults’ vocabulary was also more diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlational design of the study means it’s impossible to tease apart cause and effect, so there are a number of possible explanations for the findings. It could be that more exposure to language fosters children’s intelligence, for example. Or parents could simply be stimulated to talk more when their children are smarter. There could also be shared genetic effects influencing both the parents’ language and children’s cognitive abilities.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether these results generalise to other groups remains to be seen – more than 80 per cent of parents in this study held a university degree; almost all of them were married; and they were mostly high socio-economic status. Nevertheless, the use of discreet recording devices and automatic language processing software would seem to open up the field to many more naturalistic studies like this in the future.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23388-001&quot;&gt;A naturalistic home observational approach to children’s language, cognition, and behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We move house, change jobs, begin new relationships, yet most of the time, most of us still experience a thread of inner continuity – a constant feeling of me-ness that transcends the various chapters of our lives. Indeed, there’s evidence that having a stable, constant sense of self and identity is important for psychological wellbeing. However, this thread can rupture, leading to an uncomfortable disconnect between who we feel we are today, and the person that we believe we used to be – a state that psychologists recently labelled “derailment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702619829748&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; a group led by Kaylin Ratner at Cornell University has explored the possibility that derailment both precipitates, and is a consequence of, depression. After all, people with depression often struggle with motivation, losing the will to pursue goals they previously held dear. They also frequently withdraw from their relationships and social roles. All of these changes could trigger sensations of derailment. Or perhaps derailment comes first, with the inner disorientation leaving one vulnerable to depression. Surprisingly these questions have been little studied before now. “We nominate derailment as a new feature of the depressive landscape and underscore the need for greater empirical and practical attention at the crossroads of mental health and human development,” Ratner and her team write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37243&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited nearly a thousand undergraduate students and asked them to complete measures of depression and derailment four times over the course of an academic year. The recently developed 10-item derailment measure was based on the students’ agreement or not with statements like “My life has been headed in the same direction for a long time,” and “I did not anticipate becoming the person that I currently am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the students’ scores on depression and derailment were relatively stable across the course of the year. Also, students’ derailment and depression symptoms tended to correlate at each of the measurement time points – implying there may well be an association between the two. In terms of cause and effect, and as the researchers predicted in advance, higher depression scores at an earlier time point tended to presage increases in derailment scores later on. However, in what they described as a “curious finding”, higher derailment scores earlier in the year actually tended to herald a &lt;em&gt;decline&lt;/em&gt; in depression symptoms later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratner and her team propose a number of explanations for this last finding – including that while derailment may be uncomfortable at first, it may catalyze people to withdraw from relationships and/or goals that are unfulfilling, thus leading to wellbeing gains in the longer term. The researchers also pondered whether there might be moderating factors that alter whether derailment leads to increases or reductions in depression – such as whether people find meaning in their feelings of derailment, and/or how much they end up ruminating over the feelings. Such questions remain for future research, as do many other outstanding issues, such as how derailment and depression might be related in other non-student groups and over longer time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although derailment is a novel construct and one that is still in the process of being mapped, researchers and practitioners would be keen to take note of derailment being a feature of depression’s landscape and continue to observe how such perceived changes in identity and self-direction could take shape and act within clinical presentations,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/breastfeeding-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe is working towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. All pregnant and breastfeeding women who are HIV-infected are initiated on Option B+ treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women on this regimen are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for six months along with starting or continuing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Exclusive breastfeeding is not an easy feat, particularly for HIV-infected mothers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2336-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; explored the challenges faced by these women on the PMTCT program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges in implementing and studying PMTCT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study is premised on the assumption that the biomedical framework of ART initiation has informed most of the studies on PMTCT at the expense of the social model of health.  The complex interactions of the biological, psychological and social processes that shape behavior have not been seriously considered.  Mothers on PMTCT are not considered within the context of the broader environmental factors that influence their behavior. Policymakers often do not account for cultural factors when introducing interventions to address societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are multiple advantages from the ‘test, treat, and breastfeed all infants’ strategy of PMTCT, a plethora of challenges can compromise and prevent the achievement of the desired health benefits for both the mother and her infant. These include HIV-related stigma, fear of transmitting HIV to the baby, and  ART side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women’s struggles, in their own words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in our study struggled with exclusive breastfeeding, which was promoted by the health professionals and policy makers. There was consensus among the women regarding their fear of infecting their infants through the breast milk. One woman felt that the nurses were cruel by insisting that they breast feed: &lt;em&gt;“If these nurses were HIV positive would they breastfeed”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our qualitative study revealed that stigma, both enacted and felt, was a reality. One woman felt that people gossiped about her HIV status: &lt;em&gt;“ Whenever I approach people they change the subject and you can tell they were talking about you,”&lt;/em&gt; while another felt that people did not want to be near her: &lt;em&gt;“It is as if I have a stench.” &lt;/em&gt;Health providers, perhaps unintentionally, enhanced the stigma by attending to HIV-infected patients at specific times and labeling them as &lt;em&gt;“those for tablets&lt;/em&gt;” (a local term used for people on ART).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concern about stigma further challenged the women’s adherence to exclusive breastfeeding, fearing that it would be tantamount to giving away one’s HIV status, as it is against the community norms of infant feeding which involves giving water, traditional medicines and foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure of HIV status to family was also a major challenge which negatively impacted on the women’s ability to follow through with exclusive breastfeeding. The women, despite the knowledge received from the health workers, ended up mixed feeding their babies and not adhering to their ART medication due to fear that their families would find out their status. One of the women said, &lt;em&gt;“When I was diagnosed HIV positive during antenatal care, I (hypothetically) asked my husband for his reaction … he became so livid … I hide my medication in the garden ….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study clearly shows that the success of the PMTCT program cannot be merely measured by uptake of Option B+, which rose from 65% to 99% in 2018. Taking cognizance of the contextual factors where interventions are being introduced is key. Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems. There is a need to address cultural practices which could lead to HIV infection in babies during the postnatal period, such as giving babies traditional medicines and other foods. Programs should be aware that a ‘one size fits all’ approach does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a number of revisions which we recognize will make the transition easier for the community, and which clarify or acknowledge other important factors, such as:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversity of models underpinning OA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – The clarification that neither Plan S nor OA insists on the APC/publication fee model is a key refinement. While this has been a dominant model of OA publishing (including ours) in the Global North, it is absolutely necessary for any OA policies, plans, or mandates to be clear that OA is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for research, not a single or specific &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;business model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commitment to research assessment based on intrinsic merit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;– PLOS is an active member of DORA and appreciates the emphasis on changing the reward and incentive system of research. The OA movement has always operated closely with movements to improve the culture of research, and so we welcome this acknowledgement;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preprints and peer review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – PLOS advocates the posting of preprints to accelerate sharing of knowledge and welcomes cOalition S’s  “strong encouragement” for the early sharing of research through preprints while acknowledging that preprint posting alone is not a route to Plan S compliance. The value of high quality peer review as a “significant addition of value to scholarly communication” as emphasized in the Plan S Rationale is recognized at PLOS and was a driver in our move to offer published peer review, giving authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The timeline shift for Plan S implementation to 2021 will be helpful to gain even more community support for the initiative. But we (along with many other publishers) remind the community that PLOS is already 100% Plan S compliant, and our suite of seven journals is available immediately for your cOAlition S-funded work  in most scholarly disciplines relevant to Plan S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS was founded on the principle that scholarly knowledge is a public good. We welcome the bold move of funders aligned behind the fundamental principle that no scholarly publication should be locked behind a paywall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and I would often be so hooked on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis&quot;&gt;Sega Mega Drive&lt;/a&gt; video game that we’d play all day long, breaking only for munchies or when nature called. Our parents would urge (plead with) us to get outside, especially when it was sunny. “The fresh air and exercise will do you good”, they would say, or similar. Fast forward to now, and the anxiety over all the time that children and young people spend in front of screens, be it playing video games, watching TV or using social media, has of course only intensified. Surely it can’t be mentally or physically healthy, can it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look to psychologists to provide an answer, we find a field divided. At one extreme, some experts point to survey data throwing up apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/&quot;&gt;worrying correlations between increased screen time and increased mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;. Yet other experts are sceptical, in part because of what they see as the poor quality of much of the correlational evidence for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this latter camp are Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski at the University of Oxford, the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, which aims to set new standards for research in this area – including by using time-use diary-based reports of screen time (rather than relying on notoriously unreliable retrospective reports), and by pre-registering their methods and hypotheses, thus guarding against the kind of post-hoc data-mining that they say has plagued the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37215&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair began with an exploratory analysis of two large surveys of thousands of teenagers, one based in Ireland, the other in the USA. These included data on teens’ mental health and wellbeing (including mood, depression and self-esteem) and their screen time (including time on TV, computer, and video-games and smartphones). The screen time measures included commonly used retrospective reports, such as “how much time do you typically spend during a weekday watching TV, playing video games etc?”, but crucially also detailed diary-based measures, in which each participant broke down their precise activities during every 15-minute period of a given day (either completed through that day, in the evening or the next day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orben and Przybylski found a handful of statistically significant correlations between screen time and wellbeing, and then they used these to make some specific evidence-based, pre-registered (written down publicly in advance) predictions about the kind of screen time–wellbeing associations they were looking for in a second, “confirmatory study”. This is a robust methodological approach that avoids the pitfalls of scouring a large data set hunting for all and any significant correlations (such post-hoc result hunting carries the risk that any associations that do turn up are flukes rather than meaningful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey data Orben and Przybylski used in their confirmatory study involved over 10,000 British teenagers (aged 14 to 15) and their caregivers, who once again provided retrospective and diary-based information on their screen time and completed wellbeing measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a few statistically significant correlations, including: between greater self-reported screen time and lower wellbeing; and greater diary-recorded screen time and lower wellbeing. Based on some mixed results from the exploratory work, the pair also looked specifically at screen time prior to bed, but this was not found to be associated with wellbeing. Critically, the significant associations that Orben and Przybylski did find were very weak – in fact, of a magnitude “too small to merit substantial scientific discussion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair provide a graphic illustration of the average size of the associations between screen time and wellbeing that they found. Assuming that causality flows in the direction of greater screen time to poorer wellbeing (the research is cross-sectional so we don’t know if this is the case), then given the size of the association, teenagers would have to increase their screen time use by over 63 hours per day for it to have an effect on their wellbeing that they would actually notice (this is based on what is known from past research about the kind of wellbeing changes that are subjectively noticeable). Of course such an increase is a practical impossibility, thus showing the practical insignificance of the documented correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While aiming to set new standards for research in this area, the researchers admit their study has its own limitations – among them that the data on screen time and wellbeing were not collected at the same time, potentially reducing the chance to identify meaningful relations between the two. Also, some may wonder whether total screen time (however carefully it is measured) is the right metric – perhaps it is too crude and it is the nature of one’s relationship with digital devices that is more relevant to wellbeing, such as why they are used, whether the screen time displaces other meaningful activities, and if there is a compulsive quality to the usage or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329&quot;&gt;Screens, Teens, and Psychological Well-Being: Evidence From Three Time-Use-Diary Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How does family history affect the risk of preterm birth?</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/05/31/how-does-family-history-affect-the-risk-of-preterm-birth/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-4-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you look at a sibling design to study associations between maternal and offspring preterm birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to term infants, preterm infants, especially those born earliest, are more likely to experience a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608601361?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;myriad of health-related problems&lt;/a&gt;, from neurodevelopmental problems in childhood to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders later in life. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608600744?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;etiology of preterm birth&lt;/a&gt; is multifactorial, complex and not well understood. One poorly understood factor is the intergenerational recurrence of preterm birth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3109/00016340903358820&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; have consistently shown that women born preterm are more likely to have preterm babies. Based on this evidence, it has been recommended to include maternal birth status in risk assessment when planning pregnancy care for individual women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with most previous studies is that they were not designed to account for familial confounding. Comparing preterm delivery rates of women born preterm versus women born at term, regardless of family characteristics, does not answer the question of whether being born preterm is itself a risk factor for preterm delivery. Women born preterm may have different family characteristics than those born at term and those characteristics may account for the higher risk of preterm delivery. To answer that question appropriately and rule out familial confounding, we need to compare sisters of discordant preterm birth status using sibling designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibling designs are particularly suited to study the effect of a factor that differs between siblings; in this case, whether a woman who was born preterm is more likely to deliver preterm than her sister(s) not born preterm. If being born preterm is itself a risk factor, then preterm sisters would be more likely to deliver preterm babies than their sisters not born preterm. Conversely, if discordant siblings have a similar risk of delivering preterm, this means that being born preterm is not the cause, but something else that is shared by the sisters and puts both sister at higher risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2304-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;That is precisely what we found&lt;/a&gt;. Women born at term with a sister born preterm had a similarly elevated risk of delivering a preterm infant (10%) as their preterm sisters, in contrast with women born at term with sisters born at term (6.1%) or without sisters (6.0%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the potential implications of your research in identifying women at higher risks of preterm delivery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main implication is that the focus of the risk assessment may be better shifted from the individual to the family. Our results suggest that it is not the fact of having been born preterm that puts women at higher risk of delivering preterm, but the fact of having been born to a mother who ever delivered preterm. Our findings do not support the notion of seeing maternal preterm birth status itself as an individual risk factor for preterm delivery. Rather, consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery and perhaps other pregnancy complications characterized by intergenerational transmission patterns, such as hypertensive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/20/three-week-diary-study-sex-today-increases-sense-of-meaning-in-life-tomorrow/&quot;&gt;important part&lt;/a&gt; of most &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/14/try-something-new-together-research-shows-engaging-in-self-expanding-activities-rekindles-the-sexual-desire-of-long-term-couples/&quot;&gt;romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; – and when couples are not on the same page about their sex life, it can become a source of frustration. Research has found that couples have sex about 1 or 2 times a week, but about half of sexual advances between partners go unfulfilled.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/p9nc8/&quot;&gt;uploaded recently to PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; sheds some light on how responses to sexual advances influence individuals’ feelings of sexual and relationship satisfaction. The study suggests that while having an advance accepted leaves partners feeling more content, this effect may be short-lived compared to the dissatisfaction of being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37241&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a peek into the bedrooms of 115 heterosexual couples (participants were aged between 19 and 64), Kiersten Dobson from the University of Western Ontario and colleagues asked them all to keep sex diaries. Every day for 3 weeks, both partners independently logged whether they or their partner had made a sexual advance, and if so, whether that led to sexual activity. They also recorded their daily levels of satisfaction with their sexual relationship, as well as their relationship generally, answering questions such as “How good is your relationship compared to most?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found that accepting a sexual advance, or having an advance accepted by the partner, resulted in an increase in both sexual and relationship satisfaction that day compared to other days.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, being rejected decreased sexual satisfaction. But intriguingly, if the participant themselves was the rejecter – that is, if they shunned an advance from their partner – their sexual satisfaction still increased. (Neither being rejected nor being the rejecter had any effect on general relationship satisfaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in sexual satisfaction could still be detected days after advances were made. The team found that the boost in satisfaction from having an advance accepted persisted for 24 hours, with the slump of being rejected lasting twice as long. And the gratification that came from being either an acceptor or a rejecter lasted a remarkable 72 hours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem especially surprising that rejecting a partner’s advances gives a boost in sexual satisfaction, particularly one that appears to last for three days. But rather than reflecting some pleasure derived from rejecting someone, the researchers suggest that being approached for sex leaves a person feeling desired, so enhances sexual satisfaction even when no actual sex ends up happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the negative effects of being sexually rejected by a partner last longer than the positive effects of being accepted mean that making an advance can be a risky move, the authors say.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“The act of making a sexual advance may be a high-risk situation for romantic partners, which may in turn lead those who feel less sure of their partner’s response to an advance to take the risk of making an advance less often,” they write. This could ultimately lead to fewer opportunities to bolster intimacy through sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t reveal anything about whether there is a way to buffer against the negative effects of rejection, though, or how different individuals respond. For example, the same team previously found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/25/study-of-long-term-heterosexual-couples-finds-women-over-estimate-and-men-underestimate-their-partners-sexual-advances/&quot;&gt;men underestimate, and women overestimate, how often their partners make sexual advances&lt;/a&gt; – though gender didn’t seem to play a role in the new study. However, it would be interesting to know whether other individual differences might alter people’s responses to acceptance or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/p9nc8/&quot;&gt;Responses to sexual advances and satisfaction in romantic relationships: Is yes good and no bad?&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version on which this report was based]&lt;/p&gt;

PLOS is excited to support reagent repositories such as Addgene as yet another step to improve scientific reproducibility. Open access to research findings and the underlying methods, materials and data, and issues surrounding reproducibility, replication, and research waste will be discussed this June 2-5 at the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcri2019.org/index/programme/conference-theme&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; World Conference on Research Integrity in Hong Kong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, where PLOS ONE’s Senior Editor, Renee Hoch, will present a talk on data availability and image integrity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Without materials and data, there is no research. Barriers to scientific progress can result from something as basic as not having access to reliable, validated information for research materials. That barrier is raised further when scientists cannot obtain samples or data in a timely fashion. Data and material repositories are breaking down these barriers. As a publisher, PLOS is supporting better, more open science by recommending repositories and encouraging use of standardized, unique identifiers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;for materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Centralized depositing of materials advances science in so many ways. It saves authors the time and burden of shipping requested materials. Researchers who request from repositories save time by not having to recreate reagents or wait months or years to receive samples. Many scientists have been on the receiving end of a request that was filled by an incorrect or degraded sample, which further delays research. Repositories like the ones recommended by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; handle the logistics of material requests, letting the scientists focus on what’s important: doing research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For example, repositories make it possible for researchers to get access to different cell lines (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atcc.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;American Type Culture Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coriell.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Coriell Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), plant materials (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://abrc.osu.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), organisms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsc.indiana.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/home&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Caenorhabditis Genetics Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xenopusresource.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;European Xenopus Resource Centre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jax.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), plasmids (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addgene.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;DNASU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/Home.xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PlasmID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) and many other biological materials. Moreover, many of these repositories provide web-based databases that are easy to search and provide openly available information about each material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For reagent reporting, many repositories also support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/unique-and-persistent-plasmid-ids-available-addgene-plasmid-ids-rrids&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; unique and persistent identification of reagents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Identifiers like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; make it easy for authors to cite materials and improves reporting through standardized identification and a permanent link to information about each reagent. For example, each &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Drosophila&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; strain at the Bloomington Fly stock Center is assigned a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=BDSC_722&amp;amp;l=BDSC_722&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;fly stock RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. For mice, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) provides a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=MMRRC_026409-UCD&amp;amp;l=MMRRC_026409-UCD&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mouse RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for mutant mouse strains. For plasmids, Addgene will automatically register a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;amp;l=Addgene_44362&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;plasmid RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; upon deposit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depositing increases materials transparency and reproducibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene currently contains over 70,000 unique plasmids and has distributed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/celebrating-one-million-plasmids-shared&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;over 1,000,000 plasmids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; worldwide since 2004. At Addgene, depositing plasmids is free and straightforward, with the added bonus that it provides quality control measures that contribute to improved reproducibility. Addgene performs full plasmid sequencing and each plasmid is assigned a unique &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;amp;l=Addgene_44362&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;RRID identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, along with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addgene.org/44362/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;a plasmid webpage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that provides sequence data, cloning information, and associated protocols. This ensures researchers have detailed information about each plasmid reagent. Moreover, each Addgene plasmid page provides an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/more-data-for-you-find-articles-citing-addgene-plasmids&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Articles Citing this Plasmid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; section which allows researchers to learn how the plasmid was used and validated by different labs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognition and credit for depositing authors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Depositing materials at the time of publication also provides benefits to both authors and publishers. Depositing authors gain recognition and are cited whenever requestors use the published materials in their own research articles. In fact, data from Addgene supports that depositing published plasmids in Addgene’s repository increases their use and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/addgene-depositors-get-more-citations&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;results in increased article citations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Deposition at the point of publication also ensures timely distribution of materials. Finally, the information linked to each deposited reagent serves as reliable open data for the materials reported in the publication, simplifying the manuscript-writing process. Overall, PLOS’s support of reagent repositories, follows the publisher’s steps in improving &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocol sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and is a welcome addition for improving materials access and scientific reproducibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New sharing practices will change science for the better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By encouraging authors to deposit materials at the time of publication, journals will help accelerate research through timely distribution and accurate identification of reagents. Biological repositories exist to serve the scientific community. Take &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/crispr.2018.0022&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene’s involvement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in the explosive advancement of CRISPR research. Since 2012, over 8,400 CRISPR plasmids have been deposited and Addgene has distributed over 144,000 CRISPR plasmids worldwide, enabling researchers to share, modify, and improve this game-changing molecular tool. It is a prime example of the positive impact that biological repositories are making on research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thanks to PLOS’s updated recommendations, the importance of depositing and sharing reagents is finally getting some much-needed recognition. If the positive outcomes of PLOS’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocol sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; policies is any indication of what’s in store for open material sharing, the future of science looks bright: speedier, more transparent, and more reproducible research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hurt myself today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To see if I still feel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Hurt &lt;/i&gt;by Nine Inch Nails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate self-injury (without the intent to commit suicide) is widely thought to be a way that some people, especially teenagers and young adults, cope with or express feelings that they find overwhelming. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/2azer/&quot;&gt;a set of three studies&lt;/a&gt; published as a preprint at &lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt; by psychologists at Swansea University, reveals that difficulties with perceiving and interpreting the bodily signals of emotion may also play a role – a finding that could help inspire new treatment approaches.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37238&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, interviews with people who have self-harmed have included reports that they feel both “overwhelmed” by emotions they can’t identify, but also emotionally detached or “numb”. Hayley Young and her colleagues reasoned that if an individual is struggling to read their bodily signals of emotion properly (and “interoceptive ability” – the ability to sense physiological signals – is known to dip in adolescence), then self-injury may work to generate a stronger bodily input into their emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three related studies using more than 300 young adult participants, mostly women. In the first few studies, the researchers looked for links between self-harm and self-reported factors, such as perceived difficulties in identifying and describing emotions. In the final study, interoceptive ability was measured using a standard method in which a person has to count their heartbeats over a period of time (without actually feeling for a pulse or using any other aid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results revealed that participants with a history of self-harm were characterised by “a difficulty in distinguishing and interpreting interoceptive signals”. Participants who had self-harmed reported being &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; aware than others of general bodily sensations, but they tended to score worse on the interoceptive accuracy test.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an important finding as low interoceptive awareness may be the biological basis for reports of ‘absent affect’ and ‘detachment’ and ‘disembodiement’” in those who self-harm, the researchers write. Low interoceptive accuracy may also contribute to self-harm, they suggest, in driving the individual to manipulate the way the body contributes to the experience of emotion.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function of self-harm “may be to resolve a state of interoceptive and emotional uncertainty —&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;[it] may serve to disambiguate the body’s role in emotional experience and provide clarity about what is being felt,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research that’s linked superior interoception to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68667/&quot;&gt;better emotional functioning&lt;/a&gt;, including experiencing more nuanced emotions. Conversely, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/74442/&quot;&gt;poor interoception has been associated with a wide range of mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including depression and schizophrenia.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young and her team added that their research suggests a pathway to new interventions: “a focus on improving compassionate self-focus may be beneficial.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, other groups are actively working on ways to improve people’s interoceptive accuracy. Sarah Garfinkel at the University of Sussex and her team are trialling just such a treatment for people with autism (poor interoception is relatively common in people with autism spectrum disorder). A pilot study on healthy people, which involved asking participants to count their heartbeats, and giving them feedback on how well they were doing, led to improvements in interoceptive accuracy and reductions in anxiety. This treatment research is ongoing. In theory, it might help with other conditions, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/2azer/&quot;&gt;Non-Suicidal Self-injury is associated with Multidimensional Deficits in Interoception: Evidence from Three Studies&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subject to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version upon which our report was based]&lt;/p&gt;

proposal here, and give feedback: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112&quot;&gt;https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, given that a large number of community members congregate at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://flocktofedora.org/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;, it may be a good chance to get together those of us that work in
science/research and related areas. So, if you are planning to attend &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://flocktofedora.org/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;
and work in, or are interested in science/research, please drop a note at this
tracker ticket: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242&quot;&gt;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have enough of us, we can look at proposing a hackathon also. The first
round of CFPs for flock starts on June 1. So we won't make it for that. We
should be able to make it for the second round on June 15, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

They are canids – dog-like carnivores – with one of, if not the widest distributions of terrestrial mammals in the world. Due to their extreme adaptability, they have successfully colonized almost all terrestrial environments on the planet, from the icy tundra of the North to the scorching hot Australian Outback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11067&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11067&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/9550_07150799-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red foxes don’t need much of an introduction&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also cope well with landscape types that are heavily modified by humans, such as for example agricultural landscapes and even cities. Here, they find all the required resources in abundance and, as a result, can become very abundant themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem in itself, but it can become one for the species that foxes prey upon. Species that are very specialized in their habitat requirements often struggle to survive in heavily fragmented landscapes due to the loss of habitat, but also because of the lower suitability of the remaining habitat fragments. Picture a small forest surrounded by crop fields. Although it is normal for foxes to prey on these species, in such a situation, high predatory losses may become the nail in the coffin for some of those species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, it is often impossible to reverse changes to the landscape and its habitats. Instead, wildlife managers and conservation practitioners often attempt to control populations of abundant predators (including foxes) to benefit prey, usually by means of culling. However, owing to a variety of reasons (e.g. the legal framework, property rights, limited resources), control attempts often take place in comparatively small areas bordering on non-hunted sites that act as a source of foxes to compensate the cull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their widespread occurrence, the effectiveness of such control attempts in terms of their conservation returns is rarely evaluated and therefore not well understood. This may imply that their application is legitimized by conservation targets that are, in fact, often not being achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about effectiveness, we mean two things: first off, control attempts need to cause a reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11066&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11066&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/7765_08010371-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fox taking artificial eggs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in fox abundance of relevant magnitude at the target site. More importantly though, reduced abundance needs to be reflected by reduced predation risk for the prey species over a period of time that is considered particularly relevant, such as its reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, when we decide in favor of killing wild animal populations, we need to make sure that this will actually result in a better chance for the threatened prey to survive. Otherwise, both ethical and economic issues make the matter too contentious to qualify as a management tool in conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the issue we tackled in a recent research project using fox culls in fragmented montane forests as a study system. Using camera-supervised ‘artificial nests’ consisting of brown chicken eggs placed in the forest to serve as a standardized index of predation risk, we evaluated whether incentivized, but spatially heterogeneous fox culls led to a reduction in predation risk and the probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the early summer months of 2017 and 2018 for our experiments to coincide with the reproductive period of a locally threatened prey species: the capercaillie, a fairly specialist bird that nests on the ground in mature and well-structured forest stands. The majority of culling had taken place during the winters preceding the study periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11063&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11063&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Capercailliefemale-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A female capercaillie close to an artificial nest&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using statistical models, we did not find an effect of restricted-area fox culls on predation risk, nor a lower probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites. We know from other research (including our own) that culls of this magnitude can reduce local fox abundance, but effects appear to be compensated by fox populations too rapidly for conservation benefits to manifest. This was the case despite cull intensity likely exceeding red fox density in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly (and in contrast to previous work), there was no relationship between the degree of landscape fragmentation &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; and our index of predation risk, as soon as we had accounted for differences in predator abundance. Instead, predation risk appeared to be driven directly by the abundance of foxes in the landscape around a plot. This suggests that the increased abundance of generalist mesopredators in diverse, fragmented landscape types may be a key factor for elevated predation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implementation of our work is that predator control attempts will – to be effective as a conservation tool – need to be spatially and temporally coordinated to match the biology of both the predator and the target prey species. Whether this can be feasible, depends strongly on regional and local ecosystem contexts and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Otherwise, there is currently little evidence to support uncoordinated culls as a conservation measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write down the unfinished statement “I am …” twenty times. Now think to yourself “Who am I?” and complete as many of the “I am …” statements as you can in the next five minutes or less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Twenty Statements Test and it’s designed to assess how we see ourselves – our “self-concept”. For their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2019.1608256&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;, a team at the University of Reading, led by Emily Hards, gave this test to 822 teenagers (aged 13-18) from three schools in England, with the additional instruction “not to think too much about the responses and not to worry about the order/importance of the statements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s widely recognised that adolescence is a crucial period for the establishment of our sense of self, little is actually known about how teenagers’ generally see themselves. Indeed, this is the first time that teenagers’ own self-generated descriptions of themselves (what the researchers call their “self-images”) have been gathered in a systematic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37210&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the participants provided 6,558 self-descriptions or self-images. After removing any redundancy (for example, treating “I am irritating at times” and “I am somewhat irritating” as the same response), the researchers calculated that the teens came up with 443 different ways of describing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the participants provided eight self-images. The twenty most commonly given, from most to least, were: happy, a son/daughter, funny, a student, a sports player, a friend, a brother/sister, kind, friendly, [some kind of description of] appearance, [description of] height, tired, sporty, caring, confident, [something about their] age, love, smart, shy, [description of their] gender, quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall then, at a time when there is much talk of a crisis of mental health among young people, the researchers said their results paint a rather a “striking and reassuring” picture. Most of the teens’ self-images pertained to traits, and most of them were positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ focus on their personal characteristics and traits is consistent with “broader ideas in developmental psychology,” the researchers said, “which suggest that during adolescence young people become increasingly focused on their ‘psychological interior’ and engage in self-reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few gender differences were apparent: girls tended to provide more self-images than boys; girls more often described themselves as a daughter (relative to how often boys described themselves as a son), as being a sibling, a friend, mentioning their appearance, as tired, caring, love, shy, or quiet; whereas boys more often described themselves as a sports player and sporty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared the teenagers’ self-images with those obtained in an earlier study from a sample of predominantly young adults (aged 18 to 30). The main difference was that whereas the teenagers mostly described themselves in terms of their traits, the adults more often described themselves in terms of their social roles, such as friend or son. “…[S]ocial roles may be more accessible and important among adults than adolescents” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images we form of ourselves in adolescence can have a lasting impact on the rest of our lives – shaping (and being shaped by) the autobiographical memories that we hold most dear, thereby influencing the way we see ourselves for years to come. Though limited by its monocultural and cross-sectional design, this research helps lay the groundwork for a better understanding how people come to see themselves the way they do, and for investigating what might be different about the self-images of those teenagers who develop depression or other mental health problems. Hards and her colleagues have also made their findings publicly available as a searchable database, providing a useful resource for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidrobson.me/&quot;&gt;David Robson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates famously declared that “the unexamined life is not worth living” and that “knowing thyself” was the path to true wisdom. But is there a right and a wrong way to go about such self-reflection?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple rumination – the process of churning your concerns around in your head – isn’t the answer. It’s likely to cause you to become stuck in the rut of your own thoughts and immersed in the emotions that might be leading you astray. Certainly, research has shown that people who are prone to rumination also often suffer from impaired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000308&quot;&gt;decision-making under pressure&lt;/a&gt; and are at substantially increased risk of depression.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the scientific research suggests that you should adopt an ancient rhetorical method favoured by the likes of Julius Caesar and known as “illeism” – or speaking about yourself in the third person (the term was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/01/illeism-the-weird-habit-of-talking-about-oneself-in-the-third-person/&quot;&gt;coined by Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/a&gt; from the Latin &lt;em&gt;ille&lt;/em&gt; meaning “he, that”). If I was considering an argument that I’d had with a friend, for instance, I may start by silently thinking to myself “David felt frustrated that…” The idea is that this small change in perspective can clear your emotional fog, allowing you to see past your biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bulk of research has already shown that this kind of third-person thinking can temporarily improve decision making. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/a5fgu&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt; finds that it can also bring long-term benefits to thinking and emotional regulation. It is, according to the authors, “the first evidence that wisdom-related cognitive and affective processes can be trained in daily life and of how to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grossmann’s aim is to build a strong experimental footing for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evidencebasedwisdom.com/&quot;&gt;study of wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, which had long been considered too nebulous for scientific inquiry. In one his earlier experiments, he established that it’s possible to measure wise reasoning and that, as with IQ, people’s scores matter. He did this by asking participants to discuss out-loud a personal or political dilemma, which he then scored on various elements of thinking long-considered crucial to wisdom, including: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/&quot;&gt;intellectual humility&lt;/a&gt;; taking the perspective of others; recognising uncertainty; and having the capacity to search for a compromise. Grossmann found that these wise-reasoning scores were far better than intelligence tests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%25252Fa0029560&quot;&gt;predicting emotional well-being, and relationship satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; – supporting the idea that wisdom, as defined by these qualities, constitutes a unique construct that determines how we navigate life challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, Grossmann has also looked for ways to improve these scores – with some striking experiments demonstrating the power of illeism. In a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916084&quot;&gt;laboratory experiments&lt;/a&gt;, they found that people tend to be humbler, and readier to consider other perspectives, when they are asked to describe problems in the third person.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, for instance, that you are arguing with your partner. Adopting a third-person perspective might help you to recognise their point of view or to accept the limits of your understanding of the problem at hand. Or imagine you are considering moving jobs. Taking the distanced perspective could help you to weigh up the benefits and the risks of the move more dispassionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This previous research only involved short-term interventions, however – meaning it was far from clear whether wiser reasoning would become a long-term habit with regular practice at illeism.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Grossmann’s team first asked nearly 300 participants to describe a challenging social situation,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;while two independent psychologists scored them on the different aspects of wise reasoning (intellectual humility etc). The participants then had to fill out a daily diary for four weeks. Each day they had to describe a situation they’d just experienced, such as a disagreement with a colleague or some bad news. Half were prompted to do so in the first-person, while the others were encouraged to describe their trials from a third-person perspective. At the end of the study all participants repeated the wise-reasoning test.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossmann’s results were exactly as he hoped. While the control participants showed no overall change in their wise reasoning scores, those using illeism improved in their intellectual humility, perspective-taking and capacity to find a compromise.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further stage of the study suggested that this newfound wisdom also translated into greater emotional regulation and stability. After they had finished the four-week diary intervention, participants had to predict how their feelings of trust, frustration or anger about a close family member or friend might change over the next month – then, after that month was up, they reported back on how things had actually gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with other work on “affective forecasting”, the people in the control condition over-estimated their positive emotions and under-estimated the intensity of their negative emotions over the course of the month. In contrast, those who’d kept a third-person diary, were more accurate. A closer look revealed that their negative feelings, as a whole, were more muted, and that’s why their rosy predictions were more accurate. It seems their wiser reasoning had allowed them to find better ways to cope.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find these emotion and relationship effects particularly fascinating, considering the fact that illeism is often considered to be infantile. Just think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=577&quot;&gt;Elmo in Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;, or the intensely irritating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimmy&quot;&gt;Jimmy in Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; – hardly models of sophisticated thinking. Alternatively, it can be taken to be the sign of a narcissistic personality – the very opposite of personal wisdom. After all, Coleridge believed that it was a ruse to cover up one’s own egotism, and many of President Trump’s critics have pointed out with disapproval that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33943762&quot;&gt;he often refers to himself in the third-person&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly politicians like Trump may use illeism for purely rhetorical purposes, but when applied to genuine reflection, it appears to be a powerful tool for wiser reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers point out, it would be exciting to see whether the benefits apply to other forms of decision making besides the more personal dilemmas examined in Grossmann’s study. There’s reason to think they might. Previous experiments have shown, for instance, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-012-9311-3&quot;&gt;rumination leads to worse choices in poker&lt;/a&gt; (hence why expert players strive for a detached, emotionally distanced attitude), and that greater &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2007.26279217&quot;&gt;emotional awareness and regulation can improve performance on the stock market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Grossmann’s work continues to prove that the subject of wisdom is worthy of rigorous experimental study – with potential benefits for all of us. It is notoriously difficult to increase general intelligence through brain training, but these results suggest that wiser reasoning and better decision making are within everyone’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The hidden problem of malnutrition among older adults in developed regions</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/05/24/the-hidden-problem-of-malnutrition-among-older-adults-in-developed-regions/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/old-nutrition-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malnutrition&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHO definition&lt;/a&gt; of malnutrition includes deficiencies and excesses in the intake of nutrients and/or micronutrients, resulting in undernutrition and overweight, respectively. Malnutrition is a global issue, with evidence showing that undernutrition and overnutrition &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940822&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coexist&lt;/a&gt; across lower and higher income countries. Although a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0170-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;life-course approach&lt;/a&gt; has been proposed to address the phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition, the issue receives little attention in the older population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In areas with rapid economic growth such as Hong Kong, health and social care have focused on suppressing the growing trend of overweight caused by increased food availability. Overweight and obesity are regarded as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0161-z&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worldwide pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in older adults, particularly in developed regions, given that these conditions are highly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and disabilities. Meanwhile, undernutrition gets little attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1148-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt;, which investigated the nutritional status of 613 home-living older adults in Hong Kong, found that approximately one-third of those we studied were classified as undernourished or at risk of undernourishment. The literature has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/september/managing-undernutrition-in-the-elderly/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that undernutrition in older adults is associated with adverse health outcomes such as hospitalization, frailty, sarcopenia, prognosis, and mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study findings are consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/ageing/en/index1.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;those of the WHO&lt;/a&gt; that malnutrition in the older population is a complex problem involving multiple dimensions. Among various socio-demographic and health-related factors, three of them were associated with malnutrition in our study: visual impairment, poor appetite, and meal-skipping behaviours. Except for poor appetite, the factors found in our study are distinct from those identified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/7/3/507/4653577&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an earlier systematic review&lt;/a&gt;, in which malnutrition was found associated with age, polypharmacy, general health or cognitive decline, poor self-reported health, impaired swallowing, and dysphagia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor appetite is often reported as a factor contributing to malnutrition in older adults in the literature. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1159-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anorexia of Aging&lt;/a&gt; is generally accepted as a normal process of ageing. However, the findings of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-017-0872-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;qualitative study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that poor appetite in older adults can be due to the poor food quality offered by meal services, their limited access to groceries, and a sense of loneliness. It appears that the loss of appetite can be due to modifiable factors in the psychosocial and environmental dimensions, rather than simply explained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1195-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;physiological change&lt;/a&gt; related to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ways to address malnutrition in older adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide useful insights on interventions to address the high prevalence of malnutrition among older adults in developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, regular visual screening and timely eye care in geriatric services are essential. Visual impairment has often been overlooked as part of the ageing process. Our findings revealed that visual impairment may reduce the ability of older adults to prepare meals, reducing nutritional intake. This revealed how physical functioning is related to nutritional status in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, exploring the underlying reasons for poor appetite and skipping meals in this group is crucial. Although increasing food choices or seasoning may improve appetite or rectify the deficiency in micronutrients, psychosocial interventions would be needed should the appetite be affected by mood changes or loneliness. Canteens that offer well-balanced meals for older adults at a low cost could not only ensure intake of at least one nutritious meal but also provide a venue for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study revealed that the nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected, given that malnutrition is a complex issue related to physical and psychosocial dimensions at the individual level as well as to health and social services at the societal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent news highlight reported the UK running on clean energy for over 100 hours is an example of one of many attempts to steer away from coal-based energy with potentially huge environmental impacts. Energy efficiency, reduction of carbon footprint and the impact on the environment has forced us to think of better ways to engineer systems that allow for more cost-effective and sustainable forms of energy. This emerging field of engineering is called energy engineering or energy systems engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11051 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/earth-366722_1920-300x188.jpg&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent commentary published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, authors from Texas A&amp;amp;M University, present the current state of engineered tools in energy generation. With an aim in the field to optimize energy production to be more cost-effective, environment-friendly and easily operational, the task ahead to design such mouldable systems is becoming increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In breaking down what we know so far and the potential areas for growth in this sector, the authors of the commentary introduce some key methods of energy systems engineering that are potentially versatile enough to cater to the changing human and environmental needs and resourcefulness of its tools. They discuss the criteria for selection, methods of optimization of production, and flaws in the current system of energy production. In proposing potential new directions for the field, they propose industry-academia collaborations, the use of information technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, with potentially tapping into interdisciplinary research allowing access of previously unused sources of energy, as the way forward towards cheap and clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1531-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;How does ‘banter’ influence trainee doctors’ choice of career? A qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10978 alignright&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-300x111.jpg&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; /&gt;Banter often comprises stereotypes and caricatures, but despite its biases and distortions, it may still aid career choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does not enjoy a good banter? However, have you ever thought about these friendly exchanges having a deep-rooted impact on your decisions? Researchers from the University of Bath analyse the effect of banter in an interview-based qualitative study among 24 trainee doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first go on to define what ‘banter’ comprises and to what extent it serves to shape their career choices. The content of the banter seems to be diverse but the most common themes among these medics seems to be judgement of demand, work/life balance, workload and personality. Authors note that comments from senior doctors, coupled with their experiences as a trainee, forces them to judge how and where they would best fit within the system. They found that humorous and stereotypical accounts of specialties often led to rivalry, particularly from and about surgeons. Also, lack of expertise featured quite prominently in “friendly banter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies tended to show that propaganda towards or against certain practices, influenced how junior doctors picked their practices. In line with this, the trainee doctors reported as “not being influenced” by negative banter but, authors do note that these are not just taken at face value but are rather assimilated and weighed against other perceived information and experiences to make an informed career choice. In line with the study, “Banter often comprises stereotypes and caricatures, but despite its biases and distortions, it may still aid career choice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1128-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Using an interactive digital calendar with mobile phone reminders by senior people – a focus group study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new technologies emerge, more tools are invented with the aim of making life easier. However, training senior citizens to bring them up to speed with using this technology is certainly a challenge. A recent study published in BMC Geriatrics evaluates the learning and implementation of the smart phone and in particular, an interactive digital calendar app called ‘RemindMe’. This app was designed to be used by community-dwelling seniors with cognitive impairments, to be reminded timely to take their medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 20 seniors who used RemindMe for six weeks took part in this study. RemindMe can be used for scheduling &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11052 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/5307148868_bfa96479d8_b-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;of activities/events, with individual reminders that require conformation of reminders sent by SMS and further more allows self-monitoring based on the interaction with the app. The usefulness and the use of the app was recorded in feedback given by these 20 participants divided into four groups, with questions on how useful they found the reminders and how easy it was to use the app as an integral part of their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technologically developing society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some embraced these new technology-driven reminders, others found it hard to incorporate this into their daily life and often had difficulty using the smartphone, as the app in itself seems to be rather easy to use. Some also found it hard to change from their own regular calendars. In the event that they did manage to use it, they found the reminders helpful, giving them a sense of independence and control over their own lives. While analyzing the symbolic value of this study. The authors point out that “For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technology developing society”. They conclude that in order to promote seniors to embrace digital technology, they should be motivated to use it by clearly showing them the importance and the change it can bring to their everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Family Practice:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0940-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Perspective of healthy asymptomatic patients requesting general blood tests from their physicians: a qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often we see healthy individuals asking for referrals from their doctors to have blood tests without any obvious symptoms. While there are several studies looking at why doctors give in and do end up referring them for these blood tests, there is no study on the patients’ perspective as to why such tests are being requested in the first place. Researchers from Israel have presented a study where they interviewed 15 presumably healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 50 who have requested a prescription for blood tests with no apparent symptom of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11044 alignright&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Health-access1-300x201.png&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With in-depth interviews, the authors identified three main reasons as to why these tests were being requested – those who requested the tests seem to need external validation that all is “OK” within them, they seem to think that periodic blood tests are beneficial in “catching things early”, or they are prompted by someone else’s illness to check if they are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seem to be requesting the blood tests, almost like annual dental exams, adding the routine blood test to their healthy lifestyle’s to-do list, like a healthy diet, stress reduction and regular exercise.  While some of them seemed to think there can really be no harm in taking these regular tests, other seemed to think that this thought was reinforced by adverts on media driving the need for early diagnosis of any potentially life-threatening condition and this is often when they have lost relatives due to conditions like Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the gap between what is known to doctors and what is perceived by “patients”. Blood tests have in fact not proven to aid the early diagnosis of several disorders and also do not affect progression of the disease in many cases. Doctors acknowledge that early diagnosis in certain cases is important but in most cases these tests often lead to the waste of time and money, often leading to patient anxiety and unnecessary procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has substantial practical implications and highlights the fact that doctors should be more proactive in understanding the patients’ motivations, aiming to educate them about when these tests are really necessary, preventing both unnecessary financial burden and potential health risk arising from harmful over-exposure to diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11050 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/syringe-1884784_1920-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Triple-negative breast cancer is both very aggressive and compounded by limited treatment option availability. In order to further understand this form of breast cancer, and derive potential treatment plans, as in other cancers, researchers from Tulane University in New Orleans have turned to patient-derived xenografts, whereby in you inject breast cancer cells taken from a patient into the animal – mice in this case, giving the cells a more human tumour-like characteristic than those purely developed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After verifying that the cells injected into mice did indeed recapitulate the original cancer, the authors went on to make 2D and 3D cultures from these cells to test if a certain drug combination would prove effective in this case or not, prior to treatment of the actual patient, and also see if the tumour develops resistance to the drug. They employed a simple dead or alive staining first to determine if after treatment with a standard drug set had any effect. This allows them to broadly classify the drugs as those that prevent further growth versus those that have no effect on the tumour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They identify that these cells were more sensitive to certain classes of drugs such as those that affect physical constraints within and around the cells, but resistant to others. They note that there are differences in how 2D cultures (a single sheet of cells) respond to treatment as opposed to 3D cultures, that are more complex in structure and characteristic, more similar to what can be found in real tumors. While this system has been tested here with just one form of cancer, and to known drugs, the system and the rather simplistic screen procedure allows for potential expansion and pre-clinical testing across all cancer types and the entire gamut of drugs that are approved in the market. It could also be further expanded to identify efficient drugs against rare and more aggressive cancer types that have, in the past, proved rather difficult to halt, identify and treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophers and mathematicians have long held that maths can be aesthetically pleasing. “Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25447/25447-h/25447-h.htm&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Bertrand Russell, while Carl Friedrich Gauss &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss&quot;&gt;proclaimed that&lt;/a&gt; “The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves in all their beauty only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300927&quot;&gt;a study published recently in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that even those whose lives don’t revolve around logic and numbers also have an appreciation for mathematical “beauty”. People tend to see similarities between mathematical proofs and certain paintings or pieces of music, the study finds, suggesting we all share an intuition for the aesthetics of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37197&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their first study, Samuel Johnson at University of Bath School of Management and Stefan Steinerberger at Yale University asked 300 online participants (200 of whom had not studied maths beyond school level) to read four mathematical arguments. These were written to be accessible even to lay people, and included proofs like those below. The one on the left illustrates that the sum of an infinite geometric series adds to 1, while the other on the right shows that adding consecutive odd numbers always gives a square number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants had to rate on a scale from 0 to 10 how similar each of these arguments was to each of four landscape paintings, including as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hay_Wain%23/media/File:John_Constable_The_Hay_Wain.jpg&quot;&gt;The Hay Wain by John Constable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Storm_in_the_Rocky_Mountains,_Mt._Rosalie%23/media/File:Albert_Bierstadt_-_A_Storm_in_the_Rocky_Mountains,_Mt._Rosalie_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg&quot;&gt;A Storm in The Rocky Mountains by Albert Bierstadt&lt;/a&gt; (below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants tended to agree on the similarity of the various arguments and paintings. For example, when the researchers ranked each participant’s 16 painting-argument ratings from most to least similar, there was significant overlap between participants. And the participants tended to see particular mathematical arguments as being most strongly related to a specific artwork (for example, overall they viewed the proof concerning the sum of consecutive odd numbers as most similar to the Constable painting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consensus among participants regarding how the maths arguments related to the artworks suggests that people share an intuition about the aesthetics of maths, the authors say – otherwise the similarity ratings would have been randomly distributed between participants. “Mathematical beauty, then, does not appear to be solely in the eye of the beholder but appears to have deep psychological roots,” they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers repeated the experiment, replacing artworks with pieces of classical music, including the fugue from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mVqAbdUvd0&quot;&gt;Bach’s Toccata in E Minor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX_8-nmLLHk&quot;&gt;Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, participants’ ratings of the similarity of the maths and music were much higher than the maths/art similarity ratings in the previous study (the authors suggest that “music is imbued with a more mathematical character”), and again there was some consistency in ratings between participants.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, similarity judgements were more consistent between groups with some level of mathematical training than between participants with and without much maths experience, suggesting that aesthetic judgments may change somewhat with expertise. (This idea was also supported by a third experiment, which suggested that participants with mathematical experience may use some additional criteria for judging the beauty of mathematical arguments compared to those without a maths background ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have used a clever paradigm to demonstrate that even laypeople may assign some aesthetic quality to mathematical proofs – “almost as though they treat proofs &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; artworks”. But their experiments reveal frustratingly little about the broader relevance of assigning aesthetic values to abstract ideas. Some researchers have suggested that mathematicians use the “beauty” of an explanation as a guide to whether or not it is true, for example, and the authors seem to suggest that based on their results the same could hold for laypeople. However, they didn’t test this directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we use our aesthetic intuitions could have important implications. If people take into account the aesthetics of abstract ideas when making judgments about those ideas, then that suggests that perceived aesthetics could be a factor in everything from choosing between different scientific theories to making policy decisions, the researchers note. “We hope that this work serves as a broad call to action in investigating the aesthetics of abstract ideas,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;

AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Becerril-García believes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is undesirable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Heeded and acted upon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11&quot;&gt;rumour on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on open access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in &lt;i&gt;vis-à-vis&lt;/i&gt; the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaemex.mx/&quot;&gt;UAEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

Redalyc has developed technology to strengthen and provide visibility to journals in the region. Currently, there are 1,305 journals and upwards of 650,000 full-text articles available on the platform from which more than 100 million texts are downloaded per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Redalyc provides an indexing system. To be accepted for inclusion in the index, journals first have to go through a rigorous quality evaluation process. We also offer services to complement what journals provide on their own websites – e.g. tools to enable journals to generate XML that is compliant with ANSI/NISO JATS standards and to provide PDF, HTML and ePUB reading formats, as well as an article interactive reader for reading articles on desktop computers as well as on mobile devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also provide interoperability and search engine optimisation services to enable the journals to be transparently integrated with the Directory of Open Access Journals (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;DOAJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; and hundreds of content aggregators and libraries all around the world.

We all share the same goal: a collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated open access system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;In control of the academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Should I conclude from what you say that AmeliCA does not believe commercial publishers ought to play a role in scholarly communication?

From where I stand the situation is more complex, and even more complex when we observe the different regional contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We know that before the Second World War the participation of commercial publishers was limited, and journals depended mostly on professional associations. In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;the oligopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;amp;Src=IP&amp;amp;Alias=WOK5&quot;&gt;Web of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scopus.com/&quot;&gt;Scopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Consequently, researchers are forced to publish in journals owned by commercial publishers who are mainly based outside the region, and in order to make their work open access they now have to pay an APC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of AmeliCA is to support and consolidate a native model that has operated in Latin America for more than 30 years, a model in which the publishing process is financed in a structured and rooted manner with public resources provided via local universities. This is the starting point and our aim is to demonstrate that different models of scholarly publishing have developed than one controlled by commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What has also been happening in our region recently is that journals that have been locally founded and developed – with public resources – and then internationalised, are being acquired by commercial publishers; there are several examples where the publisher is not an academic publisher anymore. These are journals that were created and consolidated with public resources, and then supported by Redalyc for years in order to attain international visibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our view is that this kind of appropriation, and the considerable restrictions researchers now face in order to share, process and publish their work open access, among many other characteristics of the models used by big commercial publishers, are unacceptable for the development of science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The commercial strategies that for-profit publishers have adopted for open access are ravenous, exclusionary and unsustainable. This is entirely contrary to the vision of open access that AmeliCA supports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe that developing a scholarly communication system that is in control of the academy is a much healthier strategy for science and society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it that commercial publishers are a pivotal actor in science communication – in many parts of the world – if most of the activities needed to generate knowledge are undertaken by the academy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why did commercial publishers shift from being the providers of publishing services to the owners of content, and now owners of the tools needed in all stages of the scientific communication process?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which of these various roles is truly beneficial to science?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Free from paywalls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In January, AmeliCA published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kXe1UO4beE&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;directly contrasting the approach being taken by the new European OA initiative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/oa2020-and-coalition-s/&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; with what AmeliCA aims to achieve. The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm&quot;&gt;BBB definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A clear example of this can be seen at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unlp.edu.ar/&quot;&gt;National University of La Plata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; in Argentina. There you can see a very strong, determined, and prepared group already using AmeliCA’s technology to sustain its journals and prevent the implementation of APCs, or the intervention of commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This group is composed of researchers and students and they are being trained in publishing matters in order to sustain the work in the future. Everything is financed with resources from the university and supported by the infrastructure and technology that AmeliCA offers and that Redalyc developed over many years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: AmeliCA is focused primarily on Latin America. More recently, UNESCO announced the launch of the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;. This brings together the coordinators of six platforms: AmeliCA, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajol.info/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;AJOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;É&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;rudit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/&quot;&gt;J-STAGE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openedition.org/?lang=en&quot;&gt;OpenEdition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scielo.org/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, with the aim “to democratize scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”. Aside from the geographical spread of the participants, and the emphasis on language diversity of GLOALL, what distinguishes its aims from those of AmeliCA and Plan S? Is GLOALL more about &lt;/i&gt;articulating&lt;i&gt; an alternative vision to Plan S or are there real-life &lt;/i&gt;practical initiatives&lt;i&gt; planned? If so, what kind of initiatives?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLOALL, in my view, offers the potential for great platforms to work together to create a non-commercial open access future. This need not explicitly oppose commercial publishers but could work from another point of view, one that conceives knowledge as a public common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I should stress that this is my personal view. GLOALL is a new initiative and the scope has yet to be defined. We know that we share common goals and that these need to be realised in the form of policies, projects and strategies, and to be focused on achieving open access aligned with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;established in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/sustainable-development/SDGs/index_en.htm&quot;&gt;United Nations 20130 Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA will willingly share its technology and experience with GLOALL members, and with any region that wishes to strengthen the model we believe in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Three weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://africanopenscience.org.za/&quot;&gt;African Open Science Platform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;joined with cOAlition S (the group of funders behind Plan S) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/&quot;&gt;OA2020&lt;/a&gt; (a European initiative with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/oa2020-and-coalition-s/&quot;&gt;same goals as Plan S&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on Open Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; This was done at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/news/2019-annual-meeting-sao-paulo/&quot;&gt;annual meetin&lt;/a&gt;g &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of the Global Research Council (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/&quot;&gt;GRC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Can you say how this statement came about (i.e. who approached whom?) and how the statement fits with the goals of AmeliCA and GLOALL? How difficult was it to arrive at wording that all sides could agree on? What are the next steps if any?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The question is wrongly posed: AmeliCA didn’t join with either cOAlition S or with OA2020. AmeliCA was invited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/&quot;&gt;Science Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to participate in an event. Several other platforms were invited and together we signed a statement reaffirming the common goal we all share of freeing knowledge from paywalls. This is the goal of dozens and hundreds of platforms. The São Paulo Statement does no more than state that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our concern is not over the goals of Plan S but how they are implemented. The purpose of the meeting we had with the Plan S architects was to discuss that. And at that meeting, I explained our stance (as discussed in the previous questions). I also presented our stance publicly in a panel held at the GRC event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aside from stating that we reject the APC model, I mentioned in that meeting the risk of disrupting the Latin American system by implementing a Eurocentric model, and I resolutely asked why institutions and governments in Latin America would be motivated to continue subsidising scholarly publishing if strategies are put in place that will end up driving more public money to commercial enterprises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I pointed out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. And I asked: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have repeatedly expressed our concerns about Plan S. Now we are waiting for cOAlition S to announce its final implementation plans. We hope that the feedback phase has been useful, and that cOAlition S will adjust their strategy to enable an inclusive, participative open access model to be developed, one in which non-profit scholarly communication is taken into account when financial resources are distributed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If they don’t, Plan S will only further weaken those publishing activities that are still in the control of the academy, and strengthen commercial publishers – to the point perhaps where the former will disappear altogether. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA’s goals are crystal clear: we want scholarly publishing to be in the hands of the academy – universities and professional associations. In other words, to continue working in the way that Redalyc has been working for decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: The wording of the São Paulo Statement is very general and does not specify much in the way of practical action. As you will know, cOAlition S has been struggling to get global buy-in for Plan S, and has attracted criticism in the Global South for attempting to foist a one-size-fits-all Eurocentric model (as you call it) of scholarly publishing on the world. I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement? What benefits do you think signing it might bring to the Global South?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Scholarly publishing is a global ecosystem that already exists. Consequently, for a proposal to be established as global, and for everyone’s benefit, all countries and institutions need to participate in the discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would highlight several points about which I believe there is agreement in the South, although with some nuances: the present model is unsustainable, and knowledge must be freed from paywalls. Every stakeholder agrees with this other than those who benefit from the way things currently are. The only point of disagreement, as I said, is over how open access is achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the South, Redalyc, AmeliCA, CLACSO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latindex.org/latindex/inicio&quot;&gt;Latindex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lareferencia.info/en/&quot;&gt;LaReferencia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (amongst others) have &lt;a href=&quot;http://reuniondeconsorcios.conricyt.mx/index.php/primera-reunion/declaraciones/?lang=en&quot;&gt;expressed their strong objection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to the APC model. And I expressed this clearly and vehemently at São Paolo, so I hope that the final implementation guidelines will demonstrate that cOAlition S has listened to the feedback it has received and is prepared to provide resources for non-profit players. Here I am thinking of non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools. If this happens then our engaging with cOAlition S will have led to something positive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if Plan S ends up dismantling the current harmful system for evaluating research and researchers based on the false prestige bestowed on publications by the Impact Factor – as called for by the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – there is no doubt that the South would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As to any PR benefits the São Paulo Statement may have: I wouldn’t like to think the meeting was only undertaken for media purposes. In signing the statement, we wanted to give a vote of confidence to the notion that communication and feedback between the North and South is a good thing. Plan S and the general public know AmeliCA’s principles and values. We unwaveringly affirm them and will keep working towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I believe AmeliCA plans to publish a public response to the São Paulo Statement. What will be the aim and purpose of that public response and when do you expect to publish it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; We signed the declaration and we shared it. However, I would stress that several platforms signed it, some of which AmeliCA and Redalyc distance themselves from completely. It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together with other institutions AmeliCA and Redalyc are working towards, and hope to further, non-commercial open access (as I have explained) and we resolutely support DORA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal. I would, however, note that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – another regional initiative in Latin America – has signed an agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/&quot;&gt;Clarivate Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. In doing so they have chosen a different route, one that legitimises the Impact Factor as a way of ranking the importance of journals. They have also chosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/products/scholarone/&quot;&gt;ScholarOne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (which is a proprietary Clarivate Analytics product) as their publishing platform in Brazil, rather than the open source software Open Journal Systems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;OJS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; developed by Public Knowledge Project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;PKP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. And they are encouraging the publishing of journals in English over local languages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This interview allows us to take a deeper look at the complexities of these issues, which we’ll also share in a publication on the AmeliCA web site and via other means and forums in the coming days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S may sign general declarations with dozens or hundreds of actors, but it is clear that the real detail and discussion must be found in the “small print” – that is, in the implementation guidelines. We are all waiting for news from Plan S about that. Let’s see how they’ve enriched their understanding and stance after the multiple conversations they have had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Terribly alarming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I sometimes think that OA advocates in the global North have spent 17-odd years working towards a solution that (as AmeliCA puts it) “simply aims to regulate commercial agreements” and are now realising that this approach is creating a system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberquarterly.eu/article/10.18352/lq.10280/&quot;&gt;no more financially sustainable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; than the subscription system. Would you agree? If so, how can this be resolved at this point in time? Might it be too late?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; If the focus of any new initiative is on replacing the model of paying-to-read with one based on paying-to-publish, it will inevitably create an unsustainable and non-inclusive system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is clear is that at this point in time the control of scholarly publishing is in the hands of commercial publishers, and so any planned change must necessarily include them. However, in the process of change control needs to be transferred to academia – to academic institutions, to universities, to academic associations, and to other stakeholders whose focus is on the development of science rather than promoting private commercial interests. And if this is done in a collective manner and in a distributed and fair way the value and power of scholarly communication can be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means building infrastructure, taking advantage of the great benefits that communication and information technologies now offer, professionalising institutions so that they can create a publishing tradition, and anything else that can further the task of taking back control of scholarly communication which is currently dominated by private interests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As things stand, the South cannot escape the perversion of the system. It saddens us to see how more and more national systems of journal assessment disqualify local journals if they don’t rank in the first quartiles of Scopus or Web of Science, no matter how much they have contributed to the history and problem solving of the discipline or region concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a consequence, local journals are now receiving fewer direct resources. And they are receiving fewer contributions because researchers are discouraged from publishing in them. Researchers are discouraged because local journals do not fulfil the requirements needed to be considered “mainstream”, and researchers’ salaries and incentives depend on being published in mainstream journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has happened in Colombia, in Mexico and in many other countries. The agreements between SciELO and Clarivate Analytics, the appropriation of journals by commercial publishers, the hiring of SpringerOpen by public universities to dictate how and where to publish, the list of such examples is vast. Right now, we are looking at an ecosystem at risk of total collapse. And that is terribly alarming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Million-dollar question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Is it in your view possible to build a global system of scholarly communication (and an open-access infrastructure) able to meet the needs of all countries in a fair and equitable way, both countries &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in the Global South and those in the Global North? If so, what might it look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; That is the million-dollar question. Thank you for asking, and for thinking that I could provide even the draft of an answer. Undoubtedly, that is what we all want, and because of that we gather together and debate the issue. But let me share my viewpoint on that with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to start by asking: what science communication model or paradigm can be considered a suitable one for humanity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not necessarily a matter of South or North. We must go back to basics and recover the essence of what science communication is and should be. Is it to communicate research, and to do so to the limit of what is possible in order to attain the greatest efficacy and efficiency in putting scientific and technological advances at society’s disposal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We must remind ourselves that the goal of publishing is to make our research available for the public, to submit findings to public scrutiny, and to do so in a way that allows everyone to access knowledge without restriction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to facilitate a global conversation that focuses on both the large and small problems humanity faces and to ensure that all researchers are able to participate in that conversation, not only those who can pay to take part in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current information technologies enable us to rethink what is now taken for granted. We can deconstruct what we know does not work and we can decide what engine is needed to further the agendas and work of researchers. And we can be more creative in planning how to distribute resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many efforts have been made to do this around the world, there hasn’t yet been enough determination and resources put into uniting these isolated and disparate efforts. Open access and scholarly communication find themselves at a key historical moment and we are now in a position, and have a great opportunity, to redraw the system of scholarly communication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I imagine a web of data for science, a knowledge cloud – sustainable and open – that promotes a participatory and inclusive science communication system, one in which every institution that is generating knowledge is able to connect it into a giant graph of knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to do that I strongly believe that academic institutions must not only be the generators – as it were – of this asset, but also the owners and transmitters of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for answering my questions.

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Journals Now OPEN for Published Peer Review</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8cOKqikbOOA/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/5-690x3202-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Starting today, ALL PLOS journals will offer authors the option to publish their peer review history alongside their accepted manuscript! We’ve been excited to make this announcement, and make major strides towards a more open publication process, since last fall when we signed ASAPbio’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/letter&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; committing to transparent peer review options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will it look like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our philosophy going into this project has been to open up the peer review process in a way that gives authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As before, our peer review process defaults to single-blind, although reviewers have the option to sign their names to their reviews if they wish. What we’ve added to our process is an option at acceptance for authors to decide whether to publish the full peer review history alongside their work. This package includes the editor’s full decision letter, complete with reviewer comments and authors’ responses for each revision of the manuscript. Peer review history will have its own DOI enabling reviewers to take credit and earn citations for their contributions. If the reviewers have chosen to sign their reviews, their name will also appear on the published reviews but they can also chose to remain anonymous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;All manuscripts submitted after May 22, 2019 will be eligible for this option if accepted at a PLOS Journal. Here’s a look at the variations of open our opt-in model provides:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8582&quot; height=&quot;1452&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A major step for PLOS, and scholarly communication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The peer review history reveals crucial perspectives and decisions that supply additional context for readers and researchers. Because of the potential benefits, we’re making this option available &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on all seven PLOS journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other journals that have experimented with published peer review models have shown that the quality of feedback provided is at least as good as other models – we think it has the potential to be even better through increased accountability and transparency. We’re building off the foundations and lessons learned by these examples and are confident our model can offer authors more choices to make their research and the publishing process open, and showcase the rigorous review of their work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through the scale of our publishing output across all seven PLOS journals, we see this as an opportunity to make a significant change in the scholarly communication landscape and lay the foundation for a more open view of the manuscript handling process from start to finish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open beyond Open Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the benefits of transparency are numerous, we see published peer review as a crucial first step towards solving two fundamental problems: reviewer credit and public understanding of the peer review process. So far, Open Access has made it possible for research to reach a global community of readers but we have not yet demonstrated the work that goes on behind the scenes to validate scientific claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Publishing peer review history is a means of enriching the scientific record by giving context to evaluation and publication decisions. We hope this is also an important step toward elevating peer reviews to scholarly outputs in their own right that reviewers can take credit for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In conjunction with the work it describes, peer review history can also be a source of material for educating students and the general public about peer review. Our content is also machine readable, paving the way for deeper analysis and discussion by the community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’ve developed this option in consultation with our editors who are dedicated to improving our journals, and we also committed to reporting back our findings. As we learn more about how published peer review shapes author and reviewer choices, and reader experience, we’ll continue to update you on what we find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hikikomori is a dark term that describes people who stay holed up in their homes, or even just their bedrooms, isolated from everyone except their family, for many months or years. The phenomenon has captured the popular imagination with many articles appearing in the mainstream media in recent years, but, surprisingly, it isn’t well understood by psychologists.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition was first described in Japan, but cases have since been reported in countries as far apart as Oman, Indian, the US and Brazil. No one knows how many hikikomori exist (the term refers both to the condition and the people with it), but surveys suggest that 1.79 per cent of Japanese people aged 15-39 meet the criteria. However, while some assumptions about risk factors have been made, based largely on reports of specific cases, there has been a lack of population-based research. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00247/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_969842_68_Psychi_20190423_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, plugs some of the knowledge gaps.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37194&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseline Yong and Kyoko Nomura analysed survey data from 3,287 male and female participants aged 15-39, who were randomly selected from 200 different urban and suburban municipalities all over Japan, representing a cross-section of Japanese society.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants answered questions about how often they left their home (and for those who didn’t, how long they’d remained inside). Researchers classified as hikikomori anyone who, for at least the past six months, never or rarely left their home, unless they had a practical reason for staying in, such as being pregnant, being busy doing housework (yes, really), they were a homemaker, or they had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The respondents also answered demographic questions and questions about their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that hikikomori is primarily an urban phenomenon. But that’s not what Yong and Nomura found. Based on the survey data, 1.8 per cent of the respondents were hikikomori, but they were just as likely to live in a village as in a big city. The condition has also been considered more common among men, and this study provides the first epidemiological evidence to back this up. Still, 20 of the 58 hikikomori were female.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yong and Nomura found no relationship with country region, number of family members or social class. But one local demographic variable did stand out as being protective: living in an area filled with businesses and shops.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hikikomori in the sample were more likely to have a history of psychiatric treatment, to have dropped out of school and to have a tendency towards violence to themselves (self-harming, for instance), but not to others. However, the most significant and strongest factor was a high level of interpersonal difficulties, as measured by the degree of agreement with questionnaire items like “I am anxious about the possibility of meeting people that I know”, “I am anxious about what others might think of me”, and “I cannot blend into groups”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yong and Nomura write: “These anxieties may be related to a sense of humiliation, which suggests that they are afraid of being seen in their current situation….Unlike anxieties found in social phobias or generalised social anxieties…. our finding of an association between hikikomori and interpersonal difficulties indicates that hikikomori fear people and the community that they know.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does suggest a possible route to treatment: “By carefully assessing the types of fears that they may have, our data suggest the possibility that improving communication skills and managing expectations may be helpful for combating hikikomori.” They note that this type of strategy has in fact already been tried, with some success.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if these anxieties are keeping people inside their homes, what’s prompting them to retreat there in the first place? The survey also revealed that hikikomori are more likely to have dropped out of high school or university. Perhaps finding ways to keep young people in education may, then, reduce the risk.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that a very high percentage – 37.9 per cent – of the hikikomori had a previous history of psychiatric treatment. “The higher proportion of hikikomori who are dependent on medication is also alarming,” the researchers add.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How all these factors may inter-relate, as causes or perhaps results of hikikomori, is far from clear. As the researchers stress, further studies are clearly needed. However, this new work does provide some good pointers to the research avenues most worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
