&lt;p&gt;In the UK, more and more of our children are learning mindfulness at school. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindfulnessinschools.org&quot;&gt;Mindfulness in Schools&lt;/a&gt; project claims that over 4000 of our teachers are now trained in the practice. However, some experts are concerned that the roll-out of mindfulness has raced ahead of the evidence base, which paints a mixed picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796716300389&quot;&gt;recent failure&lt;/a&gt; to find any benefits of a school mindfulness programme for teenagers (contrary to some earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23787061&quot;&gt;more positive findings&lt;/a&gt;), a research team led by Catherine Johnson at Flinders University has now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671730181X&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the results of their latest school trial, which included new features in the mindfulness intervention, such as parental involvement and better designed homework materials, intended to maximise the programme’s effectiveness. However, once again the mindfulness programme led to no observable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30003&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine-week Mindfulness Programme used in the current trial was based on the popular &lt;em&gt;.b&lt;/em&gt; Mindfulness in School’s curriculum, which features various elements, including: the eponymous “stop and be” (.b) technique that involves stopping, feeling your feet, feeling your breathing and being present; training in how to be more mindful in everyday activities; and relaxation practices. Daily practice at home was encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and seventy-eight teenagers from four urban schools in Australia were allocated to take part in the weekly 40- to 60-minute training sessions. About half of this group took part in a version of the programme that actively involved their parents, through an initial parents’ evening session and the receipt of weekly Youtube clips of their child’s training sessions. Another 182 teens from the same schools acted as controls and did not participate in any of the mindfulness classes. The average age of the participating pupils was 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with earlier trials, the mindfulness programme included additional elements designed to maximise engagement and the chances for the programme being a success. This included asking teachers to participate alongside their pupils, providing teachers with audio files for practising techniques with their pupils outside of the formal sessions, and improved course materials such as colourful classroom posters and quizzes. The mindfulness training was delivered by the trial’s lead author who is a highly experienced mindfulness practitioner and trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participating pupils completed a wide range of psychological measures at baseline, after the nine-week programme was complete, and again at six- and 12-month follow up, including questionnaires tapping their levels of anxiety and depression, their concerns with their weight, their overall wellbeing, and their levels of everyday mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who completed the mindfulness programme showed no benefits on any measure, either immediately or after the programme or at follow-up. It made no difference whether they were in the version of the programme that included parental engagement (participation by parents was extremely poor – only 8 per cent attended the initial evening session – prompting the researchers to suggest this approach may be a poor use of resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results may not surprise readers who are sceptical of all the hype around mindfulness. The researchers, who are mindfulness enthusiasts, wonder if perhaps the early teen years are not the optimum time to teach mindfulness. “Despite the added capacity [compared with younger kids] for abstract thought to allow skills such as metacognition to unfold, perhaps more ‘cynical’ early adolescents require increased life challenges before the relevance of socioemotional tools becomes evident,” they said, adding: “Further research is required to identify the optimal age, content and length of programs delivering mindfulness to adolescents”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671730181X&quot;&gt;A randomized controlled evaluation of a secondary school mindfulness program for early adolescents: Do we have the recipe right yet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/nutrient-activated-tor-proteins-regulate-cell-growth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was given to Michael N. Hall for discovery of and investigations into “nutrient-activated TOR proteins and their central role in the metabolic control of cell growth.” TOR (Target of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein and a central regulator through its role as a nutrient sensor, coupling nutrient availability to protein synthesis and cell growth. A critical signaling protein, TOR forms multiprotein associations that function as distinct clusters, either as TORC1 (TOR Complex 1) or TORC2 (TOR Complex 2), depending upon those additional proteins. In their 2007 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, Hall and colleagues &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;identified novel TOR interacting proteins specific for each complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, investigating the role of phosphorylation and complex function for each. More recently, work from the Hall group published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; demonstrated a role for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TORC1 in bone formation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and, in yeast cells, characterized the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signaling state of the TORC1 complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with the use of antibody tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/hpv-vaccines-cancer-prevention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was jointly awarded to John Schiller and Douglas Lowy for their collaborative efforts, innovations and ”technological advances that enabled development of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for prevention of cervical cancer and other tumors caused by human papillomaviruses.” Papillomavirus infection on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals can cause benign warts (papillomas) or malignancies, especially anogenital carcinomas, and in genetically predisposed or immunocompromised individuals can cause skin cancer. Development of safe and effective vaccines has potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and other malignancies resulting from HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schiller and Lowry collaborated on three articles published with PLOS. In the early days of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, they demonstrated that carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from red algae, was an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extremely potent infection inhibitor for sexually transmitted genital HPVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Their most recent joint publication (also in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigates papillomavirus in various mouse models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, to gain insights into immune system influences on infection progression in humans. These articles, together with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068329&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;results of a clinical trial of bivalent HPV vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have received nearly 83,000 views.

	<content:encoded>Get your earplugs ready because this post is metal. Last week, a group of neuroscientists published a paper reporting altered brain activity in heavy metal lovers.



The paper raised a few eyebrows, not least for its statement that metal fans show &quot;disorders of behavioral and emotional cognition.&quot; It's already attracted some convincing critical comments on PubPeer. To my mind, the paper is a perfect example of a flawed neuroimaging study.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of psychiatry’s principal diagnostic manual (the DSM-V) defines Hoarding Disorder as a psychopathology where the collection of items significantly impacts the person’s functioning, as they find it difficult and indeed painful to discard the items, creating congestion within the home and encouraging poor hygiene and accidents. However not only objects, but also living things can be collected pathologically, popularly enshrined in the notion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_lady&quot;&gt;a “cat lady”&lt;/a&gt;. According to the psychiatric manual, this is just a special case of hoarding. But a team of psychologists from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has investigated people who hoard animals, and in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117301518&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/i&gt; they make the case that it ought to be considered a distinct illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30401&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa Arrienti Ferreira and her colleagues investigated animal hoarding cases in the city of Porto Alegre, following up a survey conducted by the city’s Secretariat for Animal Rights. Of 75 potential cases, they managed to reach residents in 48 dwellings, and from those, found 33 who agreed to participate and fit the diagnostic criteria for the animal subtype of hoarding. The team arrived with vets to check the conditions of animals, they also surveyed the conditions of the residence and interviewed the animal hoarders about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions in which these people lived might be hard to take in: there were a total of 1,357 animals – “composed of 915 dogs, 382 cats, and 50 ducks” – with an average of 41 per hoarder. Only 22 per cent ensured their animals were neutered, and the sanitary and health conditions were often very poor. The researchers also report that “dramatic situations such as violent fights for territory, extreme malnutrition, cannibalism, caged animals injured and untreated, were observed in most of the houses visited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of the hoarders were elderly, but they’d all begun accumulating animals earlier in their lives. Ferreira’s team speculate that it’s only later in life when the burden of animal collection becomes most apparent, as the number proliferate due to the individual’s reluctance to give animals away. Two-thirds of animal hoarders were women, and most lived alone, consistent with the sense that the animals provided companionship and comfort to people who otherwise struggle to form relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a two main reasons why Ferreira’s team advocate for this to be considered as separate from standard hoarding. First, some of the technical definition of hoarding just seems off: take the concept of “congestion”, which makes sense in a house piled precariously high with magazines or wine bottles, but doesn’t really apply to mobile creatures. Second, the researchers note that their sample also seemed to show more self-awareness than is associated with object hoarding, many admitting to difficulties that resulted from their compulsion, and recognising that it took a toll on their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they see the problem, why don’t the animal hoarders do something about it? Well, it’s harder to rid yourself of an animal than trash, both logistically and emotionally. The presence of care-bonding with living things transforms the dynamic, and would suggest that the tactics appropriate for managing an item-hoarder may simply not apply in these cases. The researchers conclude that distinguishing animal hoarding as its own mental health condition can lead to investment into interventions that address a disorder that “causes serious damage to the environment, suffering for individuals, their families, and the animals.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Comparing sexual harassment from clients or customers to harassment from other employees</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/25/comparing-sexual-harassment-from-clients-or-customers-to-harassment-from-other-employees/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/iStock_000019033862Large-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment at work includes unwanted verbal, non-verbal and physical sexual behaviors. Previous research shows that sexual harassment can lead to decreased job satisfaction and lower mental health, including more depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we started a research project focusing specifically on sexual harassment conducted by customers and clients (including patients). The research project included a cross sectional study on the relation between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms. The study draws on data from 7,603 Danish employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this relevant? The phenomenon has received very little attention in research and practice, although clients and customers are more likely to be the source of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 7,603 employees in our study, 2.4% (180) reported exposure to sexual harassment from clients or customers during the last 12 months. In comparison, 1.0% (79) were harassed by other employees (including colleagues, supervisors and subordinates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence was markedly higher among women in care work with 152 out 2,191 (6.9%) reporting exposure to sexual harassment from clients or customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me these numbers underline the need to investigate sexual harassment by clients and patients further. The question is – are we talking about the same phenomenon? Or does it matter who the perpetrator is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to employees who were not harassed, employees harassed by clients or customers scored 2.05 points higher on the major depression Inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our primary research questions was therefore to examine if the negative effects depend on whether the perpetrator is a client /customer or another employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyses revealed two important findings. First, compared to employees who were not harassed, employees harassed by clients or customers scored 2.05 points higher on the major depression Inventory (MDI) – a self-reported mood questionnaire that generates a diagnosis of depression and an estimate of symptom severity. Scores of 20 points or more are considered as an indicator for a probable depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we measured depression and exposure to sexual harassment at the same time, we cannot draw conclusions on cause and effect. Nevertheless, the findings support the notion that sexual harassment from clients and customers is associated with more depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, much to our surprise, employees harassed by other employees scored 2.45 points higher on the MDI compared to employees who had experienced sexual harassment by clients or customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these findings underline a need to consider sexual harassment by clients/customers and sexual harassment by other employees as two distinct types of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the research project, we have also conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260613&quot;&gt;qualitative study on sexual harassment in care work&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from this suggests that sexual harassment from patients is a taboo, and that employees consider the harassment an inherent part of their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many instances patients do not harass the employees deliberately and cannot be held accountable for their actions, for instance when the inappropriate sexual behaviors is a result of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualitative study also showed, that -in practice, separating between intentional and unintentional harassment is complex and not straightforward. This therefore constitutes a specific dilemma for employees exposed to sexual harassment from patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I find that it is prudent to put sexual harassment from customers and clients on the agenda – especially in the workplace. We need to break the taboo and stop normalizing sexual harassment by patients as a part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a signature of sexual commitment in malaria parasites</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/CceMp9pYgsA/nature24280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Pathogens have to balance transmission with persistence. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent malaria parasite, persistence within its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells (RBCs), while its mosquito-borne transmission depends on intra-erythrocytic differentiation into non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes1. Commitment to either fate is determined during the preceding cell cycle that begins with invasion by a single, asexually-committed merozoite and ends, 48 hours later, with a schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, all committed to either continued asexual replication or differentiation into gametocytes2,3. Sexual commitment requires activation of ap2-g (PF3D7_1222600)4,5, the transcriptional master regulator of sexual development, from an epigenetically silenced state during asexual replication6,7. AP2-G expression during this ‘commitment cycle’ poises gene expression in nascent merozoites to initiate sexual development through a hitherto unknown mechanism2,4. In order to maintain a persistent infection, ap2-g expression is limited to a sub-population of parasites (1-30%, depending on genetic background and growth conditions). As sexually-committed schizonts comprise only a sub-population and are morphologically indistinguishable from their asexually-committed counterparts, defining their characteristic gene expression has been difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling8. To determine the transcriptional changes induced by AP2-G within this sub-population, we applied highly-parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)9 to malaria cultures undergoing sexual commitment. In this first application of scRNA-seq to eukaryotic pathogens, we surveyed over 18,000 single parasite transcriptomes from a conditional AP2-G knockdown (AP2-G-DD) line and NF54 wild-type parasite at multiple stages of development (Fig. 1A, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1) and found that sexually committed, AP2-G+ mature schizonts specifically up-regulate additional regulators of gene expression, including other AP2 transcription factors, histone modifying enzymes, and regulators of nucleosome positioning. These epigenetic regulators likely act to poise the expression/repression of genes necessary for the initiation of gametocyte development in the subsequent cell cycle.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Older Age, Dementia, and Circadian Rhythms</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/22/older-age-dementia-and-circadian-rhythms/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that sleep patterns change with age. Older people tend to sleep less, their sleep can be shallow and fragmented. Often they sleep very little at night, spending few hours in bed during the daytime. The problem becomes serious in older people suffering from dementia, especially from the caretaker’s perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered several brain processes that influence these sleeping pattern changes. One particularly interesting finding from this research (which may also inform approaches for addressing the problem) is the finding that light exposure has serious effects on the circadian rhythm in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our visual sensory system performs two major tasks: the gathering and processing of visual information (the visual response), and the control of the biological clock that regulates the production of several important hormones (the non-visual response). The majority of living organisms have a non-visual response to the day-night cycle, where body functions adjust to specific periods within a 24 hour day (circadian cycle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms regulate the sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, hormone release (e.g., melatonin and cortisol), and gene expression. Circadian rhythms are not set in stone and have to be fine-tuned to the actual experience of the timing and duration of day and night, which are subject to seasonal changes and geographic location. The importance of synchronized circadian regulation is obvious if we consider the physiological and behavioral disruptions caused by jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, our eyes were discovered to have a specific photosensitive cell type named intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that are primarily involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. These cells are sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths with maximal light absorption at blue light wavelengths of around 480 nm. It is believed that ipRGCs are tuned to the dominant wavelength of light at twilight. During twilight (i.e., at dawn and dusk) the sun is close to the horizon and there is a relative enrichment of ‘blue’ light in the dome of the sky because of the preferential scattering of short wavelengths of light passing obliquely through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signals from ipRGCs are processed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus that is considered the key circadian pacemaker in the brain. The suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates the release of melatonin, a hormone crucial to the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, with blue light stimulating the most powerful changes in the melatonin secretion rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual and non-visual systems respond differently to the quantity of light and timing of light exposure. The quantity of polychromatic white light necessary to activate the non-visual circadian system is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the amount that activates the visual system. The reaction time of two systems is also different: while the visual system responds to a light stimulus very quickly (in milliseconds), the duration of light exposure needed to affect the circadian system can take minutes. The effects of light on the circadian system depends on the infusion of melatonin into the bloodstream, increasing the response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How circadian rhythms get affected with advanced age?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sensitivity to light stimuli reduces with the age. Multiple studies demonstrate that neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is reduced in the elderly, especially after the age of 80, and circadian rhythm amplitude is also reduced after the age of 50. This means that the intensity of the response of the non-visual system to light stimuli is reduced, sometimes very substantially. The direct consequence of this muted response is the lack of proper regulation and adjustment of circadian rhythms to the day/night cycle. Disturbances in circadian rhythms leading to poor sleep in older adults can be the result of dysfunctional circadian pathways or a pathway that cannot process light information with as much fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage of phototransduction (when light signals are converted into neural signals) is negatively affected in older people: older adults have reduced optical transmission at short wavelengths that are maximally effective for the regulation of circadian system (i.e., blue light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults also tend to lead a more sedentary indoor lifestyle, with less access to bright light during the day, potentially increasing the risk for circadian disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well-established that visual task performance improves with increased light levels, regardless of age. However, the need for light for visual task performance increases with age due to age-related losses in retinal illumination. These losses are reasonably uniform over time, with a 10% loss per ten years of aging. Thus, a ninety-year-old would require ten times the light of a 10-year-old for similar photoreception. The effect on circadian rhythmicity is further exacerbated with age because the shorter violet and blue wavelengths (400–500 nm) are most affected by yellowing of the aging eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth keeping in mind that older people often have reduced eyesight, suffer from blurred vision, and may have age-related eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How circadian rhythms get affected in neurological conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer’s disease and similar conditions may affect multiple parts of the brain, including the parts involved in regulation of circadian rhythms. In Alzheimer’s disease, the suprachiasmatic nucleus deteriorates, contributing to alterations in circadian rhythms. This deterioration exacerbates the age-related loss of neuronal activity in the nucleus. Sleep disturbances, agitated behaviour, and depression are very common in people suffering from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be done to counteract these negative changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright light therapy has emerged as one of the most harmless and effective approaches to manage sleep disturbances in elderly people and patients with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have demonstrated that increased exposure to bright light may increase the amplitude of circadian rhythms, i.e., clearly enhances the intensity of the response to daily 24-hour cycles. Bright light exposure during the morning or evenings may help in consolidating circadian rhythms. Additionally, increased exposure to blue light may be beneficial, as photoreceptors in ipRGCs are more easily activated at these wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The points above were incorporated into the development of a number of experimental light therapies aimed at stimulating the normal functioning of the non-visual system in the elderly and people with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light therapy may be delivered in a variety of ways, such as using a light box placed approximately one meter away from the participants at a height within their visual field; a headworn light visor; ceiling mounted light fixtures; or naturalistic light therapy—known as dawn-dusk simulation—that mimics outdoor twilight transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published research data suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be reversed by stimulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus with light. Clinical research has shown that light therapy can consolidate rest and activity patterns in people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a diverse choice of various electric light sources these days, and with proper selection, a balanced and circadian-effective lighting regime can be achieved in spaces with insufficient daylight illumination. The spectral characteristics and intensity of electric lights should be adjusted to the time of the day. Currently, the LED Luminaire™ is being developed that auto-tunes interior lighting to mimic the full spectrum of natural daylight throughout the day, with characteristics that can be “tuned” for older adults. This would provide quality illumination for visual tasks and help synchronize biological rhythms for better health, cognitive ability, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marine Ecology at the Coral Reef Ecosystems Laboratory at the University of Queensland in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lab I work in is interested in all things coral reefs. We study a variety of key reef organisms on the genetic, physiological and ecological level, we examine their roles on coral reefs and we assess how these ecosystems are responding to climate change. My Ph.D. research, in particular, focuses on a specific type of sponges, namely bioeroding sponges, which excavate and inhabit coral skeletons often killing the coral in the process. My project aims to understand the metabolic dynamics of sponge bioerosion on the present and future coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my studies I was lucky enough to visit a tropical coral reef, and then I was hooked. I won’t pretend that what drew my interest was the importance of coral reefs for global marine biodiversity, their productivity and the livelihoods they support, or the significant ecosystem goods and services they provide as I had learned in the classroom. At the time, it was just the plain beauty of the place. Years later this ecosystem still has so much to teach me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I owe this interest to my auntie’s coffee table – there was always some wildlife magazine laying around. As an undergraduate student, my involvement with the amateur photography group of the University of Crete (Greece) was a great inspiration. Wildlife and landscapes are still my favorite picture subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken during working hours at Harry’s Bommie on Heron Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef in Australia in February 2016. My colleagues and I were on scuba hanging in the water column in between sampling times for a coral physiology experiment we were conducting just a few meters away. I saw the octopus from the corner of my eye. It saw me too and instantly transformed itself into a coral, in shape and color. It wasn’t fast enough to hide, so instead, it froze in place. I couldn’t have wished for an easier, more stable shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heron Island is a small coral cay near the Tropic of Capricorn and it is surrounded by a fringing platform reef. The University of Queensland runs a small research station on the island. The station is frequented by marine and terrestrial researchers who come to conduct their work at this relatively untouched offshore site. Together with my colleagues, we perform most of our field-work and experiments on Heron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs are underwater forests formed over years by the slow build-up of coral skeletons. What makes them special is that thanks to the partnership between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates, coral reefs can thrive in shallow sunlit waters that would otherwise be too poor nutritionally to sustain such biodiverse ecosystems. Multiple other life forms are housed in the complex framework that corals build. The image exemplifies how some of the smartest residents of reefs use the habitat to shelter and camouflage against predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, an octopus is in itself a photogenic creature. But the camouflaging behavior it exhibited with the coral in the background was even more worth a shot. At the time, in the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef abnormally high seawater temperatures were pushing the symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates beyond all limits. The reef was undergoing a mass coral bleaching event. Down south at Heron corals were spared the heat, yet I couldn’t help but wonder what the fate of such an octopus would be -or the fate of various other fauna- on a bleached or dead reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling positive emotions is good for your physical health, right? There’s certainly evidence in support of the idea. But it’s mostly come from studies of people living in Western countries. Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797617713309&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, concludes that for people in Japan, it may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While positive emotions, like happiness, are seen as a good thing in the US, UK, and elsewhere in Europe, the picture is different in east Asia: they aren’t seen being as necessarily desirable, and negative emotions aren’t considered to be all that bad. As the researchers, led by Jiah Yoo at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US, write in their introduction: “No study to date has directly compared the biological correlates of positive affect across cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30373&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied 1,017 men and women living in America, and 374 men and women in Japan (selected to be representative of the general population). The participants rated how frequently they had felt each of 10 positive emotions over the past 30 days (including happiness, cheerfulness, “calm and peaceful”, “full of life” and proud). They also gave blood samples, which were checked for levels of HDL-cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol). An unhealthy cholesterol profile increases the risk of heart disease – the world’s biggest killer – but can be improved through exercise and healthy eating, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers controlled statistically for the influence of age, gender and years of education – all known to be linked to cholesterol profiles – and negative emotions over the past month (to be sure that positive emotions were associated with cholesterol independently of these demographic factors or negative emotions). They also measured participants’ smoking, alcohol consumption, healthy eating, and body mass index (BMI) to see if these were relevant to any potential links between emotion and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Americans in the study, experiencing higher levels of positive emotions was indeed associated with having a healthier cholesterol profile, so much so, in fact, as to be clinically significant. But there was no such association whatsoever for the Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers dug further into the data they found that the cultural difference in the association between positive emotions and cholesterol was, to a large extent, related to body mass index (BMI). Americans, but not Japanese, who felt more positive emotions also tended to have a lower BMI, which might explain their lower cholesterol – people who are not overweight generally have a healthier cholesterol profile. There was also evidence that Americans who had a lower BMI and felt more positive emotions did more exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded: “These results are consistent with a theoretical prediction that a good fit between one’s emotions and one’s culturally prescribed values and beliefs may motivate a healthier lifestyle. Frequent experience of positive affect in the Western context would be aligned with prescribed values and beliefs and thus likely motivate engagement in and pursuit of healthy behaviours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are other possible explanations. For example, perhaps Americans who exercise are more likely to feel more positive emotions, be of healthy weight, and therefore enjoy a healthier cholesterol profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from national data, only 3.6 per cent of the Japanese participants would have been obese, compared with 32 per cent of the Americans. With less variation in BMI in the Japanese sample, it would have been harder to spot any links between BMI and positive emotion. While the researchers argue that differences in cultural attitudes to positive emotion explain their data, more research is certainly needed to support their interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Possible effects of raising tobacco taxes across the EU</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/21/possible-effects-of-raising-tobacco-taxes-across-the-eu/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/non-smoking-2367409_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European Union (EU), approximately 700,000 people die of smoking-related diseases every year. The reduction of tobacco consumption has thus become one of the major social policies of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tobacco control policies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/en/&quot;&gt;MPOWER&lt;/a&gt;) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008 serve as a guideline for the health authorities of the EU member states. The six MPOWER measures mandate (i) increases in the tobacco tax; (ii) monitoring of tobacco usage; (iii) support for quitters; (iv) creation of a smoking-free environment; (v) warning against the dangers of tobacco; (vi) and banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the MPOWER measures, taxation is the most common single policy tool to control tobacco use. Economic theory suggests that increasing tobacco taxes will result in higher direct costs for smokers and thus lower consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the tobacco industry could absorb the additional costs to prevent higher retail prices, but, in reality, increased costs are passed on to the consumers. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption, while others switch to lower-priced products or turn to smuggled goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling a 10% tax increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we estimated the effects of a hypothetical cigarette price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and death toll of smoking in 28 EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous studies, our statistical model also accounted for the fact that income affects the responsiveness of consumers to price changes. Research has shown that smokers with high disposable income are less affected by rising cigarette prices than those with lower income. In other words, the price elasticity of demand changes with income (income threshold effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price elasticity of demand is used to measure changes in demand of goods in response to changes in price. It gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our statistical model separates the observed 28 countries into three income clusters (regimes), assuming that all of the countries within a cluster have about the same response patterns to price increases. Using data for the years 2005 to 2014, our model estimated the price elasticity of each income cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the elasticity figures, we were able to estimate the possible effects of a hypothetical price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and the number of averted smoking-attributable deaths. The latter figure derived from the simulated impact of price increments on the reduction in smokers and was adjusted for the fact that smoking cessation still carries considerable risks of early death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of our study revealed that higher taxation would be considerably more effective in reducing consumption as well as incidences of smoking-related deaths in the two less developed regimes than in the remaining 24 countries (EU24) belonging to the third income regime. Specifically, nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other measures, such as bans on tobacco advertising, taxation not only effectively decreases tobacco consumption but, in general, also has the beneficial side effect of increasing national tax revenues. Our simulation showed that although tax revenues increased by 7.03% in Latvia and Poland, and by 3.15% in the EU24 area, revenues dropped by 1.41% in the least developed countries, Bulgaria and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different policies for different countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the policy implications? As the results of the study show, there are three income regimes among the observed 28 European countries. Since each regime is differently affected by cigarette taxation, different policies must be adopted to fight nicotine use. Specifically, other measures to control tobacco use, such as restrictions on advertisements, pictorial warning labels and cessation assistance, are necessary in high-income countries to compensate for the income threshold effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as the study has shown, higher taxation leads to significant increases in tax revenues in high-income regimes, but in poorer countries it is more likely to lead to considerable losses in tax revenues. Health authorities in less developed countries may thus lack crucial funding to implement anti-smoking measures. External funding (donations from other European countries) would thus be required to ensure success in combating cigarette use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illicit trade of tobacco products has not been included in the study, as reliable data could not be obtained for all countries. Moreover, data on cigarette consumption analysed in this study refer to factory-made (FM) cigarettes. Roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco products have become popular in the EU in recent years and may influence consumption behavior. Further research on price effects may thus address the issue of illicit trade and RYO cigarette use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia complains of serious memory problems, sometimes even forgetting who they are, without there being any apparent physical reason for their symptoms – in other words, their condition seems to be purely psychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating, controversial diagnosis with roots dating back to Freud’s, Breuer’s and Charcot’s ideas about hysteria and how emotional problems sometimes manifest in dramatic physical ways. Today, some experts doubt that psychogenic amnesia is a real phenomenon, reasoning that there is either an undetected physical cause or the patient is fabricating their memory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/9/2498/4080831/Psychogenic-amnesia-syndromes-outcome-and-patterns&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, a team of British neuropsychologists has reported their findings from a study of 53 patients diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia – one of the largest ever studies of its kind. Michael Kopelman at Kings College, London, and his colleagues conclude that the prognosis (that is, the scope and speed of recovery) for psychogenic amnesia is better than previously realised and that there appear to be four main categories of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30107&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients with psychogenic amnesia were all patients at St Thomas’s Hospital in London between 1990 and 2008, and the researchers compared their memory functioning and clinical history with 21 patients with memory disorders with a known physical cause (such as early stage Alzheimer’s or hypoxia), and 14 healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients with psychogenic amnesia fell into four distinct categories. There were those who were in a &lt;strong&gt;fugue state&lt;/strong&gt;, who had been wandering lost for days with no recollection of who they are or their past life. “I had a breakdown,” said one patient. “My brain decided to close down. I felt as if placed into a grown-up body without knowing the history of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon neurological examination, the fugue patients appeared healthy, and their state usually returned to normal within four weeks, though usually sooner, and sometimes within hours. After recovery, most of their memories returned, except for a blank gap during the fugue state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second category was &lt;strong&gt;fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia&lt;/strong&gt;. These patients started out in a fugue state – lost and usually with no or little memory of their past and no sense of identity – then as the fugue state resolved, they were left with more persistent memory loss for large periods of their past lives. Their memory gaps seemed to take longer to recover than the fugue patients (sometimes never recovering), though with a relative sparing of more recent memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third category was &lt;strong&gt;focal retrograde amnesia&lt;/strong&gt;. These patients had a severe loss of memory for large periods of their lives, or their entire lives, sometimes a temporary loss of identity, but there was no fugue period involving wandering. The onset was often a mild neurological event (such as a minor stroke) or minor head injury, but one “insufficient to account for the severity of the retrograde memory loss”. Similar to the fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia category, these patients’ memory loss was more prolonged than the fugue patients, but with a relative sparing of more recent memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, some of the patients fell into a category the researchers called “&lt;strong&gt;gaps in memory&lt;/strong&gt;” – they didn’t have a wandering period, loss of personal identity was also rare, and their one or more periods of memory loss were discrete, often tied to a specific traumatic experience (and often associated with PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At six months follow up, the fugue patients and to a lesser extent, the focal retrograde amnesia patients, showed good improvement. “In summary, the prognosis in psychogenic amnesia appears better than the previous literature suggests,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the psychogenic patients with the neurological and healthy controls, the psychogenic group were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to have suffered a past head injury (though not of sufficient seriousness to explain their memory problems); they were more likely to have a diagnosis of depression; to have a history of family or relationship problems, or employment problems; problems in childhood; and/or a history of alcohol or drug problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding that the psychogenic patients were more likely to have a history of head injury than the neurological controls is particularly surprising. Kopelman’s team said “this may predispose some individuals to developing psychogenic amnesia at a later time of severe precipitating crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A debate about psychogenic amnesia that dates back to Freud is whether the process of memory loss is deliberate or subconscious. Kopelman and his team observed that their findings were more consistent with there being a conscious, deliberate element to the condition (as first proposed by Freud and Josef Breuer, though Freud later changed his position). For instance, some of the patients in the new study made comments like: “It’s like a box locked away, and I don’t really want to open it” and “I put things in boxes … I know the memories are there … but cannot get access to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current thinking of Kopelman and others is that the deliberate memory suppression of psychogenic amnesia is often brought about by stressful crises in life, and that the deliberate forgetting manifests in genuine neurological processes that really do interfere with memory and even personal identity. Kopelman and his team conclude by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045208/&quot;&gt;quoting&lt;/a&gt; the Cambridge University psychologists Michael Anderson and Simon Hanslmayr: “Control mechanisms mediated by the prefrontal cortex interrupt mnemonic function and impair memory … We are … conspirators in our own forgetting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/9/2498/4080831/Psychogenic-amnesia-syndromes-outcome-and-patterns&quot;&gt;Psychogenic amnesia: syndromes, outcome, and patterns of retrograde amnesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Founded in May 2017 by Clifford Woolf, Professor of Neurology and Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, Kevin Eggan, Professor of Regenerative Biology at Harvard, Kasper Roet, Harvard Research Fellow, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/q-state-biosciences&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Q-State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Biosciences, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/quralis-corporation/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;QurAlis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; focuses the power of Q-State’s powerful, 100% optical electrophysiology platform on novel, stem cell-derived, disease-in-dish models of ALS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It’s a Dead Sea microorganism that is the basis of the enabling Q-State technology. QuasAr proteins, derived from this microbe, respond to action potentials and synaptic signals by emitting near-infrared fluorescence. These Optopatch assays thus deliver higher throughput and information content than traditional patch clamp assays, and they also provide better resolution and lower phototoxicity than other optical screening tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Known around the world as a leader in cardiovascular science and biomedical engineering, Dr. Igor Efimov and his team developed a method for optically mapping organotypic cultures of donor human heart slices, enabling users to test the cardiac safety and efficacy of therapeutic candidates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The culture method preserves heart tissue architecture and extracellular matrix — aspects of heart health that cannot be revealed by iPSC-derived cardiac cells or other traditional assays for cardiovascular toxicology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/efimov-lab-department-of-biomedical-engineering&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Visit the lab’s storefront &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;for a list of their recent exciting publications — this is clearly a team to watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Automation is a rapidly advancing area of biotechnology, and Science Exchange hopes to give our researchers access to unique robotics platforms while helping them save on equipment costs and manage laboratory space limitations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic’s robotic cloud lab paradigm means biologists can be running experiments on the other side of the planet from their lab, leveraging a bank of robotic workcells for massive experimentation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; frees researchers to focus on the creative aspects of their science by providing faster, more reliable and repeatable processes with vastly lower capital costs than previously possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differentiators: Transparency, flexibility, multiplex-ity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1134&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Transcriptic-Robotic-Workcell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Transcriptic Robotic Workcell&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1134&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Transcriptic-Robotic-Workcell-300x192.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Multiple integrated automated devices per workcell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No other service provider on the planet can tell you exactly how they run an experiment on the user’s behalf. Transcriptic provides deep transparency into how users’ experiments were run by executing experiments exactly as specified and also providing retrospective diagnostic data on individual instrument performance during the experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible robotics: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Being a robotic cloud lab, the Transcriptic system can dynamically provision robotic resources to process samples for users. For example, the system might start the week at a scale of one plate and end the week on hundreds of plates. Users only pay for the resources they use, reaping the reproducibility and throughput benefits of robotics without any of the overhead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy multiplexing: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Transcriptic web application makes it easy as checking a box to detect an additional analyte in your sample. When it’s that easy, you can perform multiplexed quantiation of more analytes, starting to generate a more accurate picture of the phenotypic state of your sample.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Featured Service: Mesocale Discovery (MSD) Assay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MSD assay, validated in many bioanalytical methods per U.S. FDA and EMA guidances, is offered as a service by Transcriptic. The Mesoscale Discovery Sector S 600 instrument is fully integrated with the Transcriptic robotic cloud lab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MSD S 600 instrument performs multiplexed detection of up to 10 analytes per well, ensuring the highest data-to-sample quantity efficiency, in immunoassays. Multiple assay panels are available from the V-Plex line, all conducted with complete automated precision by robots in the cloud. Custom panel assays are also available through the MSD U-Plex system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why requesters choose Transcriptic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic, in collaboration with multiple biopharma companies and non-academic laboratories, has delivered many peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic presented one interesting study at SynBioBeta 2016. In collaboration with EpiBiome, Transcriptic’s automated platform provided a robust, reproducible and high-throughput method for on-demand microbiome characterization. This workflow captured sample prep through NGS and sequencing analysis in 7-10 days, allowing for fast, iterative cycles of microbiome screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: Breaking memory circuits with marijuana</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/GhJUqw4RZoM/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PotBrain-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranoia. Munchies. Giggles. Sleepiness. Memory loss. Although the effects of cannabinoids–the active components of marijuana–are familiar to many, their neurobiological substrates are poorly characterized. Perhaps the effect of greatest interest to both neuroscientists and to cannabis users hoping to preserve their cognitive function, is short-term memory impairment that often accompanies marijuana use. Our partial understanding of its physiological and behavioral effects is not for want of studies into its neural effects. Ample research has shown a range of changes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481526/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurotransmission, receptors, ion channels and mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; following cannabinoid exposure. However, knowledge of its cellular and molecular properties alone cannot offer a complete picture of its system-wide effects leading to cognitive and behavioral changes. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005624&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; took a novel approach to address this issue, combining computational modeling with electrophysiological brain recordings from rats performing a memory task, to unravel the dynamics of neural circuits under the influence of cannabinoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis impairs memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess memory changes induced by cannabinoids, the scientists injected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, into rats before they performed a “delayed-nonmatch-to-sample” working memory task. In this task, rats are cued with one of two levers, and after a delay, are required to select the opposite lever. Compared to sober sessions, performance under THC was impaired by 12%, confirming the all-too-familiar memory impairment associated with cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC alters hippocampal activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-19447&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified-300x163.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The researchers focused on the hippocampus, a brain region essential for forming new memories, to examine how THC alters neural function underlying these memory deficits. The hippocampus has a characteristic circuit through three main subregions, whereby signal projects from the dentate gyrus to CA3 (via mossy fibers), and from CA3 to CA1 (via Schaffer collaterals). Although THC did not alter the mean firing rate in either CA3 or CA1, the researchers discovered more nuanced drug effects within hippocampal subregions. Neurons in the hippocampus are known to demonstrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18284371&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selectivity for particular stimuli&lt;/a&gt;, and in this task, some neurons responded preferentially to lever presentations. After THC administration, this selectivity to lever presentation was reduced, suggesting that THC lowers information coding by the hippocampus. Further, theta power in CA1 was also reduced after THC administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC breaks the memory circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these preliminary results validate prior findings that cannabinoids disrupt traditional properties of neural activity, they do not speak to how THC modifies network-level signaling subserving memory. To probe functional circuitry, the researchers modeled intracellular and extracellular processes–such as refractory periods, potassium conductance or recurrent connections–contributing to CA3 to CA1 signaling. Memory deficits from THC correlated with both reduced feedforward excitation, and increased feedback excitation, along the CA3 to CA1 pathway. Modeling dynamic filters of this circuit, they further discovered that THC-induced memory impairments correlated with less feedforward theta and greater feedback theta-blocking from CA1. THC also reduced the number of CA3-CA1 connections, together suggesting that THC functionally isolates neurons from the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 subregions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed a clear disruption by THC in the hippocampal circuitry supporting memory, though it didn’t directly examine what &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; this functional breakdown. The brain possesses its own endocannabinoid system, which includes several cannabinoid receptors and endogenous endocannabinoids, which act on these receptors. In the drug-free brain, this system is involved in regulating functions such as mood, sleep, appetite, and of course, memory. Follow-up research will be necessary to clarify exactly how exogenous cannabinoids like THC wreak havoc on this system, but the authors speculate that THC may reduce feedforward excitation by activating CA3 CB1 receptors and reducing glutamate release, and increase feedback excitation by reducing CA1 interneuron output. Importantly, the authors emphasize, effects of cannabinoids on neural function aren’t one-size-fits-all. It’s likely that the brain’s excitation/inhibition balance depends on THC dose, leading to unique functional and behavioral changes under distinct drug conditions. Such differences in neural signaling dynamics, determined by drug dose and the targeted brain circuitry, could explain inconsistent reports of cannabinoids on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22019959&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pro- and anti-convulsant activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study helps to fill a critical gap in our understanding, between the microscopic cellular and macroscopic whole-brain levels, of the ways in which cannabis impairs memory. The authors stress that “&lt;em&gt;in order to truly understand the effects of THC, one must study the systems level changes in circuit dynamics rather than taking a reductionist approach and studying the effects of THC on any particular receptor or cell type&lt;/em&gt;.” By adopting the novel approach of modeling causal network dynamics, their research points to the breakdown of information flow along the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway as a major route of THC-induced memory disruption. As the researchers explain, their work “&lt;em&gt;is the first which examines the effect of THC on neuronal systems dynamics, or the causal interactions between signals, rather than on neuronal signals themselves&lt;/em&gt;.” More research examining causal brain circuitry will eventually lead to a more complete understanding of the diverse ways in which cannabinoids alter behavior and cognitive function, from causing memory loss and sleepiness to giggles and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Why is Forgetting Good for Your Brain and Health?</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/20/why-forgetting-is-important-for-the-brain-functions/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The idea that forgetting is important for the proper functioning of the brain and memory may sound counterintuitive. However, forgetting is part of the process of memorizing, and it does not make us any less smart. Research shows that our brain has active mechanisms for forgetting. Both storing and losing memories are important for selecting and holding the most relevant information. Forgetting helps to get rid of outdated information. Forgetting the details also helps to generalize past experiences into specific categories and thus create appropriate responses to similar situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/20/deliberately-forgetting-memories-easy-for-some/&quot;&gt;Forgetting&lt;/a&gt; details helps us to remember what needs to be remembered. You cannot craft a good text without deleting and proofreading its parts. As the saying goes, it is the empty space between the notes that makes the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about forgetting in this article, we are not discussing forgetting related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/14/prevention-is-the-best-medicine-for-dementia/&quot;&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or any other neurodegenerative disease. We are talking about forgetting processes that take place in a healthy individual and are essential for the healthy working of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis, our brain is bombarded with too much information. Most of this information is more like noise that interferes with our &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/01/the-neurology-of-anxiety-in-times-of-critical-decision-making/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; and reduces the clarity of thoughts. Something needs to be done with this unneeded information. Forgetting improves the flexibility of the brain by removing such outdated and unnecessary information. It also helps to streamline our memory by eliminating useless details and generalizing the concepts involved. The function of memory is not to simply pass information through time, but also to optimize future decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgetting has a special function in the memorizing process. Remembering things has a cost for&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/16/how-to-deal-with-destination-memory-issues-did-i-already-tell-you/&quot;&gt; memory&lt;/a&gt;, thus forgetting irrelevant things is a cost-saving process. Our memory change is bi-directional. Some memories are made stronger, while others are either repressed or completely deleted. This makes the process of retrieving important information more efficient, as the brain uses fewer resources. Although forgetting may be frustrating, it has some fundamental benefits that aid our ability to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgetting is also essential for our mental health. If this sound like an exaggeration, think about depression and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/24/how-does-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-change-the-brain/&quot;&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder &lt;/a&gt;(PTSD). Forgetting is essential for post-traumatic recovery. People with difficulties forgetting things are more prone to depression and psychological trauma. This is the reason why one of the key components of treating PTSD is memory repression or forgetting. Thus, the ability to forget can be used as a protective mechanism that helps to improve mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers even believe that forgetting is related to ethics. If unjust thoughts continue to linger in your mind, they may finally result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/05/04/are-humans-hard-wired-to-torture/&quot;&gt;unethical actions&lt;/a&gt;. Forgetting helps us to get rid of the wrong kind of thoughts and actions. Forgetting is important for leaving behind previously experienced humiliations and continuing on with pride. Forgetting helps us to move towards the future, leaving the past behind. Both memory and forgetting contribute to the continuation of life, allowing us to forget the anger and pains of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgetting helps us to construct our life’s plot as we want. Without forgetting unnecessary things, we cannot create a design of our liking. We cannot tell a beautiful story without omitting some secondary details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proper balance in life, both conservation of memory and forgetting are important. Yoni Van Den Eede aptly wrote that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this doubled Faustian bargain, we must ask ourselves towards which of the two sides we have been biased, and how we can reach a balance that combines enforcement with—consciously sought-after—limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believed the copious alarmist commentary in the newspapers, you’d fear for the future of our species. Today’s children, we’re told, are more hyperactive and technology addicted than ever before. They’ve lost any ability to sit still, instead craving constant stimulation from digital devices and exhausted parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might this mean for their performance on the most famous psychological measure of childhood self-control, Walter Mischel’s Marshmallow Test? Surely, kids of today will struggle far more than previous generations to resist the lure of one marshmallow (or other treat) now for the promise of two in ten minutes or so, as the task requires? In a new survey, the majority of child development experts certainly believed so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet based on his analysis of 50 years worth of performance data on the Marshmallow Test – &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/jghdm/&quot;&gt;released as a preprint at the Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt; – John Protzko at the University of California, Santa Barbara, concludes that in fact children of today are capable of more self-restraint than previous generations, with their ability to delay gratification having increased by about a minute per decade over the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30244&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko combined the results from every published and unpublished use of the Marshmallow Test that he could find, starting with Mischel’s seminal work first published in 1968 and including 4 studies in the 1970s, 3 in the 1990s, 6 in the 2000s, and 16 in our current decade, all involving children aged ten or younger. Protzko speculates that the gap in the 1980s is due to the introduction at that time of a rival test of self-regulation which is quicker to administer – the so-called gift-delay task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before crunching the numbers, Protzko polled 260 members of the Cognitive Development Society Listserv about how they thought the results would come out. Just over 50 per cent predicted that Protzko would find children’s powers of self-restraint would be lower today than the in past; 20 per cent predicted no change over time; and just 16 per cent believed that children today would outperform the children of the past (the others said there wouldn’t be enough data to answer the question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko found a statistically significant linear trend – children’s ability to resist immediate temptation and wait for a greater reward seems to have increased over the decades (this remained true when removing two study outliers, marked as black circles in the graph above). The increase in delay of gratification ability is similar in size to the known increase in average IQ seen over the same timescale, possibly reflecting shared mechanisms, though this is speculation at this stage. Meanwhile, variation in Marshmallow Test performance has stayed the same over the decades, which means that average improvement has been seen across the spread of ability, not just among those children who are more self-restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could the experts have got it so wrong? Protzko’s suggests they are prone to same bias as the rest of us, what he calls the “kids these days” phenomenon: “people’s memories for their own and others’ abilities in childhood are unduly influenced by their current abilities. While it is easy to look at kids these days and deride their inability to control themselves and decry the downfall of civilisation, it is much harder to accurately recall our own selves as children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the apparent improvement in children’s powers of self-control bode well for the future, for instance in terms of reduced criminality and addiction? Protzko thinks not, speculating that it is probably one’s ability relative to others, rather than one’s absolute ability, that is relevant to future behaviour – the lowest performers will remain at risk, he suggests. “These [unhealthy and dangerous] behaviours have been with humans for thousands of years, and will be with us for thousands more,” he predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes and consequences of the apparent increase in children’s powers of self-restraint over time remain to be uncovered by future research. For now, Protzko says the data show that “Contrary to historical and present complaints, kids these days appear to be better than we were. A supposed modern culture of instant gratification has not stemmed the march of improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;

High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further improve fidelity are unknown5–9. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state10 when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we designed a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more tree species diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia combined. Biologists have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity. Latitudinal variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in ecological and evolutionary processes, and evidence increasingly shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and clade dispersal. However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.

             Despite their fundamental biological and clinical importance, the molecular
                mechanisms that regulate the first cell fate decisions in the human embryo are not
                well understood. Here we use CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing to
                investigate the function of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 during human
                embryogenesis. We identified an efficient OCT4-targeting guide RNA using an
                inducible human embryonic stem cell-based system and microinjection of mouse
                zygotes. Using these refined methods, we efficiently and specifically targeted the
                gene encoding OCT4 (POU5F1) in diploid human zygotes and found that
                blastocyst development was compromised. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that, in
                    POU5F1-null cells, gene expression was downregulated not only for
                extra-embryonic trophectoderm genes, such as CDX2, but also for regulators of
                the pluripotent epiblast, including NANOG. By contrast, Pou5f1-null
                mouse embryos maintained the expression of orthologous genes, and blastocyst
                development was established, but maintenance was compromised. We conclude that
                CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing is a powerful method for investigating
                gene function in the context of human development.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Regulation of DNA repair pathway choice in S and G2 phases by the NHEJ inhibitor CYREN</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/yrj4PHTGegg/nature24023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and homologous recombination compete for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks during the cell cycle. Homologous recombination is inhibited during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both pathways are active in the S and G2 phases. However, it is unclear why cNHEJ does not always outcompete homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases. Here we show that CYREN (cell cycle regulator of NHEJ) is a cell-cycle-specific inhibitor of cNHEJ. Suppression of CYREN allows cNHEJ to occur at telomeres and intrachromosomal breaks during the S and G2 phases, and cells lacking CYREN accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside the G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose that CYREN is a direct cell-cycle-dependent inhibitor of cNHEJ that promotes error-free repair by homologous recombination during cell cycle phases when sister chromatids are present.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             The characterization of mutational processes that generate sequence diversity in the
                human genome is of paramount importance both to medical genetics
                and to evolutionary studies. To understand how the age and sex of
                transmitting parents affect de novo mutations, here we sequence 1,548
                Icelanders, their parents, and, for a subset of 225, at least one child, to
                35× genome-wide coverage. We find 108,778 de novo mutations, both
                single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels, and determine the parent of origin of
                42,961. The number of de novo mutations from mothers increases by 0.37 per
                year of age (95% CI 0.32–0.43), a quarter of the 1.51 per year from fathers
                (95% CI 1.45–1.57). The number of clustered mutations increases faster with
                the mother’s age than with the father’s, and the genomic span of
                maternal de novo mutation clusters is greater than that of paternal ones. The
                types of de novo mutation from mothers change substantially with age, with a
                0.26% (95% CI 0.19–0.33%) decrease in
                cytosine–phosphate–guanine to
                thymine–phosphate–guanine (CpG&amp;gt;TpG) de novo mutations and
                a 0.33% (95% CI 0.28–0.38%) increase in C&amp;gt;G de novo mutations per
                year, respectively. Remarkably, these age-related changes are not distributed
                uniformly across the genome. A striking example is a 20 megabase region on
                chromosome 8p, with a maternal C&amp;gt;G mutation rate that is up to 50-fold greater
                than the rest of the genome. The age-related accumulation of maternal non-crossover
                gene conversions also mostly occurs within these regions. Increased sequence
                diversity and linkage disequilibrium of C&amp;gt;G variants within regions affected by
                excess maternal mutations indicate that the underlying mutational process has
                persisted in humans for thousands of years. Moreover, the regional excess of C&amp;gt;G
                variation in humans is largely shared by chimpanzees, less by gorillas, and is
                almost absent from orangutans. This demonstrates that sequence diversity in humans
                results from evolving interactions between age, sex, mutation type, and genomic
                location.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: ApoE4 markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/cQa8z9TYme0/nature24016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other ApoE isoforms. However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on either a human ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we show that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by three months of age compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age, P301S mice with different ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia results in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with the lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage and death compared with the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive for amyloid-β pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease who usually have tau pathology, ε4-carriers demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts a ‘toxic’ gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is protective.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Glycosylation, the covalent attachment of carbohydrate structures onto proteins, is the most abundant post-translational modification. Over 50% of human proteins are glycosylated, which alters their activities in diverse fundamental biological processes. Despite the importance of glycosylation in biology, the identification and functional validation of complex glycoproteins has remained largely unexplored. Here we develop a novel quantitative approach to identify intact glycopeptides from comparative proteomic data sets, allowing us not only to infer complex glycan structures but also to directly map them to sites within the associated proteins at the proteome scale. We apply this method to human and mouse embryonic stem cells to illuminate the stem cell glycoproteome. This analysis nearly doubles the number of experimentally confirmed glycoproteins, identifies previously unknown glycosylation sites and multiple glycosylated stemness factors, and uncovers evolutionarily conserved as well as species-specific glycoproteins in embryonic stem cells. The specificity of our method is confirmed using sister stem cells carrying repairable mutations in enzymes required for fucosylation, Fut9 and Slc35c1. Ablation of fucosylation confers resistance to the bioweapon ricin, and we discover proteins that carry a fucosylation-dependent sugar code for ricin toxicity. Mutations disrupting a subset of these proteins render cells ricin resistant, revealing new players that orchestrate ricin toxicity. Our comparative glycoproteomics platform, SugarQb, enables genome-wide insights into protein glycosylation and glycan modifications in complex biological systems.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Targeting neuronal activity-regulated neuroligin-3 dependency in high-grade glioma</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/YeG_6CjYoT4/nature24014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, and represent the leading cause of brain tumour-related death in both children and adults. Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K–mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K–mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.

             Research on neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex has focused on the existence
                and strength of synapses between neurons, and their location on the cell bodies and
                dendrites of postsynaptic neurons. The synaptic architecture of individual
                presynaptic axonal trees, however, remains largely unknown. Here we used dense
                reconstructions from three-dimensional electron microscopy in rats to study the
                synaptic organization of local presynaptic axons in layer 2 of the medial entorhinal
                cortex, the site of grid-like spatial representations. We observe
                path-length-dependent axonal synapse sorting, such that axons of excitatory neurons
                sequentially target inhibitory neurons followed by excitatory neurons. Connectivity
                analysis revealed a cellular feedforward inhibition circuit involving wide,
                myelinated inhibitory axons and dendritic synapse clustering. Simulations show that
                this high-precision circuit can control the propagation of synchronized activity in
                the medial entorhinal cortex, which is known for temporally precise discharges.

             In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon
                specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer
                    types. However, the underlying mechanisms that direct
                this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its
                systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility. Here,
                we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the
                early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire
                highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG
                density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The
                extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of

                extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based
                suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which
                coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made
                deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used—and frequently
                oncogenic—signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic
                cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may
                therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous
                reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Strains, functions and dynamics in the expanded Human Microbiome Project</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             The characterization of baseline microbial and functional diversity in the human
                microbiome has enabled studies of microbiome-related disease, diversity,
                biogeography, and molecular function. The National Institutes of Health Human
                Microbiome Project has provided one of the broadest such characterizations so far.
                Here we introduce a second wave of data from the study, comprising 1,631 new
                metagenomes (2,355 total) targeting diverse body sites with multiple time points in
                265 individuals. We applied updated profiling and assembly methods to provide new
                characterizations of microbiome personalization. Strain identification revealed
                subspecies clades specific to body sites; it also quantified species with
                phylogenetic diversity under-represented in isolate genomes. Body-wide functional
                profiling classified pathways into universal, human-enriched, and body site-enriched
                subsets. Finally, temporal analysis decomposed microbial variation into rapidly
                variable, moderately variable, and stable subsets. This study furthers our knowledge
                of baseline human microbial diversity and enables an understanding of personalized
                microbiome function and dynamics.

But for others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Coming to terms with the neural basis of who we are can be very  unnerving. It has been called &lt;b&gt;“neuroexistentialism”&lt;/b&gt;, which really  captures the essence of it.

In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroexistentialism: Third-Wave Existentialism&quot;&gt;introductory chapter&lt;/a&gt;, Flanagan and Caruso define this philosophical variant in the progression of existentialisms to the present third-wave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“There are three kinds of existentialism that respond to three different kinds of grounding projects—grounding in God’s nature, in a shared vision of the collective good, or in science. The first-wave existentialism of Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche expressed anxiety about the idea that meaning and morals are made secure because of God’s omniscience and good will. The second-wave existentialism of Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, was a post-holocaust response to the idea that some uplifting secular vision of the common good might serve as a foundation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today, there is a third-wave existentialism, neuroexistentialism, which expresses the anxiety that even as science yields the truth about human nature it also disenchants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The theory of evolution together with advances in neuroscience remove the last vestiges of an immaterial soul or self that can know the nature of what is really true, good, and beautiful.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don't understand why the neuroscientific view must be so disenchanting. (But then again I'm a neuroscientist.) I knew fellow students who went to church yet easily reconciled their cell culture day jobs with their religious beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patriciachurchland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Patricia Churchland&lt;/a&gt; is the best at explaining the “Don't Worry, Be Happy” response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029450-200-the-benefits-of-realising-youre-just-a-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuroexistential terror&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q - Some might say the idea that you are just your brain makes life  bleak, unforgiving and ultimately futile. How do you respond to that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A - It’s  not at all bleak. I don’t see how the existence of a god or a soul  confers any meaning on my life. How does that work, exactly? Nobody has  ever given an adequate answer. My life is meaningful because I have  family, meaningful work, because I love to play, I have dogs, I love to  dig in the garden. That’s what makes my life meaningful, and I think  that’s true for most people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s1600/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;358&quot; data-original-width=&quot;792&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s400/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Word cloud for the 18 chapter titles in &lt;i&gt;Neuroexistentialism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scope of Neuroexistentialsim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, it's about free will, morality, meaning, and purpose. And of course neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my puzzlement about who suffers from a modern-day ailment caused by science spoilers. I found the below sentence to be both condescending and hyperbolic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;But for most ordinary folk and many members of the nonscientific academy, the idea that humans are animal and that the mind is the brain is destabilizing and disenchanting, quite possibly nauseating, a source of dread, fear and trembling, sickness unto death even.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the authors overascribe the illness and exaggerate the depth of ennui experienced by “most ordinary folk” who are too busy to grapple with the scientific implications of social neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don't mean to be overly snarky but right now I'm grappling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;, and with second-wave existential crises caused by crazed leaders with bad hair who wave around their phallic symbols of nuclear destruction, and with persisting racism that divides the country, and with the hypocrisy of anti-immigration Christians, and with a future of toxic air and coastal regions underwater.

Why not apply psychopharmacological principles (and/or psychotherapy) to calm the fearful and trembling mind? We have already presupposed that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;mind = brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (which brought us “sickness unto death even”), and that medications can alter brain function in psychiatric disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not the correct way forward (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“...Are there naturalistic resources that can quell the anxiety produced by the ascendancy of the scientific image generally, and specifically, the picture that comes from combining neo-Darwinism with neuroscience, which produces the new and nerve-wracking anxiety associated with neuroexistentialism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One promising approach is to pursue a kind of descriptive-normative inquiry into the causes and conditions of flourishing for material beings living in a material world, whose self-understanding includes the idea that such a world is the only kind of world that there is and thus that the meaning and significance of their lives, if there is any, must be found in such a world. We can call such an inquiry&lt;i&gt; eudaimonics&lt;/i&gt; (Flanagan 2007, 2009).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the solution to third-wave existentialism is positive psychology (as opposed to despair).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism#Despair&quot;&gt;Despair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the   conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is   in even when he isn't overtly in despair. So long as a person's   identity depends on qualities that can crumble, he is considered to be   in perpetual despair. And as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human   essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the   individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s1600/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;884&quot; data-original-width=&quot;614&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s400/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/existential-neuroscience-field-in.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Existential Neuroscience: a field in search of meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in 2013, the field of Existential Neuroscience (distinct from Neuroexistentialism) took the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;SCAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by storm, with neuroimaging studies focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terror management theory&lt;/a&gt; (which describes how we deal with the inevitability of death).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some brains struck by pathology seem to stave off its effects thanks to a “cognitive reserve”: a superior use of mental resources that may be related to the way we use our brains over a lifetime, for instance through high levels of education or, possibly, learning a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilingual people certainly seem to use their brains differently. For example, practice at switching languages has been associated with enhanced mental control. It’s even been claimed that being bilingual can stave off dementia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/100218-bilingual-brains-alzheimers-dementia-science-aging/&quot;&gt;up to four or five years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, this would have serious implications for public policy – learning a second language would be as much a desirable health behaviour as it is an educational or cultural one. But are the brain benefits of bilingualism real? The &lt;i&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/i&gt; has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170131&quot;&gt;a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; to establish the strength of the evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30079&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University College London research team, led by Naaheed Mukadam, surveyed hundreds of papers published up to November 2016, finding fourteen high-quality studies that measured dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment (a more subtle analogue and frequent precursor of dementia) as well as participants’ status as either mono-lingual or bilingual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the studies drew their conclusions from patients who had attended clinics complaining of memory problems, and their results were in favour of bilingualism. In one study, the age of diagnosis for amnesic mild cognitive impairment was around four to five years later for bilingual patients compared to monolingual. Another five studies asked when people began noticing their symptoms, and these also found the similar four to five year delay for bilinguals. Two of the eight found no significant effects, but the preponderance of evidence here looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, all of these papers were retrospective, and depended on when people decided to show up to a clinic, and/or their accurate dating of when their symptoms began. Complicating matters is the fact that bilingual people from minority ethnic backgrounds are known to seek help later for dementia, on average, probably for social and cultural reasons. Moreover, these studies rarely controlled for education, which tends to be higher for non-minority multi-linguals, and as education itself contributes to cognitive reserve, this may be another confound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better controlled studies that identify a sample of people free from dementia and then follow them in the future are easier to interpret. Mukadam’s team identified five such studies. These found that five years after recruitment there were no significant differences between bilingual and monolingual participants in terms of whether they had developed any memory problems or neurological diagnoses. A meta-analysis using the raw diagnosis numbers from each study – a total of just over 5,000 participants – confirmed that bilingualism does not stave off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a weak evidence base doesn’t mean an effect isn’t real. Indeed, more recent research from a team of Italian researchers used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/7/1690.full&quot;&gt;neuroimaging techniques&lt;/a&gt; to make a more systematic case for the benefits of bilingualism, including that it is associated with greater neural connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Italian work is too recent to feature in the new review, but it’s notable that it escapes some of the methodological problems discussed above. However, when I brought this to Naaheed Makadem (the lead author of the new review), she raised a few considerations: firstly, that the new neuroimaging study investigated people who were generally lifelong bilinguals, living in a bilingual context (the Italian-German borderlands of Italy), which affords more opportunities for lifelong mode-switching than would be found for cases of adult migration or deciding to pick up a new language; secondly, she points to other potential confounding factors, such as employment and social status (i.e. the apparent neural advantages of bilinguals might be related to their being more likely to be in employment and higher social status).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi-lingual mind may have important consequences, but it’s not clear that recommendations to learn a second language later in life will necessarily produce the protections that have been claimed. Makadem’s team conclude their work by suggesting that “public health policy should therefore remove recommendations regarding bilingualism as a strategy to delay dementia and instead concentrate on more generally reducing cognitive inactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Science Exchange Survey Reveals Pain Points of Outsourcing R&amp;D</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contract review, service provider qualification, and security of intellectual property among major concerns for biotech and pharma leaders surveyed at 2017 industry conferences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.– More than 100 biotechnology and drug development leaders who responded to surveys conducted during industry conferences earlier this year reported a wide range of barriers to the outsourcing of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) services, including the contracts review process, intellectual property (IP) security concerns, and service provider qualification. The surveys were conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51684706&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170918005083&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Science+Exchange&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=d9ebe5ccb2e80e5f010a479455ac2f70&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), during the 2017 Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) International Convention and 2017 Drug Industry Association (DIA) Global Annual Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 75 percent of Science Exchange survey respondents ranked the following concerns as barriers (a significant barrier or somewhat of a barrier) to the outsourcing of R&amp;amp;D services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Having contracts reviewed and signed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Security of IP;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Identifying service providers with required expertise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Qualifying service providers; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Negotiating pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management related to R&amp;amp;D outsourcing was also reported as having a significant impact on these R&amp;amp;D leaders, with over 40 percent of those responding to the survey indicating they spent more than 20 hours to onboard each new outsourcing partner, from the request for proposal process, through contracting and start of the project. Finally, further demonstrating the impact of the time spent on administrative tasks related to outsourcing, more than 75 percent of survey respondents reported that the “hassle” of bringing on a new partner has previously led them to choose an existing vendor rather than seek out a more qualified option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The results of this survey echo the same concerns we heard from the leading biotech and pharma companies who now rely on Science Exchange to help them efficiently manage their outsourced R&amp;amp;D services,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “In review of enterprise clients’ experiences, we find that our Science Exchange clients save thousands of work hours each year on procurement, business operations, contracting and legal resources, and administrative tasks related to outsourcing — time that can instead be spent in discovery. It’s gratifying to see that we’re able to fulfill our goal to support the scientific discovery process by removing barriers to innovation for our clients.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: When neurogenesis goes wrong…</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/VUT_ywAeuoY/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PLOSOne-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is a complex biological process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Indeed, the discovery of a dynamic neurogenesis in the adult brain (in both humans and animals) was a kind of extraordinary revelation. In fact, contrary to common popular belief, neurogenesis continuously occurs in specific regions in the adult brain, such as in the hippocampus and the striatum. Neurogenesis occurs in both physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
In the hippocampus, newly born granule cells (GC) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) migrate in the granule cell layer and become functionally integrated into neuronal networks within four to six weeks. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that newborn neurons generated in the context of cerebral ischemia may fail to correctly integrate into pre-existing networks. However, the cellular mechanisms of how ischemic infarcts cause alteration of hippocampal functions are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory, neurogenesis and morphological alterations following cerebral stroke &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183463&quot;&gt;PLOS One article&lt;/a&gt;, Woitke and collegues (Jena University Hospital, Germany) hypothesized that increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following stroke may be associated with aberrant neurogenic activity and impaired hippocampus-dependent functions. This might sound somehow counterintuitive, since one would expect that increased neurogenesis may lead to improved cognitive functions. But this is not the case, or at least it does not represent the full and exact picture of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is well known that cerebral stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, although the functional role of this post-lesion response is mostly unclear. In a physiological context, neurogenesis is strictly regulated and less than 1% of new neurons have aberrant connections in the intact brain. Things may be different following brain damage and insults (strokes, seizures, etc). Using behavioral and viral approaches “&lt;em&gt;we now prove,&lt;/em&gt;” says Woitke, the leading author of the study, “&lt;em&gt;that aberrant neurogenesis also occurs in the murine hippocampus and is associated with poorer performance in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks following focal infarcts.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a first attempt, Woitke and colleagues performed the Morris Water Maze (MWM), a hippocampus-dependent behavioral task routinely used to assess spatial memory functions. Parameters such as latencies (“time to find the platform”) and distance (“path lengths”) to navigate to the platform were analyzed. As expected, brain ischemic mice generally needed more time to locate the platform, thus suggesting impaired learning and memory functions. In addition, analysis of the adaptive learning strategies in both groups revealed that animals with stroke used a less efficient navigation strategy to find the platform, while hippocampal-dependent strategies were employed more frequently by the control group. When looking at neurogenesis processes the authors observed an increased number of new born neurons in the hippocampus of mice with stroke. Thus, in a second set of experiments, the authors addressed the question of whether the newly generated neurons may have aberrant morphology and location, which in turn may be related to malfunction of hippocampal networks and circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Using retroviral labeling, we detected a significant number of new GC with atypical morphology and dendritic branching following ischemia,&lt;/em&gt;” says Silke Keiner, the senior author of the study. In particular, GC displayed an additional dendritic tree extending from the basal pole towards the hilus (a specific subregion of the dentate gyrus) which is considered a typical immature feature of GC neurons. Taken together, ischemia increases the number of newborn neurons but promotes aberrant dendritic branching indicating maladaptive plasticity in the DG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that integrated and functional neurons require dendritic spines. Interestingly, the expression of mature mushroom spines by aberrant newborn cells strongly suggests that these neurons are synaptically integrated, thus being able to influence and alter hippocampal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this study reveals that even a low number of aberrant neurons may severely affect hippocampal functions such as learning and memory. However, the casual link among cellular modifications, neurogenesis and impaired memory functions is far from being fully elucidated. In fact, the analysis of the functional impact of adult neurogenesis in behavioral experiments or cognitive tasks is still quite challenging. As mentioned by the authors, “&lt;em&gt;more studies are needed to clarify whether tailored rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches might counteract aberrant neurogenesis and improve hippocampal-dependent memory performance.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Decision-making: the Role of Neuronal Crowdsourcing</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/18/decision-making-the-role-of-neuronal-crowdsourcing/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making, in most cases, is not a straightforward process. Facing contradictory facts and opinions, people often struggle to decide on the best way forward when a complicated problem needs to be solved. In human society, we eventually rely on two methods of decision-making: we can follow the will of the majority, or we can delegate the task of decision-making to a leader thus leaving all deliberations (and responsibilities) to this single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists ask: How does this works on the level of brain cells? If your brain has to make a decision, how do your individual neurons come to a unified conclusion? Do they use the “majority mechanism”? Or maybe there are some neurons whose “opinion” dominates the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter approach is known as a “grandmother theory”. Grandmother analogy was suggested in the 1960s to propagate the idea that the final decision about a single event may be taken by one dominant neuron. However, scientists also suggested that the process might be more “democratic” and involve the contribution of multiple neurons in generating the final outcome. This process is sometimes described as neuronal “crowdsourcing”.  The most recent data points to the possibility that both processes play a role in the human &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/01/the-neurology-of-anxiety-in-times-of-critical-decision-making/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to any decision is a complex mental process involving the weighing and choosing from a number of options, with each option having various characteristics. Decision-making is not a reflex action. When we make a decision there are some expected or foreseen consequences. And it is also important to note that in making any decision, we use the information that has been accumulated in our brain prior to the time of making that decision. Finally, every decision made involves &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/17/deciphering-troubled-teens-risk-taking-behavior/&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, as there is a degree of uncertainty around making decisions, and we are aware that many of these decisions can have long-term consequences. Although we know that decision-making plays a central part in our mental development, very little is known about how it occurs at the neuronal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision-making events are far more common than we tend to think. It is not simply deciding the way to take while &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/28/the-brain-road-link-new-evidence-on-cell-phones-and-driving/&quot;&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt;, or what food to have for a lunch. Decision-making is involved even in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/01/mind-your-dishes-mundane-tasks-to-improve-mental-health/&quot;&gt;easiest of tasks&lt;/a&gt;. What seems a simple task at first may have quite a complex mechanism underlying it. Just take any simple conversation as an example. Most words used in a conversation can have multiple meanings, and decisions regarding their appropriate use have to be taken at very high speed. These can be called momentous decisions: they do not require a high level of thinking and are often based on prior experience. At the neuronal level, such decisions are often taken by small groups of neurons or can even be taken by a single dominant neuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all decisions are momentous. Some decisions require a high level of thinking and calculation, and they require taking the long-term outcome of the decision into consideration. For long-term decision-making, we voluntarily focus on various information sources, and then we decide what is and is not relevant in achieving our long-term goals. Moreover, our decisions continually change according to changes in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on macaque monkeys have shown that a large part of the brain is involved in collecting information in the initial steps of decision-making. After a certain time period, when enough information is processed, the cells reach a threshold where a decision has to be made. It is at this point, it seems, that all cells start to shift in favor of one single criterion and the decision is made. It appears that when the task is complex and there are too many choices, crowdsourcing works best. Lots of information is analyzed before all of the neurons come to a single decision, and this decision is communicated to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to say that quick decision-making cannot be done with crowdsourcing. In fact, many decisions would likely make use of more distant parts of the brain and multiple neurons. We are often faced with decisions that are complex yet have to be taken quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/27/thinking-slow-about-thinking-fast-part-iv-the-framing-effect/&quot;&gt;Quick decisions&lt;/a&gt; have their own benefits and risks. There are higher chances of error, yet, in many cases, making a decision quickly is imperative. It is quite possible that the brain has some kind of mechanism to minimize this rate of error for quick and decentralized decision-making. The process of crowdsourcing and decentralized decision-making has been studied in detail in colonies of ants, where many decisions are taken by the crowd, though it often comes at the cost of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether decision-making is prompt or delayed, a factor that seems to be of great influence is the expected reward or outcome. It is quite possible that certain areas of the brain may be dedicated to it. Thus playing the role of influencers, be it the decision of some small group of neurons or crowdsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever way the decision-making is done, what seems to be evident from animal studies is that it has two phases. The first phase is information gathering, and the second phase consists of coming to a consensus and making the final decision. To a degree that depends on the situation, this final step may be influenced by more important neurons. Unsurprising considering the complexity of the mechanisms involved, the ‘details’ of this process are cloudy at best.&lt;/p&gt;
