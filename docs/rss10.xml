(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One eyewitness to a robbery reports that the culprit was a male in his 40s with brown hair, wearing a light-coloured T-shirt. Another describes a blond man in his early 30s wearing a denim shirt. If you’re a police officer investigating the crime, whose memory do you trust?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying which of two apparently credible but conflicting eye-witness statements to trust is a big problem for law enforcement agencies (as is deciding, in the case of a witness who has no incentive to lie, which among their memories are accurate). Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xap0000175&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, reported in the&lt;i&gt; Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, provides initial evidence for a new, objectively verifiable method for doing this. This work has, as the researchers write, “potentially far-reaching significance, not the least in the legal context.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34816&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torun Lindholm at Stockholm University and her fellow researchers report two studies. For the first, they recruited 34 men, who separately watched a video of a staged abduction of a woman by two men. Afterwards, the men, who were interviewed separately, were first asked to recall all they could about the crime, then they were given 12 specific prompts – to describe the clothing of the men who waited outside the victim’s house, for instance.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interviews were recorded, and raters later identified and pooled all the “accurate” and “inaccurate” responses. Next, two more raters then coded each of these individual responses, this time looking for cues that indicated how hard the participant had to work to produce their response (so-called “effort cues”). These included pauses in speech; filler non-words (like “um” or “uh”); filler words (like “you know” or “well”); and hedges (words that reduced the force of an assertion, such as “maybe” or “I guess”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work has found that correct memories are recalled faster than incorrect memories, which led the researchers to suspect that signs of slow, more effortful recall – like the use of lots of filler words – might indicate that a memory was faulty. As expected, the analysis showed that inaccurate responses included significantly more hedges and filler non-words and words than accurate responses. This result raises the possibility that these cues could in future be used to differentiate accurate from mistaken memories in an objective way.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study on 10 men and 10 women mostly replicated these findings, but also found that, for this group, delays while reporting a memory – another effort cue – were associated with inaccuracy. (This study also found that asking a participant how confident they were in the accuracy of a particular memory provided no additionally useful information, on top of the hedge, delay and filler data.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies do have some limitations. The number of participants was small. And they were interviewed immediately after viewing the events they were asked to describe, which would rarely happen in real life eye-witness situations. Might delays in interviewing make it harder to use effort cues to predict statement accuracy? Only further research will tell.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while use of a greater use of filler words and hedges was strongly associated with inaccuracy, that doesn’t mean that participants reporting accurate memories never used them. Will the total number of effort cues observed in a witness’s testimony allow police officers easily to distinguish between accurate and faulty memories? As yet, no one knows. Still, this work does reveal some objectively verifiable markers, and that’s an important first step. As the researchers point out, “Given research showing that most people have vast difficulties in judging the quality of others’ memories, combined with the scarcity of research on genuinely reported memories, these initial findings suggest unexplored alternatives that may prove highly useful for improving accuracy judgements.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xap0000175&quot;&gt;Retrieval effort cues predict eyewitness accuracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: “Neuroscience at Scale: Synaptomics tries to make sense of the brain at a stupefying scale” by Samuel Rose</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/7kgMAlODUD8/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/ramon_y_cajal_conexiones-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s smaller than a basketball, the scale of the human brain can feel astronomical. “There are as many neurons in the human brain as there are stars (100 billion) in the Milky Way” is commonly stated in musings on the brain. And while this figure isn’t quite accurate (it’s closer to 86 billion neurons/brain), the comparison is staggering.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Neurons, though, aren’t useful without synapses – the point of contact between neurons where chemical messages are conveyed. It’s at synapses where memories are formed and skills like dribbling a basketball are honed. And it’s at the level of the synapse where the human brain scales up to numbers that dwarf our tiny galaxy – 100 trillion synapses is the crude estimate. Any effort to catalog and characterize the brain’s population of synapses probably sounds as futile as cataloging all the stars in the universe. A new field called synaptomics, however, has emerged to try and do just that: map the molecular composition and spatial distribution of every single synapse in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of synapses is so staggering, there actually isn’t a consensus on how many there are. The number &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/100-trillion-connections/&quot;&gt;100 trillion&lt;/a&gt; appears in popular articles and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43512#_edn4&quot;&gt;teaching tools&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not typically referenced in peer-reviewed journals. 100 trillion is calculated by multiplying 100 billion neurons by 1,000 connections each, which belies the diversity in neuronal shape and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19644&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19644&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1-300x211.png&quot; width=&quot;622&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons, like “E” in the figure above, may only form a dozen synapses on its simple dendritic arbor. A neuron with a dense network of dendrites, like in “B” or “F”, above, may form 10,000 to 100,000 synapses. With 86 billion neurons spread through roughly 200 unique regions&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – each region containing unique combinations of neuron types – accurate estimation becomes close to impossible. This is not to say that finding the precise number of synapses in a human brain is the most pressing question in neuroscience. But framing this question does show how difficult it is to answer even the most basic questions at this scale. In other words, if figuring out the number of synapses isn’t feasible, how does the field begin to answer more complex questions about the brain’s catalog of synapses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach most neuroscientists take is to compartmentalize. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time, according to proverb. Neuroscientists take their fork and steak knife and start sawing away at one brain region or circuit and learn the rules that govern the set of synapses there. For example, there have been over 11,500 Pubmed cataloged publications on “hippocampal plasticity” – studies that furthered our understanding of synapses in this memory-formation region. But how do the synapses in this region compare to the rest of the brain? Will it take another 2.3 million bites (11,500 x 200 brain regions) of elephant meat to figure this out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group led by Seth Grant at University of Edinburgh is attempting to define some simple principles that distinguish and group the brain’s trillions (?) of synapses, in an effort they call the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org/&quot;&gt;Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pipeline or, more simply, synaptomics. They started with the mouse brain in a recent issue of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30581-6&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The group genetically engineered mice to express two different fluorescently “tagged” proteins: PSD95 attached to a green marker and SAP102 to an orange marker. PSD95 and SAP102 are found exclusively in synapses, so under a microscope the brains of these mice are a canvas of green and orange dots, each dot a synapse. With the naked eye, Grant and colleagues could distinguish three groups of synapses: those with PSD95, those with SAP102, and those with both. But they also measured the brightness, size, and relative density of each dot throughout the brain. Including these factors, they used machine learning to characterize the ~1 billion glowing synapses in the mouse brain. Clustering algorithms categorized 37 subtypes of synapses, each subtype with its own unique signature of brightness, size and density. The way these 37 subtypes are distributed throughout the mouse brain creates the first synaptome “signature” of a brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you could argue that an attempt to catalog 1 billion of anything would find clusters. If one were to catalog a billion cracks in the surface of a highway, groupings would likely arise. Do the synapse subtypes that Grant and colleagues observed have any significance to brain function? The fact that different synapse subtypes were enriched in certain brain regions argues that they do. For example, subtype “24” was abundant in the cerebral cortex and absent in the cerebellum. This makes sense since cerebral cortex and cerebellum develop differently and perform different functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant and colleagues also show that the synaptome signature is sensitive to insults in brain development. It has long been known that neuropsychiatric diseases like autism and schizophrenia are associated with disrupted brain connectivity. The authors saw changes in the synaptome signature of mutant mice with behavioral abnormalities resembling these neuropsychiatric diseases. These data show that the synaptome is sensitive to developmental disturbances, and changes in it may be a marker for psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is more of a starting point for synaptomics than a presentation of its fruition. For one, this study builds its synaptome map with only two of the synapse’s thousands of proteins. The stated goal of the &lt;em&gt;Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping&lt;/em&gt; pipeline is to map as many of these thousands of proteins as possible and incorporate them into a global catalog. What will neuroscience gain from this this catalog? Will future neuroscientists be able to see a memory form or a disease develop by simply “perusing” the catalog? These questions aren’t possible to answer right now, but hopefully this new field will provide some general principles that transcend the astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of playing sport on men’s testosterone levels is well documented. Generally speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X89900421&quot;&gt;the winner enjoys a testosterone boost&lt;/a&gt;, while the loser experiences the opposite (though far less studied, competition unsurprisingly also affects women’s hormonal levels, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453004000757&quot;&gt;not in the same ways as men’s&lt;/a&gt;). The evolutionary-based explanation for the hormonal effects seen in men is that the winner’s testosterone rise acts to increase their aggression and the likelihood that they will seek out more contests, while the loser skulks off to lick their wounds. When it comes to vicarious effects of competition on men’s testosterone, however, the findings are more mixed. There’s some evidence that male sports fans show testosterone gains after seeing their teams win, but other studies have failed to replicate this finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9318-2&quot;&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; adds to this literature by examining the hormonal changes (testosterone and cortisol) in fathers watching their children play a football game – a situation in which you might particularly expect to see vicarious hormonal effects since it’s the men’s own kin who are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34796&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eighteen participating fathers (average age 47) were recruited in the US state of New Mexico where they were watching their kids (average age 13) play in a local football (soccer) tournament. Nine of them were watching their sons play, the others were watching their daughters. The dads provided saliva samples before and after the matches, and also answered some questions about their child and the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropologist Louis Alvarado at the University at Albany and his colleagues, including the psychologists Melissa Eaton and Melissa Thompson at the University of New Mexico, found that the fathers’ testosterone and cortisol levels increased after the experience of watching the games (by 81 per cent and 417 per cent, respectively). These changes weren’t linked to the outcomes of the games, but were to an extent explained by whether or not the fathers believed that the referee had acted unfairly towards their child’s team – if they did perceive unfairness, the fathers’ post-match cortisol and testosterone tended to be higher (fathers with higher pre-match testosterone were also more likely to perceive unfairness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said this main result of a link between hormonal changes and fairness  perception was “consistent with a functional explanation in which hormonal changes are associated with the potential for future conflict – here, in the context of responding to potential threats affecting one’s own status and that of kin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that aggression among parents watching their kids has become “an important cultural issue”, the researchers added that their results could “… have implications for the growing body of literature that attempts to curb the problem of sideline violence by identifying the proximate and individualistic factors associated with conflict potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings to come out of the study were that fathers watching their sons showed greater testosterone rises than fathers watching their daughters, as did fathers who felt sports were less important to their child (this latter result was opposite to expectations, and the researchers speculated that it was perhaps connected to the fathers’ frustration or disappointment that their child was not taking the competition seriously enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more technical finding was that gains in the fathers’ “stress hormone” cortisol tended to predict subsequent increases in their testosterone. This result provides tentative support for the so-called “positive coregulation” model of cortisol and testosterone, in which increases in cortisol supplement the effects of testosterone when males are competing, while arguing against the opposite theory that sees cortisol as down-regulating testosterone and reducing the likelihood of the individual engaging in competitive behaviour in times of stress. The researchers said the “positive coregulation” model makes more sense in evolutionary terms, with stress (and cortisol) priming high-ranking male primates to be more competitive when they are faced with the threat of status competition from more junior males.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How to give up your cake – and eat it, too</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/27/how-to-give-up-your-cake-and-eat-it-too/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re in a packed food court, searching for somewhere to sit. Just as you spot a communal table with two free spaces, one much bigger and more comfortable-looking than the other, you realise there’s a person standing beside you with a tray and they are looking for somewhere to sit, too. What do you do? Rush to take the better seat – but appear selfish? Or let them have it, so seem generous – but eat your lunch in cramped discomfort?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-39622-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; suggests that you should do neither. Instead, you should say something like, “Oh, go ahead – you choose a seat”, and the odds are that she or he will not only leave the better seat for you, but also think that &lt;i&gt;you’re &lt;/i&gt;generous.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34794&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have generally viewed this kind of scenario as either/or – you can either be worse off materially but see your reputation enhanced, or vice versa. But it doesn’t have to be this way, according the results of eight studies involving imaginary and real-world settings, by Michael Kardas, Alex Shaw and Eugene Caruso at the University of Chicago.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a group of 300 online volunteers, they first explored how often people abdicate decisions about distributing two items of unequal value (like a “premium” granola bar and a “low-quality” version) between themselves and a friend. Nearly 70 per cent said they’d choose to abdicate the decision, mostly because they wanted to be seen as generous. In a real-world version of this study, which was conducted in a local park on pairs of people who knew each other, a roughly similar proportion – about two-thirds of the participants – chose to abdicate the decision, and when they did, the other person gave away the more valuable item more often than they kept it for themselves.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further online study, of 310 people, found that when the participants were informed, in imaginary scenarios, that their friend had abdicated a sharing decision to them, they were much more likely to give away the higher-value object than to keep it, in comparison to a scenario in which they simply had to make the decision about who got what. The researchers write that this is consistent with the idea that abdication is viewed as an act of generosity, which then prompts generosity in return. (Further studies reported in the paper provide additional evidence for this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abdication effect wasn’t only observed between friends. Participants were more likely to be selfish, and keep the high-value option, when they were simply told to decide what they or a stranger would get. But when they were told that the stranger had first abdicated the decision to them, they were again much more likely to give away the high-value option than to keep it. This held in both imaginary situations and in a real world-scenario involving gift cards of different amounts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the data reported in this paper came out of imagined rather than actual scenarios, and whether all the findings would replicate in the real world isn’t yet clear. But the effect sizes in terms of the percentages of people opting to abdicate, and opting to give away the more valuable item when informed that the other person had abdicated, were similar in both types of study, the researchers point out.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In sum,” they write, “abdication seems to be beneficial in more ways than one: abdicators are not only perceived to be generous, but they also tend to receive the larger slice of the pie.” Or, as they also put it, “abdication provides a unique opportunity for people to give up their cake and eat it too.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXIV) Is the brain a computer (2)</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I argued that the way the brain works is not algorithmic, and therefore it is not a computer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer&quot;&gt;the common sense of the term&lt;/a&gt;. This contradicts a popular view in computational neuroscience that the brain is a kind of a computer that implements algorithms. That view comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network&quot;&gt;formal neural network theory&lt;/a&gt;, and the argumentation goes as follows. Formal neural networks can implement any computable function, which is a function that can be implemented by an algorithm. Thus the brain can implement algorithms for computable functions, and therefore is by definition a computer. There are multiple errors in this reasoning. The most salient error is a semantic drift on the concept of algorithm, the second major error is a confusion on what a computer is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Algorithms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computable function is a function that can be implemented by an algorithm. But the converse “if a function is computable, then whatever implements this function runs an algorithm” is not true. To see this, we need to be a bit more specific about what is meant by “algorithm” and “computable function”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosely speaking, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm&quot;&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; is simply a set of explicit instructions to solve a problem. A cooking recipe is an algorithm in this sense. For example, to cook pasta: put water in a pan; heat up; when water boils, put pasta; wait for 10 minutes. The execution of this algorithm occurs in continuous time in a real environment. But what is algorithmic about this description is the discrete sequential flow of instructions. Water boiling itself is not algorithmic, the high-level instructions are: “when condition A is true (water boils), then do B (put pasta)”. Thus, when we speak of algorithms, we must define what is considered as elementary instructions, that is, what is beneath the algorithmic level (water boils, put pasta).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textbook definition of algorithm in computer science is: &quot;a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.&quot; (Cormen et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition&quot;&gt;Introduction to algorithms&lt;/a&gt;; possibly the most used textbook on the subject). Computability is a way to formalize the notion of algorithm for functions of integers (in particular logical functions). To formalize it, one needs to specify what is considered an elementary instruction. Thus, computability does not formalize the loose notion of algorithm above, i.e, any recipe to calculate something, for otherwise any function would be computable and the concept would be empty (to calculate f(x), apply f to x). A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function&quot;&gt;computable function&lt;/a&gt; is a function that can be calculated by a Turing machine, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-recursive_function&quot;&gt;equivalently&lt;/a&gt;, which can be generated by a small set of elementary functions on integers (with composition and recursion). Thus, an algorithm in the sense of computability theory is a discrete-time sequence of arithmetic and logical operations (and recursion). Note that this readily extend to any countable alphabet instead of integers, and of course you can replace arithmetic and logical operations with higher-order instructions, as long as they are themselves computable (ie a high-level programming language). But it is not &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of specification of how to solve a problem. For example, there are various algorithms to calculate pi. But we could also calculate pi by drawing a circle, measuring both the diameter and the perimeter, then dividing perimeter by diameter. This is not an algorithm in the sense of computability theory. It could be called an algorithm in the broader sense, but again note that what is algorithmic about it is the discrete structure of the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a device could calculate a computable function using an algorithm in the strict sense of computability, or in the broader sense (cooking recipe), or in a non-algorithmic way (i.e., without any discrete structure of instructions). In any case, what the brain or any device manages to do bears no relation with how it does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out above, what is algorithmic about a description of how something works is the discrete structure (first do A; if B is true, then do C, etc). If we removed this condition, then we would be left with the more general concept of model, not algorithm: a description of how something works. Thus, if we want to say anything specific by claiming that the brain implements algorithms, then we must insist on the discrete-time structure (steps). Otherwise, we are just saying that the brain has a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have more precisely defined what an algorithm is, let us examine whether the brain might implement algorithms. Clearly, it does not literally implement algorithms in the narrow sense of computability theory, i.e., with elementary operations on integers and recursion. But could it be that it implements algorithms in the broader sense? To get some perspective, consider the following two physical systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1538&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; src=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig10-300x122.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A) are dominoes, (B) is a tent (illustration taken from my essay “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?&lt;/a&gt;”). Both are physical systems that interact with an environment, in particular which can be perturbed by mechanical stimuli. The response of dominoes to mechanical stimuli might be likened to an algorithm, but that of the tent cannot. The fact that we can describe unambiguously (with physics) how the tent reacts to mechanical stimuli does not make the dynamics of the tent algorithmic, and the same is true of the brain. Formal neural networks (e.g. perceptrons or deep learning networks) are algorithmic, but the brain is a priori more like the tent: a set of coupled neurons that interact in continuous time, together and with the environment, with no evident discrete structure similar to an algorithm. As argued above, a specification of how these real neural networks work and solve problems is not an algorithm: it’s a model – unless we manage to map the brain’s dynamics to the discrete flow of an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Computers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if a computer is something that solves problems by running algorithms, then the brain is not a computer. We may however consider a broader definition: the computer is something that computes, i.e., which is able to calculate computable functions. As pointed out above, this does not require the computer to run algorithms. For example, consider a box with some gas, a heater (input = temperature T) and a pressure sensor (output = P). The device computes the function P = nRT/V by virtue of physical laws, and not by an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This box, however, is not a computer. Otherwise, any physical system would be called a computer. To be called a computer, the device should be able to implement any computable function. But what does it mean exactly? To run an arbitrary computable function, some parameters of the device need to be appropriately adjusted. Who adjusts these parameters and how? If we do not specify how this adjustment is being made, then the claim that the brain is a computer is essentially empty. It just says that for each function, there is a way to arrange the structure of the brain so that this function is achieved. It is essentially equivalent to the claim that atoms can calculate any computable function, depending on how we arrange them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call such a device a computer, we must additionally include a mechanism to adjust the parameters so that it does actually perform a particular computable function. This leads us to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer&quot;&gt;conventional definition of a computer&lt;/a&gt;: something that can be &lt;em&gt;instructed&lt;/em&gt; via &lt;em&gt;computer programming&lt;/em&gt;. The notion of program is central to the definition of computers, whatever form this program takes. A crucial implication is that a computer is a device that is dependent on an external operator for its function. The external operator brings the software to the computer; without the ability to receive software, the device is not a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, the brain cannot be a computer. We may then consider the following metaphorical extension: the brain is a self-programmed computer. But the circularity in this assertion is problematic. If the program is a result of the program itself, then the “computer” cannot actually implement &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; computable function, but only those that result from its autonomous functioning. A cat, a mouse, an ant and a human do not actually do the same things, and cannot even in principle do the same tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, is computability theory the right framework to describe the activity of the brain in the first place? It is certainly not the right framework to describe the interaction of a tent with its environment, so why would it be appropriate for the brain, an embodied dynamical system in circular relation with the environment? Computability theory is a theory about functions. But a dynamical system is not a function. You can of course define functions on dynamical systems, even though they do not fully characterize the system. For example, you can define the function that maps the current state to the state at some future time. In the case of the brain, we might want to define a function that maps an external perturbation of the system (i.e. a stimulus) to the state of the system at some future time. However, this is not well defined, because it depends on the state of the system at the time of the perturbation. This problem does not occur with formal neural networks precisely because these are not dynamical systems but mappings. The brain is spontaneously active, whether there is a “stimulus” or not. The very notion of the organism as something that responds to stimuli is the most naïve version of behaviorism. The organism has an endogenous activity and a circular relation to its environment. Consider for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator&quot;&gt;central pattern generators&lt;/a&gt;: these are rhythmic patterns produced in the absence of any input. Not all dynamical systems can be framed into computability theory, and in fact most of them, including the brain, cannot because they are not mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have argued in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;my essay on neural coding&lt;/a&gt;, there are two core problems with the computer metaphor of the brain (it should be clear by now that this is a metaphor and not a property). One is that it tries to match two causal structures that are totally incongruent, just like dominoes and a tent. The other is that the computer metaphor, just as the coding metaphor, implicitly assumes an external operator – who programs it / interprets the code. Thus, what these two metaphors fundamentally miss is the epistemic autonomy of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;have already established that minority groups are particularly likely to endorse conspiracy theories that involve them. For instance, the idea that AIDS was concocted in a lab to plague black people or that birth control is black genocide have been shown to have particular traction within African-American communities. It’s thought this is because members of disadvantaged groups find comfort in explanatory frameworks that appear to account for the various factors that beleaguer them. But new research from VU Amsterdam and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3442&quot;&gt;published in &lt;i&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that belonging to a minority identity, in this case being Muslim in the Netherlands or a member of an ethnic minority in that country, doesn’t merely lead to a belief in conspiracy theories related to that specific minority identity, but stokes an appetite for conspiracies in general.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34817&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan-Willem van Prooijen and his colleagues explain that there seem to be two reasons why minorities are drawn to conspiracies. First is the unpleasant feeling of not being personally regarded as a full member of society. This motivates people to make sense of their situation, but from a position of discomfort and negative emotion that breeds a suspicious attitude – a perfect pot in which to brew conspiracy. The second is a broader concern about the treatment of their minority group, which explains why, in the US, research has found that affluent African Americans with greater access to participation in society are as likely as their poorer counterparts to believe in conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Prooijen’s team recognised that these two factors, as well as making minorities susceptible to specific conspiracies targeted towards the identity group, could easily generalise. After all, every conspiracy theory needs its perpetrators – powerful figures in the majority group who are pulling the strings. And once you buy in to the idea that such figures exist and are shaping the world in nefarious ways, then you have opened the door to a broader conspiratorial world-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, the researchers looked at how conspiratorial beliefs were associated with Muslim and also ethnic minority status. They combined a sample acquired through social media with a group drawn from voters for a Dutch party popular among Muslim minorities, which amounted to 205 Muslim participants, most of whom were also from a minority ethnic group, and 146 non-muslims, of which 44 were from an ethnic minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated their belief in thirteen different conspiracies, which came from four categories. One category involved Muslim victims – for example in this category was the claim that the US carried out 9/11 to make Islam look bad and invade the Middle East. Another category was centred on Jewish antagonists, such as the claim that Jewish bankers are controlling the world economy, which is another common theme in established Muslim conspiratorial beliefs. The two remaining categories were not tied to prototypical Muslim themes, being either economic (the medical industry is hiding the cure for cancer to maximise their revenue) or from the vast roster of unclassifiable conspiracies, such as: there were UFOs at Roswell; Diana was murdered by the royals; and the media are controlled by a left-wing elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Prooijen’s team found that Muslim participants not only tended to believe more strongly in conspiracies directly related to their identity, but also in the economic and miscellaneous conspiracies too. Moreover, strength of conspiracy belief (of all forms) was driven by the two factors previously associated with endorsement of identity-specific conspiracy belief – levels of personal deprivation (measured through giving a low rating to the item: “To what extent do you feel like a Dutch citizen?”) and group deprivation as measured by strength of agreement with items like “I believe Islam is being suppressed in the West.” Independently of Muslim religion, the same pattern was found for the effect of being a member of an ethnic minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are prompted to think of prominent conspiracists, for many of us the first names that come to mind&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;are probably white men like Alex Jones or David Icke, making it easy to assume that in the West it is the White majority who are more prone to conspiracy beliefs. But this is likely the “availability bias” at work (these names are simply the easiest to think of), or due to the fact these men have figured out how to monetise conspiracy. The new findings, though preliminary and limited by being based in a single European country, suggest in fact it is minorities who are more likely to endorse conspiracy-based explanations.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If further research supports this assertion, it would make sense of something I read recently about Dylan Avery, the US film-maker behind &lt;i&gt;Loose Change&lt;/i&gt;, a film that questioned the official account of 9/11 and which many consider a catalyst for the conspiracy movement. Avery went on to make a film about police brutality in Black communities, and he was initially wary of mentioning his past work, afraid of the reputation it had accrued – but in fact found that he got &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; interviews with African Americans if he mentioned his prior work on 9/11. This fits with the new findings that suggest majorities in society have less incentive to question the status quo, while it’s those feeling marginalised who are likely to spy something going on behind the scenes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3442&quot;&gt;Increased conspiracy beliefs among ethnic and Muslim minorities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Below are the first two paragraphs. The full review can be read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QkUdv2KATnc/W6s7rsyQQbI/AAAAAAAAgK0/ixl-RPt8tkwcIR8f_03n6I6tBvwjF_3YgCLcBGAs/s1600/paywall.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QkUdv2KATnc/W6s7rsyQQbI/AAAAAAAAgK0/ixl-RPt8tkwcIR8f_03n6I6tBvwjF_3YgCLcBGAs/s1600/paywall.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billed as a documentary, &lt;i&gt;Paywall&lt;/i&gt; would be more accurately described as an advocacy film. Its intention seems to be to persuade viewers that the paywalls that restrict access to journal content online are an unnecessary hangover from the print era, and now serve only to perpetuate the excessive profits that legacy publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley and Springer Nature make from the public purse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The film makes a convincing case that the paywall system creates problems — and that universal open access (OA) to scholarly articles would be better for society. But it fails to adequately explore the thorny challenges that arise with OA publishing. These include the fact that the publishers castigated by the film would continue to dominate scholarly communication in an OA world; the increasingly expensive ‘pay-to-publish’ model, which substitutes inequities in access for inequities in affording publication; and the rise of predatory publishing. And although &lt;i&gt;Paywall&lt;/i&gt; acknowledges that current reward systems have slowed the progress of OA publishing, it does not address the puzzling question of why academics have proved so reluctant to make copies of their published papers freely available in their institutional repositories ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Power to the Preprint: An Update</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/7EgWj9k0ttQ/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we partnered with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to provide authors the opportunity to post their manuscripts as a preprint on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; through our submission system. In July, we started to implement a new feature linking PLOS articles to their matching bioRxiv preprint—regardless of whether they were submitted through the PLOS integration. This means any article published in a PLOS journal will be linked to its bioRxiv preprint, if posted, and adds on to the existing links from bioRxiv preprints to their journal publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the benefit? For starters, it ensures that the early impact of the preprint is visible alongside the publication and enables the reader to learn the paper’s history. Forming these links shows more of the vital history of a research work, with a public life that started as a preprint, was shared online, and continued through peer review to journal publication. By linking papers with their preprints, we hope to make an important part of the paper’s life cycle accessible to our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/preprints&quot;&gt;support preprints&lt;/a&gt; as a vital part of the scientific literature. Preprints enable authors to get results out early, gain feedback on their manuscript from a wider community, accrue citations and time stamp their work. Preprints are indexed in Crossref and Google Scholar so they form a documented part of the ‘research story’ for the journal publications that may follow them. In the future we’ll work toward forming links with more preprint servers to ensure this feature is utilized across servers and scientific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our preprint service is free of charge and automated. All you have to do is opt-in when submitting your paper. The feature includes creation of a Preprint PDF from the author’s submission files (optional), screening checks and a seamless deposit to bioRxiv to make this process as easy as possible. Authors can focus on their journal submission, knowing their results will soon be available online as they work through the review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine continues to permit authors to post preprints of their research, but given the particular issues related to research in human health, does not currently offer transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the strength of the widely endorsed Big Five model of personality is its efficient explanatory power – in the traits of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, it removes the redundancy of more fine-grained approaches and manages to capture the most meaningful variance in our habits of thought and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to make then of the popular proposal that what marks out high achievers from the rest is that they rank highly on another trait labelled as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;Grit”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the recognition of Grit, and the development of a scale to measure it, a breakthrough in our understanding of the psychology of success? Or is it a reinvention of the wheel, a redundant addition to the taxonomy of personality psychology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the US-based authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29674-001&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the topic concluded “that Grit as currently measured is simply a repackaging of Conscientiousness”. Now a different research team, based in Germany and Switzerland, has taken a more intricate look at the links between Grit and Conscientiousness, this time including a focus on their respective facets (or sub-traits). Writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2171&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fabian Schmidt and his colleagues conclude that “Grit represents yet another contribution to the common problem of redundant labelling of constructs in personality psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34810&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt’s team asked two samples of hundreds of participants (one made up of school pupils, average age 15; the other a diverse group of adults, average age 32) to complete: a German version of the original brief Grit scale, which consists of 4 items tapping &lt;em&gt;perseverance&lt;/em&gt; in the face of adversity, and 4 tapping focus and &lt;em&gt;consistency&lt;/em&gt; of interests; and a German version of the 48 Conscientiousness items from the NEO-PIR (a well-established and validated scale based on the Big Five model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used advanced statistical techniques to see how much variance in participants’ answers on one of the scales overlapped with the variance in their answers on the other – to oversimplify, this provided a measure of redundancy or whether the two scales were essentially measuring the same constructs or not – and, unlike in prior research, this included making detailed comparisons between the global traits (Grit and Conscientiousness) and their respective facets (perseverance and consistency in the case of Grit; and competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline and deliberation in the case of Conscientiousness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the perseverance facet of Grit (which past studies have suggested is responsible for most of the links between Grit and later success) shared 95 per cent of its variance with trait Conscientiousness and with its “pro-active” facets – that is, all those sub-traits that pertain to being industrious and driven. The global Grit trait (incorporating both its facets) similarly shared a large amount of variance with Conscientiousness and with its pro-active facets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Grit, and especially its perseverance facet, are really just tapping into the pro-active aspects of Conscientiousness that are to do with being industrious and achievement focused (as opposed to the inhibitive aspects, which are more about orderliness and self-control). “Claiming that grit is just proactive Conscientiousness or industriousness … would stand in accordance with our findings,” the researchers said. Put differently, the findings suggest that proponents of Grit are falling for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle-jangle_fallacies&quot;&gt;jangle fallacy&lt;/a&gt; – mistakenly believing they are measuring something different because they have given a new name to an existing concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was a little more complicated for the consistency facet of Grit, which is to do with staying focused on one or only a few interests. Past research has shown that this facet is far less relevant to, or predictive of, future success than perseverance. Here it shared 69 per cent of its variance with Conscientiousness, suggesting that it overlapped with this trait but was also measuring something else besides. However, it remains for future research to establish whether consistency should ideally be incorporated into the Big Five model as an extra Conscientiousness facet (after all, the existing Conscientiousness facets also display their own unique variance suggesting they measure Conscientiousness plus a little of something else) or whether it is actually better placed elsewhere, as a facet associated with low Neuroticism, for example, or even low Openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt and his team concluded that perseverance, the facet of Grit that has received most attention because of its links with success and achievement, is a redundant concept.  It is really just another word for industriousness, which is already a well-researched and recognised aspect of the pro-active side of Conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To waive the use of some of the redundant labels would enhance the clarity and consistency of research in personality psychology,” they said. On a more positive note, they added that the 4 items of the brief Grit scale that tap perseverance seem to provide an incredibly concise measure of industriousness or pro-active Conscientiousness, making the Grit scale possibly “one of the most economic ways currently available” to measure these important constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2171&quot;&gt;Same Same, but Different? Relations Between Facets of Conscientiousness and Grit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to someone new can be daunting, but such conversations “have the power to turn strangers into friends, coffee dates into marriages, and interviews into jobs,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618783714&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, which has found that perhaps we shouldn’t feel so anxious about them. Across five studies, the researchers explored what strangers thought about each other after chatting, and they found consistent evidence for what they call a “liking gap” – other people like us more than we think. Though in other areas of life many of us have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/05/the-brain-basis-of-unrealistic-optimism/&quot;&gt;rosy-tinted view of our abilities&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that we tend to&lt;i&gt; under&lt;/i&gt;-estimate how we come across socially.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34785&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first study, Erica Boothby at Cornell University, US, and her fellow researchers simply paired up 34 students for a guided conversation (with ice-breaker questions provided) for five minutes, and got them to complete some personality scales and ratings of the conversation, including what they thought of their partner and how they imagined their partner would rate them. The researchers found that the participants significantly under-estimated how much their partner liked them. And the analysis of the personality data revealed one key driver: the shyer the person, the bigger the liking gap (only for those who ranked low for shyness did the gap disappear entirely).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, of a fresh group of 84 students, explored the potential role of negative thoughts in accounting for the gap. As the researchers note, when we talk to someone we don’t know too well, we often worry about whether we’re coming across as over-chatty, perhaps, or boring. And afterwards, many people have a tendency to be self-critical, focusing on what they did wrong, and judging themselves harshly – thinking perhaps that they talked too much about themselves, or that they did a bad job at telling a joke.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in this second study were asked to talk for five minutes with their partner about whatever they wanted. When they reflected on the conversation afterwards, they reported that, while they were talking, their thoughts about how the other person was viewing them were more negative than their thoughts about their partner&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; –&lt;/span&gt; and this difference was related to how much they believed the other person liked them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third study, the researchers asked pairs of strangers (from the general public and students) to talk together for as long as they liked, for up to 45 minutes. Whether the conversation lasted 2 or 45 minutes, the liking gap remained. This study also revealed an “enjoyment gap”: regardless of the length of the conversation, the participants under-estimated how much their partner enjoyed it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth and fifth studies moved the investigation out of the lab, into real-world settings: workshops for entrepreneurs and members of the British public on “how to talk to strangers”, and into first-year dormitory suites at Yale University. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop data (involving 100 people) showed that participants tended to predict that their conversation partner would find them less interesting than they would find their partner to be – a mistaken belief that was magnified after the conversation. The dorm study, meanwhile, surveyed new students at the start of the fall semester, in September, and then at four further points until May and found that they under-estimated how much their suite-mates liked them at all of the time-points except for the final one. Clearly, the liking gap can persist for a long time.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Conversation appears to be a domain in which people display uncharacteristic pessimism about their performance,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be adaptive in a way because a bias toward reflecting on our conversational mistakes might prompt us to perform better next time. Strangers, on the other hand, are judging us according a different metric – they have no idea of the performance we’re aiming for, and so no clue when we fall short of that target – making them less critical. And they probably didn’t have high expectations at the outset. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/&quot;&gt;People’s predictions about how rewarding it will be to talk to someone new&lt;/a&gt; are, as the researchers write, often “pretty dismal…So whereas speakers are thinking that they have failed to live up to their ideal, listeners are thinking that it could have been much worse, and this different standard of comparison for oneself and for others may well be one reason that people underestimate how much their conversation partners enjoy their company.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of data from the first study also suggests that because we’re often so wrapped up in thinking about our own performance, and what to say next, we neglect to notice signals from the other person that indicate that they’re actually enjoying the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main message from these five studies? In the researchers’ words: “others like us more than we know.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: A call for unity at TERMIS 2018</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/09/24/call-unity-termis-2018/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/IMG_0093-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;TERMIS 2018 took place during early September in the beautiful city of Kyoto, Japan, a place with a staggering collection of 1,600 temples, filled with UNESCO World Heritage sites and a history of more than 1,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting kicked off with the arrival of typhoon Jebi and despite the hindering conditions, the organizers, led by the Conference Chairs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.infront.kyoto-u.ac.jp/te02/members/tabata/tabata3_en.html&quot;&gt;Prof Yasuhiko Tabata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dma.jim.osaka-u.ac.jp/view?l=en&amp;amp;u=8183&quot;&gt;Prof Yoshiki Sawa&lt;/a&gt; (also the President of the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine) in an admirable effort, ensured that all of the sessions went ahead uninterrupted, in what resulted to be an outstanding venue for ideas exchange and productive debate around the field’s highest accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A unified approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s theme was “Integration of Industry, Government, and Academia for Regenerative Medicine”. The theme echoed across the duration of the meeting, with academic, governmental and industry experts leading discussions across all aspects of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day was centered on TERMEX 2018, an industry event aimed at sharing the latest updates on the industrialization, regulation, market insights, international development and other surrounding issues in TERM. We were privileged to learn about the different opportunities and challenges that companies face across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10531&quot; style=&quot;width: 262px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10531&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/AdobeStock_105213967-e1537780297627-252x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;252&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: © Sergey Nivens / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talk that stood out was one by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccrm.ca/michael_may&quot;&gt;Dr Michael May&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccrm.ca/&quot;&gt;CCRM&lt;/a&gt;, a not-for-profit organization supporting companies to develop and commercialize cell and gene therapy technologies in Canada. He characterized regenerative medicine as the hottest area in biotech and one that has achieved elevated business activity through capital efficient collaborative models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ct.catapult.org.uk/about-us/our-team/our-management-team&quot;&gt;Dr Michael Bennet&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://catapult.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt;, a center helping cell and gene therapy organisations worldwide develop early stage research into commercial products, emphasized that therapies are extraordinarily expensive, with complex process controls and supply chains. Innovators need to seek advice early on to ensure that their products adhere to the highest standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weisslab.net/&quot;&gt;Prof Anthony Weiss&lt;/a&gt; (University of Sydney), founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elastagen.com/&quot;&gt;elastagen&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian company with an array of products based on elastin (a critical component of human tissues), gave an inspiring talk around how our aging population creates a demand for novel, effective and easily translatable technologies in skin and aesthetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing the boundaries of science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly anticipated Presidential address by &lt;a href=&quot;https://3bs.uminho.pt/users/rgreis&quot;&gt;Prof Rui Reis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://3bs.uminho.pt/&quot;&gt;3B’s Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, University of Minho) was undeniably one of the meeting’s highlights. His talk radiated a tone of optimism for rapid future developments in the field, and presented some of his group’s pioneering work on natural origin materials, their approach in scaffold design and processing, as well as their design of a multi chamber bioreactor for 3D hierarchical cell cultures, a device that has already resulted in a spin-out company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synergistic nature of the field is evident in the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioengineering.rice.edu/antonios-g-mikos&quot;&gt;Prof Antonios Mikos&lt;/a&gt; (Rice University). His talk on ‘In vivo Bioreactors for Craniofacial Tissue Regeneration’ showcased research conducted in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afirm.mil/&quot;&gt;Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (AFIRM) that aims to accelerate regenerative medicine solutions for the treatment of battlefield injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of their major accomplishments include the development of space maintainers (non-degradable materials that keep the area for regeneration empty), which in combination with in vivo bioreactor technologies form a holistic personalized medicine strategy for the regeneration of multiple tissues (including bone, nerves, vascular system, soft tissue, etc.) that can integrate with the mandible and achieve functional tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10526 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/42490-Image-211x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;The scientific sessions were varied and impressive and unfortunately it is impossible to mention all of the ones that stood out. However, we were honored to attend a session chaired by our very own &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Editors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nuigalway.ie/engineering-informatics/biomedical-engineering/research/researchtopics/drdimitrioszeugolis/&quot;&gt;Prof Dimitrios Zeugolis&lt;/a&gt; (NUI Galway) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://3bs.uminho.pt/users/megomes&quot;&gt;Prof Manuela Gomes&lt;/a&gt; (University of Minho). In particular, the session’s keynote talk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/hutmache/&quot;&gt;Prof Dietmar Hutmacher&lt;/a&gt; (Queensland University of Technology) on ‘Animal models in clinical translation and commercialization of TE and RM therapies – myths and reality’ didn’t fail to impress, as he described some of his group’s approaches on the critical topic of clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the array of industrial difficulties (process complexity, high costs, strict regulatory diligence, etc.) that TERM faces in transferring its research and new technologies to the clinic, one needs to acknowledge that it is a purposeful and close-knit community that has recognized some of the field’s grand challenges and now unifies to pursue them. We very much look forward to future developments at TERMIS 2021 and the progress towards the field’s common goal, the improvement of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springer Nature @ TERMIS 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10524 alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Prof-Redl-e1537522218169-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most highlighted academic resource at the meeting, which even received an honorable mention during the Presidential address, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en/team/mitarbeiter/univ-prof-dr-heinz-redl&quot;&gt;Prof Heinz Redl&lt;/a&gt;’s new book on ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319454436&quot;&gt;3D Printing and Biofabrication&lt;/a&gt;’, published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gb&quot;&gt;Springer&lt;/a&gt;, which forms part of a series of 15 books on ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/series/13441&quot;&gt;Tissue Engineering and Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;’. Our Editorial Advisor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tissuemodulation.com/mira.html&quot;&gt;Prof Michael Raghunath&lt;/a&gt; (Zurich University of Applied Sciences), has authored an excellent chapter on macromolecular crowding for tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Heinz Redl is the current Chair for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.termis.org/chapters-europe&quot;&gt;TERMIS-Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en&quot;&gt;the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Experimental and Clinical Traumatology&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.traumacareconsult.com/&quot;&gt;Trauma Care Consult&lt;/a&gt; and a collaborator of numerous major industrial partners. We were privileged to host this book at the Springer Nature booth and speak with countless academics and industry representatives, who were interested to learn more about it. We will soon be publishing an exclusive interview with Prof Redl and discuss future developments in the field, his work at TERMIS, his recent book and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, this year’s TERMIS World Congress featured a highly anticipated session by the Chief Editor for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/about/editors&quot;&gt;Dr. Pep Pamies&lt;/a&gt;, on ‘The Diversifying Nature of Impact’. The talk dissected impact factor and challenged its historical use in the assessment of researchers and articles. He suggested data-driven alternative metrics, including qualitative measures and provided a more holistic view for the nature of impact. This is a true testament to the ethos of the journal and its pioneering work beyond citations and towards the &lt;em&gt;facilitation&lt;/em&gt; of truly ground-breaking research. The interested reader may refer to his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0189-y&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While I was busy working an office job and preparing for a web development bootcamp (sorry, PhD… maybe later!) neuroscientists all over the world were busy discovering cool stuff. Like, did you know FDA approved psychedelic therapy trials for depression? Or that we as a humanity managed to start reversing blindness in mice? Or what octopuses do after you give them MDMA? Hopefully you didn’t. But even if you did, read on to find out even more cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some really good news. Scientists from the University of Leeds kicked cancer in the balls. Or, more scientifically speaking, aggressive brain tumor cells were forced to self-destruct after being exposed to a specific synthetic chemical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111643&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[1].&lt;/a&gt; Glioblastoma, the cancer in question, is a real bitch -- it is hard to treat and hard to survive. Originally, the authors just wanted to test whether this synthetic molecule would have a therapeutic effect and slow the cancer down; what they got, however, was something even better. The said chemical had a toxic effect on the cancer cells and basically just messed with their mitochondria (powerhouse of the cell!). This shut down the energy supply of the cells and led to their destruction. Moreover, the scientists tested whether this chemical can cross the blood-brain-barrier, a border that separates circulating blood from our precious brain, by first introducing glioblastoma into mice and then injecting them with the chemical. And indeed: it successfully crossed the barrier and decreased the tumor growth by around 50%. Also good to mention that normal brain cells were unaffected by the killer molecule. It is still a long way before human trials are approved but it is extremely promising. In your face, cancer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for everyone's favorite topic of psychedelics (favorite to the extent of me getting mails from random dudes asking where to get DMT… Not the fame I asked for). First off, neuroscientists at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who normally study social behavior of animals decided to go one (or rather hundred) step(s) further and to give MDMA to octopuses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30991-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[2].&lt;/a&gt; Ecstasy is known to make people extraverted, sociable, happy and longing for physical touch and the researchers wondered whether the drug would have the same effect on the social behavior of species which is a) completely different to humans and b) is known to live a solitary life and not being super social (now I’m bitter the labs I worked in never had such brilliant ideas). First off, the scientists analyzed the octopus genom and found out that they also have genes that create serotonin transporters in the brain (serotonin is the neurotransmitter which gets released in excessive amounts after taking ecstasy). They proceeded by adding ecstasy in water tanks and see there — octopuses started telling all their friends they love them while listening to techno. Or almost — they started spending more time with the fellow octopuses and even touching each other and other objects not just with one but with as many as six tentacles. Also this happened: “Another octopus was doing backflips and looked like he was playing in the water, but we don't have good ways of quantifying that.&quot;. Well, if that isn’t what I see in Berlin clubs. Overall, the scientists believe that serotonin does play an important role in the social behavior of octopuses just like it does in humans. Moreover, despite the huge differences between our brains (as the octopuses don’t have a cortex or a reward circuit like we do) it seems like the social behavior is built in on the molecular level. It is incredible that a creature with a brain which developed completely different from our own reacts to a drug in the same way — and indicates that the brain pathways of social behavior may have arisen in our common ancestor (which is more than 500 million years ago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for human studies. For one, researchers have found that taking DMT induces a state which is very similar to the near death experience (NDE) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[3].&lt;/a&gt; In order to find that out they asked people who actually experienced NDE and people whom they gave DMT to fill out a standardized questionnaire trying to grasp their experience and then compared them. Turns out, that all the people who took DMT scored above the threshold for determining an NDE; meaning that DMT seems to be able to mimic content and intensity of almost dying. The shared experiences included being in an unearthly environment, feeling peace, separating from your own body and encountering some kind of a ~~mysterious God-like entity~~. Next step would be to compare the MRI scans of both groups in order to see whether the a DMT high and an NDE share a neuroscientific basis -- and then we can step by step understand the psychology and biology of dying better. These findings alone are, however, already important, as they show that an NDE happens not because God is getting to ready to welcome Her child but because of our neurons in our brains firing in a specific way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) has recently approved a trial where psilocybin (the main ingredient in magic mushrooms) is gonna be used to treat depression &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-receives-fda-approval-for-psilocybin-therapy-clinical-trial-for-treatment-resistant-depression-691452071.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the recent psychedelic Renaissance (I wrote about it here — &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click!&lt;/a&gt;) it is known that psilocybin, LSD and ayahuasca have an immense potential to treat mental diseases (again, briefly described &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or if you want more hit me up for a research paper I wrote for the uni on this topic), so that it’s only logical that FDA gives a green light for a phase two trial. 216 patients with treatment-resistant depression will participate in the study where they will receive doses of the drug coupled with therapy sessions. If the trial is successful it can mean a marketing authorization in two to three years which is a huge revolution in depression treatment: psychedelics act fast, the effect lasts long and the side effects are virtually non-existent (if done in a controlled medical setting of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, blindness has received a kick in the private areas as well: researchers have successfully reversed congenital blindness in mice by manipulating cells in their retina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=30111842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. To do that, they used gene therapy and transformed supportive cells called Müller glia (which normally just care about retina being stable) into photoreceptors, the light-sensitive cells that actually allow us to see. Photoreceptors themselves cannot regenerate, whereas Müller cells have been shown to divide in response to injury and regenerate into photoreceptors and other retinal cells (this was shown in zebrafish, but still). With some gene therapy magic the scientists first forced the Müller cells to divide and then injected mice’ eyes with chemicals forcing the freshly divided cells to become something completely different. The newly created photoreceptors did not differ in structure from the normal ones; moreover, they functioned just as well! They were communicating with other photoreceptors and successfully transmitting the light signals to the brain. Now the scientists are running behavioral studies in order to test the performance of mice who regained their vision in tasks that require eyesight (big if true). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year three quarters of a million people take their own lives, and suicide is the leading cause of death in adolescents. Non-lethal self-harm is also prolific, leading annually to around 300,000 UK hospital visits, with even more going unreported. Knowing who is at most risk can inform support and prevention efforts. The higher rates of self-harm in LGBT and minority groups are well-established, and now a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12179&quot;&gt;review article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/i&gt; identifies other groups, including goths, emos and metalheads, who may also be at increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34778&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British team, led by Mairead Anne Hughes at the University of Liverpool, searched both quantitative and qualitative papers on suicide and self-harm to find those that measured affiliation to a subculture – defined as marking oneself out through particular clothes, makeup, body art and musical preferences. They identified ten relevant papers, all but one involving people under 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quantitative research, a number of studies categorised participants based purely on their musical preferences (for example, based on subscriptions to &lt;i&gt;Metal Edge&lt;/i&gt; magazine). These studies showed small associations between being a heavy metal fan and greater suicidal ideation and risk. However, in the one study that accounted for potential confounders, like having a negligent father and substance use, the link disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at alternative subculture membership more generally, the team found two studies suggesting that moderate or stronger identification with a subculture is associated with a three times higher risk of self-harm and six times higher risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation could simply be that people who self harm are more likely to gravitate to these subcultures. Consistent with this interpretation, the studies found associations between subculture membership and various pre-existing adversities, including bullying, difficult family relationships, and emotional and behavioural difficulties. On the other hand, several studies found that controlling for these pre-existing adversities did not eliminate the sub-culture/self-harm association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even stronger evidence comes from a longitudinal study of around 4,000 young people that found as participants became more affiliated with the subculture, their odds of self-harm increased, even after adjusting for factors like previous depression, victimisation, and history of self-harm. So this makes it unlikely that the sub-culture association with self-harm could be due entirely to selection effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves two other major explanations. One is that self-harm is the consequence of the unasked for social consequences of being an emo, goth, or metaller – such as stigma, hate crime, and victimisation. The other is that subculture membership, by its very nature, encourages self-harm by modelling these behaviours in lyrics and through the example set by leading figures.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two qualitative papers explored this latter possibility, based on analysis of internet forum comments and on interviews with emo adolescents. Their conclusions support the idea that self-harm and suicide are accepted and normalised in these subcultures, including praising of acts of self harm. But Hughes and her colleagues wondered if the data could have been interpreted differently, and they noted that online chat forums have a “performative quality” that doesn’t always give the best sense of what is really going on in people’s lives. Also, it’s worth noting that a fascination with suicide and self-harm can also be found in mainstream culture, such as in the recent Netflix hit &lt;i&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who grew up in alternative subcultures I can see the reasons for concern about contagion and modelling. I remember the breathless reporting around Manic Street Preachers’ guitarist Richey Edward’s cutting, and the preoccupation with the destruction of the body found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_(1993_film)&quot;&gt;industrial music.&lt;/a&gt; But what resonates with me even more is when Hughes and her colleagues note how alternative culture uses morbid imagery and content in a self-aware, playful and even deflationary way. For instance, they may be dark, but the songs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Infirmary&quot;&gt;From Here to Infirmary&lt;/a&gt; by punk/emo band Alkaline Trio, are as wry as the title. Talking about ugly or dangerous thoughts can put them into perspective, and to laugh at it can banish it. As we’ve reported before, there is evidence that having heavy metal in your life &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/04/the-scaremongers-were-wrong-metalheads-from-the-80s-are-thriving/&quot;&gt;can actually be a protective factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their current research review, Hughes and her team conclude that “there is currently not adequate evidence to draw conclusions that these alternative subcultures themselves are in any way harmful.” But being a member is associated with elevated risks, some of which accrue over time, which is enough of a reason to give it our attention. This could be through addressing stigmatisation; providing education for people who work with youth from these groups about warning signs and routes for accessing support; and providing psychology services that appeal to people who may be anti-establishment in temperament, but who could do with help in processing what they need to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12179&quot;&gt;This corrosion: A systematic review of the association between alternative subcultures and the risk of self‐harm and suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Shortly before his death, he helped prepare this obituary—his last chance to help correct the perverse incentives that too often influence the conduct and reporting of scientific research.&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barney rejected grand biological theories that offered neat, simple-but-wrong explanations of psychopathology. Ever aware of the complexity of the human brain, he was an early rejecter of blind optimism that any simple imbalance of monoamine transmitters could account for the wide variety of mental disorders. More recently, he deplored the ubiquitous hype that suggested that genetics or neuroimaging or big data mining could provide simple answers to deeply complex questions. He predicted—presciently—that these powerful new tools would have great difficulty in producing solid, replicable findings that could be translated to clinical practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Conveyor belt psychiatry or game changer? iTBS v rTMS are equivalent for MDD... but no active comparator.

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: MPFI Welcomes 70 Aspiring Scientists to “Career Day”</title>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/mpfi-welcomes-70-aspiring-scientists-to-career-day/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) hosted 70 local high school students and their teachers for Career Day, which took place on Saturday, September 15, 2018. Students and teachers enjoyed tours of MPFI facilities, a luncheon with scientists, and an interactive question and answer session. The 2018 panelists were Dr. Lesly Colgan, Dr. Michael Yetman, and Kate Maximov. The discussion was facilitated by Dr. Madineh Sarvestani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Career Day” is an annual event that gives high school students the opportunity to meet and interact with Max Planck scientists. Panelists traditionally include scientists who are in different stages of their training, from post-baccalaureate students to postdoctoral fellows. 2018’s Career Panel discussion explored many topics, including what inspired the scientists to choose a career in science, overcoming the challenges of being a woman in science, and what educational and research experiences got the researchers to the place that they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback from both teachers and students was overwhelmingly positive. “It was an amazing experience I won’t forget as I move on in life. Hopefully, I’ll be back someday,” said student Doris Yang from Jupiter High School.  Her teacher Shari Rogers added, “Thank you for your amazing community outreach!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate in career day, teachers had to submit an application explaining how their students would benefit from the experience. Once selected, each school could choose ten students to attend. The schools and teachers selected for 2018 included: Steven Weber and Tamica Williams, Village Academy; Mary Paramore, Marie Dupuy and Dr. Robert Grassemi, Inlet Groove High School; Shari Rodgers, Jupiter High School; Melinda Ogden, Atlantic Community High School; Marilyn Budensiek, Hobe Sound Christian Academy; Renee Szeliga, Benjamin School; Mira Dohnd, the Conservatory School of North Palm Beach; and Ofelia Barletta Chacon, Palm Beach Gardens High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s Career Day was held as a satellite event of the international Max Planck Society’s “Max Planck Day,” which is recognized throughout Germany in 2018 as a way to mark jubilee celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Max Planck’s Nobel prize for physics, the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Max Planck Society, and Max Planck’s 160th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;And end dumb arguments about metaphors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*jKAc1FH4dDJUW3dWLLbFJg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;A room full of computers, and their brains.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Your brain is a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple metaphor causes raging arguments, intellectual duels, and the throwing of insults. On the one side, those aghast at the idea that the richness, imagination, and ineffability of the human mind could possibly arise from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer&quot;&gt;something as prosaic&lt;/a&gt; as a machine pumping out a string of 0s and 1s. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/opinion/sunday/face-it-your-brain-is-a-computer.html&quot;&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt;, those aghast at the aghast, at how anyone could deny the human brain is the most wonderful information processor in the universe, and that computers can do anything they put their mind too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguments over the “brain as computer” metaphor are idiotic. Because it’s not a metaphor: it’s a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wrong metaphor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to have an argument about the computer metaphor, you first have to define “computer”. Let’s get the easy bit out of the way: what a computer is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer is not the box on your desk, the tablet on your lap, or the phone in your hand right now. Assemblages of electronics with microchips, RAM, and caches: these are a particular hardware realisation of a computer. If you think the computer metaphor is about a hunk of plastic and sand, and go “aha! The brain is not like a hunk of plastic and sand”, then, well done, you’re right. But not in a useful way. It is self-evident, for example, that the brain does not have a separate chunk of grey matter that acts as a hard drive for long term storage of memories when someone turns off your power (because if someone turns off your power, you’re dead). &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer&quot;&gt;Some rejectors&lt;/a&gt; of the computer metaphor have made this error, confusing the box on their desk with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other staunch rejectors argue the computer metaphor is just another in a long line of metaphors describing the brain using the brightest new technology of the time. They reel off a litany of metaphors used to describe the brain over the past few centuries: hydraulics, telegraphs, telephone switchboards — and now computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is dumb. The computer-brain comparison &lt;strong&gt;is not a metaphor for technology&lt;/strong&gt;. The comparison is about the formal definition of a computer. Alan Turing formally defined a computer in 1936. John Von Neumann laid out the architecture for modern electronic computer hardware in 1945. General purpose hardware computers did not exist until the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians can (and do) argue all day about what was the first official electronic computer. But they all agree that, whatever it was, it was not built before 1936. Indeed Turing’s work was about humans: about capturing our capacity to solve problems, to compute, using a logical sequence of steps (like, say, adding up two numbers) in some formal maths. Computers were defined before the technology we now call a “computer” even existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Did someone say “Babbage”? The Difference Engine was a remarkable calculator, but a calculator nonetheless; the Analytical Engine was never built; both were mechanical. Still the mere existence of the plans for the Analytical Engine helped define the idea of a machine for computing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly galling is that the metaphor is the wrong way round: the electronic computer is a brain. Von Neumann based some of his ideas for the architecture of the electronic computer on a model of the brain advanced by McCulloch and Pitts. They pointed out that neurons either send their electrical “spike”, or they don’t. So you can think of a neuron as encoding a 1 (meaning “true”) by sending a spike, or a 0 (meaning “false”) when it doesn’t. From this assumption it follows that groups of neurons sending 0s and 1s to each other can make all the formal statements of logic. Which is rather useful for computing stuff. Von Neumann knew McCulloch well, and read their paper; he then used the ideas of encoding 0s and 1s in elements of a circuit, and of how to combine these elements to do logic, in his architecture for a computer. Computer hardware has some foundations in brain science, not the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And, just to be clear, this also does not mean that the brain is a computer. Von Neumann was using a simple analogy for how neurons could be interpreted. But this interpretation completely ignores many basic things about neurons. Like neurons having a constant output for example: McCulloch and Pitts’ model just assumed either a 1 or a 0, and nothing else, during a particular computation; but neurons send spikes all the time. Indeed von Neumann noted some of the ways his computer was not like a brain in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;amp;d=1&quot;&gt;original EDVAC report&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when we say “the brain is a computer”, what do we mean? What is a computer in this metaphor? A machine for executing an algorithm: a (universal) Turing Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pedants corner: this is not the only definition of a computer. But it is the definition that gives an intuitive understanding of how to define such a thing, and obviously fits with the pile of plastic and sand we call a “computer”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key ingredients are simple. In this definition, we require only the following. Input, in the form of symbols. Somewhere to write more symbols (Turing imagined an infinite length of paper tape. You could use strawberry liquorice laces at a pinch). A set of instructions — an algorithm — for turning the input symbols into the desired output symbols, by writing as many intermediate symbols as you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is at the heart of it: a set of steps, that each define a single action. That are discrete: do A then B then C. You can have as many steps as you like. You can have all the loops back and forth between the steps that you like, as in the toddler algorithm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) run into wall;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) rub head;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) repeat from (1);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have as many branching options of steps as you like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) if HUNGRY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1b) buy burrito;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) else if THIRSTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2b) buy smoothie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) else&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3b) “please leave the shop, you’re disturbing the customers”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the steps are always discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For the completists, the Church-Turing thesis guarantees that such a machine with an infinite capacity to write symbols will complete any algorithm with a stopping condition in finite time. Assuming you wrote the algorithm correctly in the first place. Which you didn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “brain as computer” hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the crux. The brain does not have discrete steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a system of continuous dynamics. Inside a neuron is a constant diffusion of calcium, potassium, sodium, and chlorine (and innumerable proteins causing changes in its receptors and structure). The resultant small flickers of the voltage across a neuron’s membrane are continual, ongoing. When this flickering voltage reaches a tipping point a neuron will fire a spike. The spike will cause flickers of voltage in the target neurons it reaches. Circuits of neurons endlessly, continuously send spikes to each other. All these things are continuous, not discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the sending of spikes is not discrete. We may argue that a single spike is a discrete thing, a “1” as envisaged by McCulloch and Pitts. But they are not sent in discrete steps; they are generated in continuous time. So neurons communicate in continuous time, not in discrete steps. And how neurons communicate with each other is precisely what we’re arguing about when we talk about brains “computing” or not. For neurons sending spikes to each other is how you walk, see, and smell; think, plan, and do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’ve just defined a computer as something that executes an algorithm with discrete steps. Ergo, the brain is not a computer, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. Yes, there are trivial ways in which the brain is not a universal Turing machine. The brain does not have unbounded memory. Nor does it have unbounded time in which to carry out any computation. But then, neither does a hardware electronic computer. It may feel like it takes an infinite amount of time to run the algorithm for Windows Update, but it is not, technically speaking, infinite. It will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But saying “the brain is a computer” is an hypothesis. It is asking the question: can the sending of spikes between neurons (and all the things affecting the sending of spikes) approximate an algorithm? Or are the dynamics themselves the goal of the brain, and so can’t be described as an algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which answer we give has ramifications for how we could understand the brain. If the brain is approximating algorithms, operating as if it were a computer, then we can use all the machinery of our knowledge of algorithms to study it. But if it is not approximating algorithms, then we need a completely different formal approach to understanding the brain, one not based on computing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So which is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, the brain runs algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to test if a set of neurons in the brain are approximating an algorithm. Either we can propose an algorithm that fits with the way an animal behaves, and then see if the activity of neurons approximates that algorithm. Or, we can measure the activity of neurons during a behaviour, and then see what algorithm this activity approximates. We have examples of both. Let’s take an example where we’ve derived an algorithm from behaviour first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know a lot about how animals — including us — behave when deciding between two equally dull options. Indeed there is a panoply of experimental tasks where we ask the subject to make a choice between two options based on the evidence available to them. For example, we often show primates (including us) a set of randomly moving dots, within which are embedded a few dots all moving in the same direction — either left, or right. And we ask the primate to decide which direction (left or right) those few coherent dots are moving in. So the primate stares at the screen for a while, watches the dots moving, and eventually makes a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking many of these decisions creates specific patterns of reaction times and errors. For example, the number of errors made has a lawful dependence on the proportion of dots that were moving in the same direction — the fewer the dots, the more errors are made in judging their direction. These patterns of times and errors can be reproduced by a simple model in which the evidence that the dots are moving in each direction (left or right) is added up by two counters that compete: evidence for one direction is also used as evidence against the other direction. And these two competing counters turns out to be formally the same as a decision theory algorithm (the sequential probability ratio test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’ve arrived at an algorithm derived from behaviour: what about the brain’s activity during this behaviour? When we look in the brains of monkeys making these decisions, we see neural activity that increases and decreases over time, some activity representing the correct option, which tends to increase; and some activity representing the incorrect option, which tends to decrease. Just like two competing counters of evidence for two options. And Mike Shadlen’s lab&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4365451/&quot;&gt; have even shown&lt;/a&gt; that each jump in activity reflects the amount of evidence available, exactly like the sequential probability ratio test. Here then we see neural activity that closely approximates an algorithm we arrived at from observing behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(We can even extend the decision algorithm to more than two options, in which case we have the catchily named “multiple sequential probability ratio test”. And this more complex algorithm seems to fit with neural activity in the basal ganglia [read&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; for way more than you wanted to know about this]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have examples of where we started with the neural activity, and worked out what algorithm they seem to represent. These include a (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrainprize.org/flx/prize_winners/previous_prize_winners/prize_winners_2017/&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;) prize-winning triumph of computational neuroscience: the reward prediction error theory of dopamine. The data came first. In a series of papers, Wolfram Schultz had shown how dopamine neurons fired in response to rewards. A few features were particularly intriguing. Dopamine neurons burst excitedly when unexpected rewards were received. They then “learnt” to instead burst in response to something (like a light flash) that predicted a reward was imminent, and no longer burst in response to the reward itself. And once this link between light flash and reward was learnt, the dopamine neurons stopped firing when the reward was predicted but not received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these data, two teams (one with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8774460&quot;&gt;Read Montague and Peter Dayan&lt;/a&gt;, the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243646413_A_Model_of_How_the_Basal_Ganglia_Generate_and_Use_Neural_Signals_that_Predict_Reinforcement&quot;&gt;Jim Houk and Andy Barto&lt;/a&gt;) independently proposed that dopamine neurons are encoding the reward prediction error used in the algorithms of reinforcement learning theory. These algorithms are equipped with a range of options about what to do in the future, and choose an option based on the predicted value of taking each of them. Once an option is chosen, an error is computed between what was predicted and what turned out to be the actual outcome of choosing that option. This error is then used to update the predicted value of the chosen option: if the outcome was as expected, then no error occurred, and nothing needs changing; if the outcome was better than expected — a positive error — the value of the option increases; if the outcome was worse than expected — a negative error — the value of the option decreases. So this “prediction error” creates a way of turning feedback from the world into changes in behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match between the firing of dopamine neurons and this “prediction” error was irresistible. According to Schultz’s data, dopamine neurons signal all three types of error: the absence of error when a reward is predicted, a positive error when a reward is unexpected, and a negative error when expected reward fails to materialise. A seemingly clear match between the discrete step of an algorithm and the activity of some neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Well, not quite. Reinforcement learning theory itself was inspired by decades of research on how animals’ behaviour changes as they learn from reward, and then elaborated into how to best train a computer to learn. So in truth we had behaviour -&amp;gt; computational algorithms -&amp;gt; developed far beyond behavioural observations -&amp;gt; then neural activity found that matches steps in these algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI smelters among you may be wondering: what about success of deep neural networks for doing brain-like computation? Like training neural networks to classify images, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/333452a0&quot;&gt;finding units&lt;/a&gt; that have properties like neurons in visual cortex? Well, AI-style neural networks are discrete time algorithms at heart. And deep neural networks throw another issue into the mix as they have discrete layers, each feeding their output into the next one along. The brain does not have discrete layers. So the success of AI-style neural networks still leaves open the question of whether these operations can be mapped to the continuous dynamics of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, outre, option here is that while the underlying biology of the brain works in continuous time, the effective operations of the brain are divided into discrete steps. One way this might work is through oscillations in neural activity. Brains are beset by oscillations in their activity, alternating between a short period of activity, and a short period of inactivity. If we were feeling generous, and perhaps had a little bit too much of the old vino, we could interpret each short period of activity as dividing continuous time into discrete windows. So each period of activity is one “step”. There is evidence, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30630-5&quot;&gt;of attention oscillating in this way&lt;/a&gt;, our ability to mentally engage periodically switching on and off. But oscillations of brain activity are rarely sustained over long periods, and are never nice clean runs of on then off, and on then off. And these oscillation are slow: many things the brain “computes” happen on much faster time-scales. Still, this idea that actually the brain does have discrete steps deserves holding in mind. And then not in mind. Then in mind again. Then not in mind. You can see where I’m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, the brains does not run algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that seems like a lot of evidence that the brain does indeed run algorithms. And this conclusion is baked into a lot of neuroscience. People routinely write that the brain “computes”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/david-marr-neurosciences-einstein-6e99ba2c616d&quot;&gt;David Marr’s&lt;/a&gt; highly influential ideas for how to go about understanding the brain divide the problem into finding out the algorithm and then finding the hardware, the bit of brain, that runs the algorithm. There are some who wonder how the brain could do anything if it is not running algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a simple answer: we already know lots of things brains do that aren’t algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take running, walking, or the crawling of a baby. Or of a snail. These are all rhythmic movements, the repeated contractions and relaxations of groups of muscles. While Usain Bolt’s muscles may contract and relax faster than yours, the same patterns of neural activity are driving these contractions in you both. These patterns are repeated bursts then silence from a group of connected neurons, each burst signalling the contraction of a particular set of muscles. The repeated patterns of activity are generated within the circuit of neurons, thanks to the way the neurons are wired together. These circuits self-generate dynamics to controls repeated movements: they are not implementing any algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such central pattern generators are found in the brain whenever we find something rhythmic going on in a body (almost: the heart has its own pattern generator). Chewing, for example. Swimming. Flying. Breathing is quite important I hear. All created by circuits of neurons that continuously generate their own activity. No hint of an algorithm, unless “breath in, then breath out” counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singular movements tell us a similar story. An arm reaching for a pint glass or a stick of celery isn’t doing anything rhythmic. But we don’t need to recourse to algorithms to understand where the neural activity is coming from. A set of brief changes in the activity of neurons in the arm part of motor cortex, which talk to neurons in the spine, who contract muscles. What algorithm here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual retort at this point would be: aha! But they’re all movements — surely the richness of memory, of planning, of thought, surely these need something computational, not just “dynamics”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some solutions involving dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for memory. We’ve known how memory could be created by pure “dynamics” for decades: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/wired-for-memory-how-your-brain-remembers-by-completing-patterns-ad2c6d7bff89&quot;&gt;a simple memory can be stored and recalled&lt;/a&gt; simply by a circuit of neurons that fall into a particular pattern of activity given a particular input. Such networks can turn a partial input into a full memory, like how the smell of burnt toast can evoke a rich memory of a slightly disappointing childhood tea-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for doing things with probabilities. Our brains often make use of the probability of something happening, rather than the certainty of it happening. Rewards tend to be uncertain: you may get a promotion if you prove your dedication to the company by signing all reports in your own blood; or you may not. Recent work has shown how a network of neurons that are wired a bit like cortex, and continuously send spikes to each other, can represent probabilities. And, in so doing, can use those probabilities to solve problems. There’s one network that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003311&quot;&gt;solves Sudoku puzzles &lt;/a&gt;(yep, its output needs translating into symbols to do this: but those symbols are ours, not the network’s — it has no idea it’s solving a Sudoku puzzle.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution for doing practically anything with an input. With a name that should really be a manga, Liquid State Machines are a general solution to the problem of “doing stuff with continuous dynamics”. They are a group of randomly-wired together model neurons that continuously send spikes to each other. The important bit is that the network is a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with the latter making their target neurons less likely to fire a spike. Why this is important is that the resulting network is almost guaranteed to have chaotic dynamics. And chaotic dynamics give us a very rich playground in which to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They mean that the transient change in the network’s activity given some input is very different from that given a slightly different input. This big difference is a non-linear response to inputs, yet can easily be read out by a downstream set of neurons. So, in principle, you can achieve any operation on the input you like. The question is: how would a bit of brain end up (through the unholy trinity of evolution, development, and learning) with exactly the right kind of wiring, and the right kind of read out, to get the desired operation on those inputs? Good question, that needs answering. And people are working on answering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no answer, yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many who think the brain is not a computer. Esteemed physicist Roger Penrose dedicated two long books to the idea. Yet he somehow leapt from the premise that “the brain is not a computer” to the existence of quantum consciousness without considering there may be something in between. Like what the brain actually does: produces continuous dynamics that may or may not approximate an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is a computer” is not a metaphor. It is an hypothesis, one that can be defined rigorously enough that we can actually test it. And people can. And are. For hypothesising that a bit of brain runs a certain algorithm makes predictions: predictions about how the activity in that bit of brain will change when the world changes (in ways that are relevant to that algorithm); or predictions about how previously unsuspected bits of brain should be involved in a task if the brain is to compute the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such predictions have been made for the hypothesis that dopamine neuron firing is a “prediction error”. For example, we can make predictions about what the inputs to the dopamine neurons should be. Recall that the dopamine neurons stop firing when there is a negative prediction error, the error when a reward was expected but not delivered, and they stop firing exactly when the expected reward was supposed to turn up. To do this, the dopamine neurons would need to receive an inhibitory signal that stops their activity at exactly the time the reward was expected. A decade of work has shown that the lateral habenula seems to provide exactly this timed inhibitory signal to the dopamine neurons. And this is just one of the many possible predictions that could be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one study will clinch the argument a bit of brain runs algorithm X. Science doesn’t work like that. Support for an hypothesis comes from multiple strands of work, each perhaps weakly supporting the idea, but when weaved together form a giant basket of righteous science (I never claimed to be good at metaphors either). So the answer is not here yet, and any answer will come slowly but inexorably, like a psychopathic slug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I think the brain is a computer? No. I am fully prepared to be totally wrong about that. I have quoted, taught, and even published papers arguing that brains implement algorithms. As I have just shown in all of the above, I can agree with two opposing ideas at the same time. Scientists must often live with such ambiguity: as arguments get polarised into yes/no questions, so it becomes clear that neither position is true.

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after consensual and satisfactory sex, most people report feeling positive, content and psychologically close to their partner. But for some, it has the opposite effect, leaving them tearful and irritable for anything from a few minutes to a few hours. Commonly known as the “post-sex blues”, psychologists call it “post-coital dysphoria” (PCD) and until recently they had only studied it in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2015, Robert D Schweitzer at the Queensland University of Technology led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26797056&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of 230 Australian female students, in which 46 per cent reported experiencing PCD at some point in their lives, and about 2 per cent said they experienced it regularly.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now masters student Joel Maczkowiack and Schweitzer have published – in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy&lt;/i&gt; – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2018.1488326&quot;&gt;first ever study&lt;/a&gt; to show that some men suffer from PCD, too.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34733&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted an anonymous online survey of 1,208 men aged 18 to 81, from 78 different countries. Most were in a relationship that had lasted for at least a year.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-one per cent of these men reported having experienced PCD at some point in their lifetime, and for 20 per cent, it had happened in the four weeks preceding the study. Just over 4 per cent reported experiencing PCD regularly. The descriptions of how PCD feels included, “I don’t want to be touched and I want to be left alone”; “I feel unsatisfied, annoyed and very fidgety”; and being “emotionless and empty”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also assessed current symptoms of depression and anxiety and past sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Current psychological distress was associated with PCD, but it was not a major predictor (which was also the case in the study of women). Childhood sexual abuse was also linked to PCD but, again, as for women, it was a minor factor in explaining the results. For the men, sexual dysfunction was implicated in some cases, but it certainly wasn’t a major risk factor. Exactly what accounts for PCD in many people is not clear. It has been suggested that, for some, at least, the symptoms might be caused by the fall in levels of endorphins and certain hormones that peaked during orgasm.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first study to show that men do experience PCD, this work challenges common assumptions about sex always being pleasurable for men, the researchers say. “Males who experience PCD, and their partners, may find it comforting to know that they are not alone in their experience and that negative postcoital experiences may simply reflect normal variation in [the] human sexual response,” Maczkowiack and Schweitzer write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Is the coding metaphor relevant for the genome?</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have argued that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;the neural coding metaphor is highly misleading&lt;/a&gt; (see also similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/&quot;&gt;arguments by Mark Bickhard&lt;/a&gt; in cognitive science). The coding metaphor is very popular in neuroscience, but there is another domain of science where it is also very popular: genetics. Is there a genetic code? Many scientists have criticized the idea of a genetic code (and of a genetic program). A detailed criticism can be found in Denis Noble’s book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Music-Life-Biology-Beyond-Genes/dp/0199228361&quot;&gt;The music of life&lt;/a&gt;” (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135048&quot;&gt;Noble 2011&lt;/a&gt; for a short review).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the arguments I have made in my essay on neural coding readily apply to the “genetic code”. Let us start with the technical use of the metaphor. The genome is a sequence of DNA base triplets called “codons” (ACG, TGA, etc). Each codon specifies a particular amino-acid, and proteins are made of amino-acids. So there is a correspondence between DNA and amino-acids. This seems an appropriate use of the term “code”. But even it in this limited sense, it should be used with caution. The fact that a base triplet encodes an amino-acid is conditional on this triplet being effectively translated into an amino-acid (note that there are two stages, transcription into RNA, then translation into a protein). But in fact only a small fraction of a genome is actually translated, about 10% (depending on species); the rest is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA&quot;&gt;non-coding DNA&lt;/a&gt;”. So the same triplets can result in the production of an amino-acid, or they can influence the translation-transcription system in various ways, for example by interacting with various molecules involved in the production of RNA and proteins, thereby regulating transcription and translation (and this is just one example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when DNA does encode amino-acids, it does not follow that a gene encodes a protein. What might be said is that a gene encodes the primary structure of proteins, that is, the sequence of amino-acids; but it does not specify by itself the shape that the protein will take (which determines its chemical properties), the various modifications that occur after translation, the position that the protein will take in the cellular system. All of those crucial properties depend on the interaction of the product of transcription with the cellular system. In fact, even the primary structure of proteins is not fully determined by the gene, because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing&quot;&gt;splicing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the genome is not just a book, as suggested by the coding metaphor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5475/2304.long&quot;&gt;some have called the genome the “book of life”&lt;/a&gt;); it is a chemically active substance that interacts with its chemical environment, a part of a larger cellular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the genetic code metaphor, genes encode phenotypes, traits of the organism. For example, the gene for blue eyes. A concept that often appears in the media is the idea of genes responsible for diseases. One hope behind the human genome project was that by scrutinizing the human genome, we might be able to identify the genes responsible for every disease (at least for every genetic disease). Some diseases are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder#Single_gene_disorder&quot;&gt;monogenic&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., due to a single gene defect, but the most common diseases are polygenic, i.e., are due to a combination of genetic factors (and generally environmental factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the idea of monogenic traits is misleading. There is no single gene that encodes a given trait. What has been demonstrated in some cases is that mutations in a single gene can impact a given trait. But this does not mean that the gene is responsible by itself for that trait (surprisingly, this fallacy is quite common in the scientific literature, as pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01677063.2018.1468443&quot;&gt;Yoshihara &amp;amp; Yoshihara 2018&lt;/a&gt;). A gene by itself does nothing. It needs to be embedded into a system, namely a cell, in order to produce any phenotype. Consequently, the expressed phenotype depends on the system in which the gene is embedded, in particular the rest of the genome. There cannot be a gene for blue eyes if there are no eyes. So no gene can encode the color of eyes; this encoding is at best contextual (in the same way as “neural codes” are always contextual, as discussed in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;neural coding essay&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the concept of a “genetic code” can only be correct in a trivial sense: that the genome, as a whole, specifies the organism. This clearly limits the usefulness of the concept, however. Unfortunately, even this trivial claim is also incorrect. An obvious objection is that the genome specifies the organism only in conjunction with the environment. The deeper objection is that the immediate environment of the genome is the cell itself. No entity smaller than the cell can live or reproduce. The genome is not a viable system, and as such it cannot produce an organism, nor can it reproduce. An interesting experiment is the following: the nucleus (and thus the DNA) from an animal cell is transferred to the egg of an animal of another species (where the nucleus has been removed) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/72/3/510/2666963&quot;&gt;Sun et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;). The “genetic code” theory would predict that the egg would develop into an animal of the donor species. What actually happens (this was done in related fish species) is that the egg develops into some kind of hybrid, with the development process closer to that of the recipient species. Thus, even in the most trivial sense, the genome does not encode the organism. Finally, since no entity smaller than the cell can reproduce, it follows that the genome is not the unique basis of heritability – the entire cell is (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148257&quot;&gt;Fields &amp;amp; Levin, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the genome does not encode much except for amino-acids (for about 10% of it). It should be conceptualized as a component that interacts with the cellular system, not as a “book” that would be read by some cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papt.12184&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice &lt;/i&gt;argues that the relationship a person has with their eating disorder is shaped by that person’s understanding of what meaningful relationships should look like – and, in turn, this can have important consequences for the severity of their disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Emma Forsén Mantilla and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden wanted to better understand eating disorders through “attachment theory”. This is the idea that relationships with primary caregivers become scripts that we lean on to tell us how relationships “work”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34774&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent perceived as being protecting will lead a child to feel trust, according to this theory, and to expect a protection-trust dynamic in future relationships. A more troubled caregiver-child relationship, in contrast, leads to a different form of attachment, and downstream consequences – including believing that it’s normal that people who care about you attack you. In addition, attachment tells us how it’s appropriate to treat ourselves – such as by attacking or judging ourselves. Once these dynamics have formed, we gravitate towards them especially when we’re distressed (and being prevented from following these learned dynamics can trigger yet more upset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders are more common in people with less secure attachment styles, and on the surface there are certain parallels in how people experience eating disorders and the attachment dynamics described above – for instance, it is when distressed that people with eating disorders are most likely to seek consolation in comforting, but ultimately counterproductive, eating behaviours, and people with eating disorders can become even more agitated when they are prevented from performing these behaviours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a deeper connection between attachment theory and the experience of eating disorders in what some researchers and service users have previously labelled the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/28/recovering-patients-describe-their-battles-with-an-anorexia-voice/&quot;&gt;anorexic voice&lt;/a&gt;” – when symptoms are maintained through harsh and forceful judgments about oneself and instructions to the self that are attributed to the anorexia condition. Despite its negative, attacking nature, the voice is often still considered an ally rather than an enemy, again resembling certain insecurely attached relationships. So it seems a plausible to see eating disorders in these terms, especially as attachment patterns can be established in how people relate to non-humans – pets and even God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantilla’s team tried to establish a coherent pathway between eating disorder clients’ attachment styles and their symptoms. They ran a correlational study involving 148 women with eating disorders aged 16-25 recruited from outpatient units in Sweden. The researchers measured eating disorder behaviours with questions like “over the past 28 days, on how many days have you made yourself sick (vomit) as a means of controlling your shape or weight?”and found, consistent with previous findings, that these behaviours were more pronounced in people with a less secure attachment style (assessed with questions like “I feel confident about relating to others.”). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantilla also asked participants to complete a survey normally used to look at specific attachment dynamics with a significant other, but in this case rephrased to focus on the eating disorder – e.g. “It punishes and tortures me, takes revenge” – as well as whether they turned these patterns inward.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers predicted, less securely attached individuals in general tended to see their eating disorders as more controlling, and themselves as less autonomous. These individuals were also more likely to treat themselves in a blaming way, and this self-blaming and the sense of a controlling quality to their eating disorder entirely explained the association between overall attachment and their eating disorder symptoms and behaviours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a plausible story can be made from the data that insecure attachment produces a tendency to internalise blame and an expectation of a controlling relationship that then takes shape in an eating disorder, producing eating disordered symptoms accordingly. In a correlational design, of course, this is not proof but has a sense of plausibility to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In helping people to work past eating disorders, psychologists using narrative therapy already characterise the disorder as an external entity in a relationship. This research may be useful in honing in on the aspects of this relationship most strongly associated with actual eating disorder behaviours – the controlling nature of the disorder and how it may prop up and reinforce self-blame. It also suggests the likely obstacles faced by these clients in forming other relationships, which may prevent them developing emotional support and regulation that in itself can prevent relapse. And the results shed light on why people can be appear to be so wholly in the grasp of an eating disorder – because losing it can almost feel like losing someone who “gets” you. Anorexia and similar conditions can be like a tight embrace that goes both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how important maths skills are in everyday life, it is vital that we develop ways to reliably identify those children with particular learning difficulties related to maths (known as “specific learning disorder in mathematics”/SLDM or dyscalculia) so that they can be provided with appropriate support. Unfortunately, maths-related learning problems are far less understood and recognised compared with similar problems related to reading and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12322&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; highlights this issue, being the first to estimate the prevalence of SLDM/dyscalculia in primary school age children using contemporary criteria (as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association in the latest version of its diagnostic manual). The results provide much needed data on this topic, reveal some worrying facts and also useful insights for policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34762&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is based on nearly 2,500 children, aged 7 to 13, from 19 rural and urban schools in Northern Ireland. The data are averages of several years’ standardised test results of the children’s maths, reading and IQ, together with background demographic information and notes on any diagnoses of other developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, diagnosis of SLDM/dyscalculia took a child’s IQ into account a child, such that a specific problem with maths was only diagnosed if their maths ability was low relative to their IQ – the so-called “discrepancy criterion”. The newer diagnostic criteria (in DSM 5) abandon this principle. Now a persistent, significant problem with maths counts as SLDM/dyscalculia even if it occurs alongside comparably low IQ or other learning problems (however SLDM is still discounted in the context of extremely low IQ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the new criteria, Kinga Morsanyi and her colleagues at Queen’s University Belfast, estimated the relevance of SLDM/dyscalculia in primary school children at around 6 per cent. This is substantially higher than previous estimates of 1.1 per cent prevalence based on the earlier diagnostic criteria. Morsanyi’s team said this could have “huge consequences for children’s outcomes” because it means more children ought to be able to access maths-based educational support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat worryingly, however, the data showed that only one child in the sample had actually received a formal diagnosis of SLDM/dyscalculia, in contrast with 108 children who had received a diagnosis of dyslexia. Given that prevalence rates of SLDM/dyscalculia and dyslexia are usually similar, the researchers explained that this means “we can say that a child with dyslexia was more than a hundred times more likely to receive an official diagnosis of that disorder (which is necessary to obtain specialist educational support) than a child with dyscalculia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the revamped diagnostic criteria ought to lead to the identification of more children with SLDM/dyscalculia, thus opening up the chance for them to receive specialist support, but in practice this does not seem to be happening. At least, not yet. Moreover, from speaking to educational psychologists, Morsanyi and her team said the situation is compounded by the fact the educational psychologists said there are “no generally accepted intervention methods that could be recommended” for SLDM (a further complication is that the new diagnostic criteria state that maths problems should be persistent in spite of interventions, which promotes the unhelpful idea that extra support for children with SLDM/dyscalculia is futile – the researchers challenge this view and point to their finding of reduced prevalence of SLDM/dyscalculia with age as evidence that persistent maths problems can be addressed effectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An important first step,” to addressing these issues, they said, “would be to raise awareness of SLDM/dyscalculia among both teachers and educational psychologists as part of their work training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of demographic background and other concurrent diagnoses, the new data suggest that children with persistent maths problems also often have problems with English and low IQ; tend to come from relatively deprived backgrounds; usually have other special educational needs; and are more likely to have “newcomer status” (meaning that English wasn’t their first language). The researchers said that additional support for maths should be given to children with SLDM/dyscalculia regardless of the source of their maths problems (be they environmental or cognitive or a mix of the two). They also noted that there were some children with SLDM/dyscalculia who also had a diagnosis of autism, but none with a concurrent diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final finding to note concerns gender differences – overall, there was no evidence that girls or boys were more likely to have dyscalculia/SLDM (or be exceptional in maths), which contrasts with the situation for dyslexia, which is about twice as common among boys. However, when the researchers matched girls and boys for IQ and English scores (which were generally higher in girls overall) and special educational needs status, there was evidence of more maths problems among girls than similar status boys – what the researchers described as “… a hidden gender difference in maths performance even among primary school children. That is, although girls do not underperform in terms of their actual scores, they underperform relative to their cognitive/learning potential”. Considering reports that many girls lose interest in maths and science at around age 11, the researchers said another policy implication of their results was that intervention programmes aimed at encouraging girls into science and maths subjects should start even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prepared media statement, Morsanyi wrote that “From these figures, we can estimate that about 10,000 children in Northern Ireland have sustained, serious difficulties with mathematics. Given that virtually no children in our sample received an official diagnosis of mathematics disorder, we can expect that most of these children do not receive educational support with mathematics. This can have very important adverse consequences.” She added that “…these figures in the UK in general would be much higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
