&lt;p&gt;How do we acquire our native language? Are the basics of language and grammar innate, as nativists argue? Or, as empiricists propose, is language something we must learn entirely from scratch?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This debate has a long history. To get at an answer, it’s worth setting the theories aside and instead looking at just how much information &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;be learned in order to speak a language with adult proficiency, argue Francis Mollica at the University of Rochester, US, and Steven Piantadosi at the University of California, Berkeley. If the amount is vast, for instance, this could indicate that it’s impracticable for it all to be learned without sophisticated innate language mechanisms. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181393&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/i&gt;, Mollica and Piantadosi present results suggesting that some language-specific knowledge could be innate – but probably not the kind of syntactic knowledge (the grammatical rules underlying correct word order) that nativists have tended to argue in favour of. Indeed, their work suggests that the long-running focus on whether syntax is learned or innate has been misplaced.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36978&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollica and Piantadosi worked out “back-of-the-envelope” upper, lower and “best guess” estimates of how much information we have to absorb in order to acquire various aspects of language — to identify phonemes (units of sound), word-forms, and lexical semantics (the meaning of words and the relationships between them), as well as syntax, for example.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maths that they used to do this is complex. (If you’re fond of equations that span a page-width, you should definitely check theirs out.) But their fundamental approach is to compute the number of “bits” required to specify an outcome&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;— learning the meaning of a word, for example — “from a plausible space of logically possible alternatives”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, they estimate that storing essential knowledge about phonemes takes up only about 750 bits (a bit is a binary unit of information used in computing; 8 million bits is equivalent to 1 megabyte). However, a typical adult vocabulary of about 40,000 words involves perhaps about 400,000 bits of lexical knowledge. Storing information about what all these words mean is more demanding: the researchers’ best guess is somewhere in the region of 12,000,000 bits. A language-learner would also need to store about 80,000 bits of information about word frequency, they suggest.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Mollica and Piantadosi turned to syntax. “Syntax has traditionally been the battleground for debates about how much information is built-in versus learned,” they write. “In the face of massively incompatible and experimentally under-determined syntactic theories, we aim here to study the question in a way that is as independent as possible.” In fact, they estimate that we need to store only a very small amount of data about syntax — perhaps only 667 bits. According to these estimates, having innate knowledge of syntax wouldn’t be especially helpful, as acquiring it is relatively undemanding.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntactic knowledge may not require a huge amount of knowledge but the total amount of language-related information that must be stored by a proficient language speaker is massive: around 1.5 megabytes. If correct, this would mean that up until the age of 18, a child would have to remember, on average, 1000 to 2000 bits of information every day. The researchers’ very lowest estimate is that reaching adult language proficiency would require that a child learn 120 bits per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To put our lower estimate in perspective, each day for 18 years a child must wake up and remember, perfectly and for the rest of their life, an amount of information equivalent to the information in this sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;011010000110100101100100011001000110010101101110011000010110001101100011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;011011110111001001100100011010010110111101101110”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a “remarkable feat of cognition” suggests that language acquisition is grounded in “remarkably sophisticated mechanisms for learning, memory and inference,” the pair comment.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ballpark-type figures, they stress. But, even so, they argue that their estimates suggest that neither the nativist nor the empiricist approach provides a viable account of how we come to represent lexical semantics (word meanings) – which their work indicates is overwhelmingly the biggest language mountain to conquer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that if any language-specific knowledge is innate, it is most likely for helping tackle the immense challenge of learning lexical semantics, rather than other domains with learnability problems that require orders of magnitude less information,” Mollica and Piantadosi&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181393&quot;&gt;Humans store about 1.5 megabytes of information during language acquisition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Consumers assume that when they take an over-the-counter pain medication, it will relieve their physical symptoms, but they do not anticipate broader psychological effects.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latest installment of this alarmist saga, we learn that acetaminophen blunts positive empathy, i.e. the capacity to appreciate and identify with the positive emotions of others (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00538/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mischkowski et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). I'll discuss those findings another time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, let's evaluate the entire TYLENOL® oeuvre by taking a step back and examining the plausibility of the published claims. To summarize, one of the most common over-the-counter, non-narcotic, non-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug&quot;&gt;NSAID&lt;/a&gt; pain-relieving medications in existence supposedly alleviates the personal experience of hurt feelings and social pain and heartache (positive outcomes). At the same time, TYLENOL® blunts the phenomenological experiences of positive emotion and diminishes empathy for others' people's experiences, both good and bad (negative outcomes). Published articles have reported that many of these effects can be observed after ONE REGULAR DOSE of paracetamol. These findings are based on how undergraduates judge a series of hypothetical stories. One major problem (which is not specific to The Paracetamol Papers) concerns the ecological validity of laboratory tasks as measures of the cognitive and emotional constructs of interest. This issue is critical, but outside the main scope of our discussion today. More to the point, an experimental manipulation may cause a statistically significant shift in a variable of interest, but ultimately we have to decide whether a circumscribed finding in the lab has broader implications for society at large. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why TYLENOL® ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another puzzling element is, why choose acetaminophen as the exclusive pain medication of interest? Its mechanisms of action for relieving fever, headache, and other pains are unclear. Thus, the authors don't have a specific, principled reason for choosing TYLENOL® over Advil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;) or aspirin. Presumably, the effects should generalize, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For instance, ibuprofen actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/06/advil-increases-social-pain-if-youre.html&quot;&gt;Increases Social Pain&lt;/a&gt; in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analgesic effects of acetaminophen are mediated by a complex series of cellular mechanisms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). One proposed mechanism involves descending serotonergic bulbospinal pathways from the brainstem to the spinal cord. This isn't exactly Prozac territory, so the analogy between Tylenol and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SSRI antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; isn't apt. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the Cav3.2 calcium channel might also be part of the action (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). A recently recognized player is the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabinoid receptor&lt;/a&gt;. AM404, a metabolite of acetaminophen, indirectly activates CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting the breakdown and reuptake of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an endocannabinoid&quot;&gt; anandamide&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the brain  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s1600/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;281&quot; data-original-width=&quot;387&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s400/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cannabinoids, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the non-intoxicating cousin of THC &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; has a high profile now because of its soaring popularity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many ailments&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, CBD has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cbdv.200790147&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very low affinity&lt;/a&gt; for  CB&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;and&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;CB&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;receptors and may act instead via  &lt;span class=&quot;highlight selected&quot;&gt;sero&lt;/span&gt;tonergic 5-HT1A receptors {&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/41359764/Cannabidiol__Recent_Advances20160120-1921-1rxjn6j.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;amp;Expires=1556433869&amp;amp;Signature=fjs1C9zN1XpIOTs5FCsR8WmBrrY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCannabidiol_Recent_Advances.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;}, as a modulator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Μ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;μ-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Δ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;δ-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, and as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antagonist and inverse agonist&lt;/a&gt; at several G protein-coupled receptors. Most CBD use seems to be in the non-therapeutic (placebo) range, because the effective dose for, let's say, anxiety is 10-20 times higher than the average commercial product. You'd have to eat 3-6 bags of cranberry gummies for 285-570 mg of CBD (close to the 300-600 mg recommended dose). Unfortunately, you would also ingest 15-30 mg of THC, which would be quite intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&quot;the typical cup of CBD-infused coffee that you buy in your local trendy coffee shop will have, on average, 5-10 mg of CBD, which is nowhere near the therapeutic dosage [at least 300 mg] required for it to have any kind of anxiolytic effect&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1121740961774571521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Words Have Meanings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If acetaminophen were so effective in “mending broken hearts”, “easing heartaches”, and providing a “cure for a broken heart”, we would be a society of perpetually happy automatons, wiping away the suffering of breakup and divorce with a mere OTC tablet. We'd have Tylenol epidemics and Advil epidemics to rival the scourge of the present Opioid Epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, social and political discourse in the US has reached a new low. Ironically, the paracetamol “blissed-out” population is enraged because they can't identify with the feelings or opinions of the masses who are 'different' than they are. Somehow, I don't think it's from taking too much Tylenol. A large-scale global survey could put that thought to rest for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;525&quot; data-original-width=&quot;663&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s400/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/26/nope-its-not-just-you-world-around-you-really-is-getting-angrier/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nope, it’s not just you: The world around you really is getting angrier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is not true, of course, I was only kidding.

&lt;p&gt;To win a medal of any kind at the Olympic Games takes years of training, hard work and sacrifice. Standing on an Olympic podium is widely regarded as the pinnacle of an athlete’s career. Nonetheless, only one athlete can win gold, leaving the two runner-up medallists to ponder what might have been. Intriguingly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7473022&quot;&gt;seminal study&lt;/a&gt; from the 1992 Olympic Games suggested that this counterfactual thinking was especially painful for silver medallists, who appeared visibly less happy than bronze medallists. The researchers speculated that this may have been because of the different counterfactual thinking they engaged in, with bronze medallists being happy that they didn’t come fourth while silver medallists felt sad that they didn’t win gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, subsequent research based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103104001118&quot;&gt;the 2000 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; did not replicate this finding: this time silver medallists were found to be happier than bronze medallists. To further muddy the waters, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16938038&quot;&gt;a study from the 2004 Games&lt;/a&gt; was consistent with the seminal research, finding that straight after competition, gold and bronze medallists were more likely to smile than silver medallists, with these smiles being larger and more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now further insight into the psychology of coming second or third comes via Mark Allen, Sarah Knipler and Amy Chan of the University of Wollongong, who have released &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeamerica.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2019.1592803?journalCode=rjsp20#.XKH5L1VKia4&quot;&gt;their findings based on the 2016 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. These latest results, published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sports Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, again challenge that initial eye-grabbing result that suggested bronze medallists are happier than silver medallists, but they support the idea that the nature of counterfactual thinking differs depending on whether athletes come second or third.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36970&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the researchers had 20 participants rate how happy 486 Olympic medallists looked whilst standing on the podium.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The participants based their judgments on full headshot photos of each athlete, deliberately cropped so that they could not see which medal the athletes had won. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated gold medal athletes as being significantly happier than those who won either silver or bronze. They rated bronze medallists as marginally happier than silver medallists, though by such a small margin that it is “likely to be trivial or negligible”, according to Allen and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their second study, the researchers explored how much counterfactual thinking the different athletes did by having participants analyse the media interviews of 192 silver and bronze medallists.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They explored frequency (i.e. how much they dwelt on “what if…” scenarios), direction (i.e. what things could have gone better vs. what things could have been worse) and reference (i.e. reflecting on what they could have done differently vs. what their opponent could have done differently).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that silver medallists engaged more frequently in counterfactual thinking than bronze medallists, and that this was likely to be directed towards how the event could have gone better.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Interestingly, both silver and bronze medallists primarily focused on their own performance, but silver medallists more often than bronze medallists also spent time talking about how their opponents had performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides updated evidence that suggests that gold medallists are happiest on the podium and that no meaningful difference exists in happiness levels between silver and bronze medallists. However, the thought process and reflections between second and third-placed athletes do seem to vary, with silver medallists being more preoccupied by thoughts of how things could have been better and what would have happened if their opponents had behaved differently. These thought processes may act as a defence mechanism in order to protect their self-esteem and self-image. By reflecting on external factors, such as their opponent’s behaviour, it provides a shield to hide behind and deflect personal criticism away from any shortcomings of their own individual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study builds on previous research by using a larger sample size, blinding the participants to the outcome of the athletes’ medals, and by using equivalence tests to supplement standard statistical methods (such tests help identify whether a statistically significant finding is actually meaningful). That being said, the researchers note several important limitations, such as that some athletes were so well known that the participants probably knew what medal they had earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other limitations include only using static photos of the athletes posing for the media on top of the podium. If that was to be broadened out to include either video footage or full body shots, this may be beneficial as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23197536&quot;&gt;evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; that body language may be a better indicator of emotions than facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research makes a valuable contribution given the mixed findings previously reported. Furthermore, it may inform sports psychologists and coaches who work with athletes that have finished second or third in major competitions, helping them to provide appropriately tailored support.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Are mental health nurses ready for the challenge of physical healthcare?</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/26/mental-health-nurses-ready-challenge-physical-healthcare/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/Nursing-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the problem? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are increasingly aware of what it means to face a mental health crisis, or to live with an ongoing mental health problem. However, it is less widely known that rates of physical illness among people with long-term mental health conditions are among the highest of any group in society. It may shock you to learn that according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/guidelines_physical_health_and_severe_mental_disorders/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; figures, the lifespan of a person with severe mental health problems is as much as 20 years shorter than that of someone without. This morbidity can mostly be accounted for by physical health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that these conditions are influenced by modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, substance misuse, and obesity, and that some of these factors are far more common among people with mental health conditions. For example, people with schizophrenia are between 3 and 4 times more likely to be heavy smokers than people who are not affected by such disorders. Inequalities of outcome, like shorter lives and frequent ill-health, are unlikely to change without effective lifestyle interventions, but these interventions are rarely considered across mental healthcare settings as part of an individual’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are mental health nurses doing about this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health nurses often have a trusted role, developed from building long-term therapeutic relationships with their patients. They can make significant contributions to reductions in physical ill-health burdens for those with severe mental health problems by addressing several common lifestyle risk factors. However, nurses working in the specialty have traditionally focused only on mental health issues, and may have lacked the knowledge and skills necessary to make an impact on physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know if mental health nurses across the globe are ready for the challenge of improving their physical healthcare skills. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-019-0339-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conducted a systematic search&lt;/a&gt; for published studies discussing mental health nurses’ attitudes and knowledge of routine physical healthcare interventions that can contribute significantly to improving the health of people suffering from mental health conditions. We wanted to determine what nurses know about these issues and their attitude towards them. Specifically, we investigated whether nurses saw physical healthcare as a key part of their role. We also aimed to determine if they felt they had the knowledge and skills to provide routine physical healthcare, and to identify which methods of training show the greatest improvement in the provision of physical healthcare. We rated the quality of each study to ensure the strongest research was given the most consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we need to determine the most effective ways of training mental health nurses to deliver physical healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fast-growing area of research interest: we found that more than 40 studies have been carried out over the last 25 years, with 31 of these published since the year 2010. The studies we reviewed included over 7,500 mental health nurses internationally. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest accumulation of research about mental health nurses’ experiences of any single subject ever published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that mental health nurses were generally positive about their need to be involved in meeting the physical health needs of the service users they worked with. They saw it as a central part of their role, but some lacked confidence and specific skills. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those with more positive attitudes were inclined to deliver more physical healthcare. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of training mental health nurses to deliver effective physical healthcare interventions lack rigor, and more work is needed on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, of all the studies we investigated, UK-based nurses were most positive in their attitudes – more so than those in Australia and some Asian countries. &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This may be considered surprising as mental health nurse training in the UK is considered more specialized than in many other countries, with more time spent focusing on mental health than physical health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are good news insofar as nurses in this specialist field recognize and value the role they can and should play in improving health outcomes for this marginalized population group. However, there is still work to be done to improve their knowledge, confidence and skills. There is much less research about how we can do this successfully. Going forward, we need to determine the most effective ways of training mental health nurses to deliver physical healthcare. Further, specialist pre-registration in mental health, like that observed in the UK, does not seem to disadvantage nurses in terms of their self-rated physical healthcare skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be the benefit for patients?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health nurses require more skills in the delivery of interventions to address lifestyle issues. If they felt better prepared to deliver smoking cessation, alcohol-related advice, weight management, and sexual healthcare, then, over time, we confidently predict improvement in the current statistics of poor physical health of people with mental health problems. Ultimately, along with other advances in care, we would expect to see people with long-term mental health problems living progressively longer and healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can have £10 today or £12 next week. Which do you go for?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to forego a reward now in favour of gaining something better later is known to be important in determining all kinds of desirable outcomes in life, including greater educational attainment, social functioning and health.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, choosing to delay gratification won’t &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be the best option. If you’re in desperate circumstances – you badly need money to buy food, for example – taking the £10 today could be sensible. But this isn’t necessarily an entirely conscious judgment – there may be biological systems that automatically shift your decision-making priorities according to what is most likely to enhance your survival. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41437-1.epdf&quot;&gt;new open-access study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt; provides evidence that having raised levels of inflammation in your body, which is generally caused by the immune system’s response to infection or injury, can skew your judgment to focus more on present rewards, and on instant gratification. If further research backs this up, there could be wide-ranging implications not only for understanding why some people are more impulsive than others, but even for treating substance abuse.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36967&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Gassen and colleagues at the Texas Christian University, US, reasoned that inflammation should enhance a person’s desire for immediately available resources, as the body’s response to sickness requires extra energy, and, for a sick person, their future is less certain. To explore whether this is actually the case, they recruited 159 healthy, non-obese, young college students who abstained from behaviours that can cause an acute increase in inflammation, such as smoking, exercise, sex and drinking alcohol, for two days prior to the study.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants completed a widely-used impulsiveness scale, an instant gratification inventory, as well as two behavioural assessments – one of which explored their preferences for smaller and immediate vs. larger, delayed rewards. The participants also reported their body mass index, physical activity levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, stress and other variables (all of which relate to having a greater focus on the present, to inflammation levels, or both).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants then gave blood samples, which were checked for levels of three pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins that indicate greater inflammation). The researchers found that participants with higher levels of inflammation also tended to have a style of decision-making characterised by impulsivity, a focus on the present, and an inability to delay gratification.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis alone of course cannot indicate the direction of the relationship. Might it rather be the case that harmful, present-focused behaviours were driving higher levels of inflammation? The researchers explored this possibility by looking to see whether particular behaviours – usual levels of smoking, alcohol intake and risky sexual behaviours, for instance – predicted greater inflammation. But none did.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound surprising (as smoking, for example, has been clearly associated with inflammation in past studies). But these participants were chosen on purpose to be healthy and young. They were also instructed to avoid such behaviours for 48 hours prior to the study, in theory to make it easier to isolate any effects of inflammation on decision-making.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, “these results suggest that the activities of the immune system may play an important role in shaping decision-making preferences,” Gassen and his colleagues write. In doing so, they add “…to the growing body of research demonstrating that the internal, physiological condition of the body plays an important role in modulating decision-making and behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If further experimental work can firm up this link, there could be “exciting new possibilities” for treating substance abuse disorders, the researchers suggest, and there could be implications for people who have experienced early life stress, who are known to be more prone to inflammation. Drug-based or behavioural interventions targeted at reducing circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines might possibly “sever the link between an individual’s propensity to inflammation and undesirable behaviours, improving outcomes for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers themselves point out, clearly a lot more work has to be done. But as they also note, this study was on healthy young people, with relatively low levels of inflammation. People with chronic illness or obesity have persistently high levels and the activity of their immune system may then have an even greater effect on the way that they behave and even think.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41437-1.epdf&quot;&gt;Inflammation Predicts Decision-Making Characterized by Impulsivity, Present Focus, and an Inability to Delay Gratification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Prevalence of post-treatment Lyme disease in the United States — what can we expect?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/tick-2371827_640-620x342-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidence of Lyme disease, caused by tick-borne &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, has now reached epidemic proportions in the US. There are an estimated 400,000 cases per year, with numbers rising due to climate change and habitat expansion of the tick vector. Early symptoms include skin rash, fever, and joint pain. With timely diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most patients recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, treatment fails in at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430045/&quot;&gt;10-20% of patients&lt;/a&gt;, who develop persistent symptoms including chronic pain, cognitive dysfunction, and debilitating fatigue. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). These symptoms are often severe, frequently leading to profound personal, educational, and monetary losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, estimates of the number of people in the US living with PTLD were not available. This manuscript provides the framework for a mathematical modeling technique that can be used to estimate the prevalence of PTLD in the US. We apply our technique to three incidence scenarios and two failure rates to estimate the cumulative prevalence of PTLD in the years 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US. The 95% confidence intervals suggest that incident rates could even reach as high as 2.3 million cases. All results indicate the prevalence of PTLD is rising over time. The approach we present provides a framework for updating prevalence estimates in future years and when more precise input data become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our PTLD estimates are calculated using mathematical modeling and simulation, counting survivors of cases originating from 1980 until two index dates, 2016 and 2020. This framework incorporates multiple data types from several sources. We first propose three possible trajectories for the annual incidence of Lyme disease, and model the growth of the epidemic during the years the disease has been documented in the US. These trajectories were based on previously published information about Lyme disease incidence rates, originating from two sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source was based on public health surveillance, when medical clinicians report Lyme disease cases to local and state health authorities. This method estimated 34,449 cases per year by 2005. The second source was obtained by US CDC epidemiologists and was based on studies of either Lyme disease testing lab results or health insurance claims. These sources calculated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26291194&quot;&gt;more than 300,000 incident cases per year&lt;/a&gt; by 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disparity between these two numbers indicates vast under-reporting by health authorities, is consistent with community-based reports that suggest large numbers of cases, and exemplifies shortfalls in the current Lyme disease knowledge base. It is possible that actual incidence rates are much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these two figures of annual incidence, we modeled three scenarios of growth of the Lyme disease epidemic: linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 34,449 by 2005, then remaining stable at 34,449 thereafter (Scenario A in Figure 1); linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005, then remaining stable at 329,000 thereafter (Scenario B); or linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005 and continued linear growth onward (Scenario C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10992&quot; style=&quot;width: 470px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10992&quot; height=&quot;502&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/Estimates-of-prevalence-of-PTLD-in-US-in-2020.png&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: Estimates of Prevalence of PTLD in the US in 2020. Circles represent the mean under three Lyme incidence patterns (see text) and failure rates of 10 and 20%. The vertical bars represent 95% coverage intervals about the means.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second important input measure in calculating cumulative PTLD cases was a treatment failure rate, which has been estimated at up to 40% of cases in some studies. We chose to more narrowly define this as either 10% or 20%. These two failure rates, combined with three incidence scenarios, resulted in six mathematical simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All simulations accounted for age and gender distributions of Lyme disease diagnosis, as well as life expectancy. For example, if a five-year-old girl diagnosed in 1983 with Lyme disease was among the 10-20% with PTLD, she might still be alive and counted in 2020. However, a 55-year old man diagnosed at the same time might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prevalence estimates reveal there are likely millions of people struggling with chronic illness and disability due to the effects of Lyme disease. In addition, they and their families are impacted financially, because they are often unable to work or complete educations, and are forced to bear the medical costs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating acute Lyme disease alone has been estimated to cost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2015/lyme-disease-costs-more-than-one-billion-dollars-per-year-to-treat-study-finds.html&quot;&gt;over $1 billion per year&lt;/a&gt; in the US. The costs of treating this chronic disease have not been determined, but are expected to be high. Our study is a first step toward more understanding of the burden of PTLD, and reinforces the need for greatly expanding research that will lead to better treatment of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Why do women still resort to informal sector abortions in countries where abortion is legal?</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/25/why-do-women-still-resort-to-informal-sector-abortions-in-countries-where-abortion-is-legal/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the problem with informal sector abortions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite abortion being legal in many countries, women in both high- and low-income countries commonly seek to terminate unwanted pregnancies outside of the formal healthcare system. Informal sector abortions (ISAs) are not inherently unsafe, particularly when performed by a skilled healthcare provider using safe drugs. However, when clinical guidelines are not followed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521693414001059&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the procedure carries a high risk of complications&lt;/a&gt; such as hemorrhage, renal failure, infertility, trauma to internal organs, and, in some cases, death. As a result, ISAs are an important contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality and morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0751-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt;, we looked at all the qualitative evidence published in English and French on the reasons why women may decide to seek ISAs where abortion is legal, in both high- and low-income settings. We found a total of 16 studies carried out between 1998 and 2018 in ten countries, including five in Sub-Saharan Africa along with Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Cambodia, and the United States. Thirteen of the studies recruited women who had undergone or attempted to undergo an ISA, while the others were based on the analysis of secondary data on the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we learn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies we surveyed confirmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/fulltext&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quantitative evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the practice of ISA is a widespread phenomenon. The medical risks associated with ISA were well known to the women involved, but fears over medical safety were outweighed by the reservations they had about abortions in formal health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten key reasons were identified for opting for informal sector abortion, ranging from privacy and attitude of healthcare staff, costs involved with formal abortions and timeliness of the procedure. Concerns over &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt; in legal health facilities were listed as a key reason in thirteen of the studies. &lt;em&gt;Costs&lt;/em&gt; associated with legal abortion services was an issue that came up in ten of the studies included. A &lt;em&gt;lack of knowledge of abortion laws&lt;/em&gt; was frequently mentioned too, together with a widespread perception that abortion is not legal, even when it really is. Pregnant women’s &lt;em&gt;fears of mistreatment by staff&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;staff unwillingness to provide abortion or to make a referral&lt;/em&gt; were mentioned as deterrents to seeking a legal abortion in some of the studies. A preference for &lt;em&gt;self-managed abortions at home&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;timeliness&lt;/em&gt; of service were also cited in a few of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10982&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10982 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;155&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-300x155.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Chemlal and Russo, 2019&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key finding of this study is the existence of two pathways to seeking an informal sector abortion. In the first category, women first sought a legal abortion at a formal health facility and only turned to the informal sector when they were unable to proceed through the legal route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trajectory involved women who directly sought an informal sector abortion for the above reasons, without first trying to obtain a legal service; for women in this pathway, ISA was regarded as the normal trajectory for seeking abortion. Formal sector abortion was the last resort after multiple, ineffective clandestine abortion attempts or for treatment after post-abortion complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the study participants, unsafe abortion was not spoken of solely in terms of medical and physical safety, but also in terms of social and economic security. Abortion facilities that did not protect women’s anonymity were deemed to be unsafe. This was mainly due to the fact that societal attitudes to abortion were largely negative and that severe repercussions, such as loss of livelihood and being shunned by their community, hold back women from openly seeking termination of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventing unsafe abortions requires a comprehensive understanding of all the drivers behind each stage of the decision-making process. These include the reasons for unwanted pregnancy, the initial decision to seek an abortion, the choice of provider and method, as well as post-abortion care seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is potential to address informal sector abortions through education and information campaigns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a tendency for studies to focus almost exclusively on countries where abortion is prohibited, neglecting the issue of ISAs in countries where abortion is legal. Our review addresses this gap and identifies a number of issues with formal service providers that in some cases push women to obtain abortions through the informal sector, while highlighting that too little is known about this topic in North Africa, the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we do with this information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of areas for potential intervention have also been highlighted. For example, the influence of women’s social networks in shaping their abortion trajectories was an important point discussed in this review – this means there is potential to address ISAs through education and information campaigns in those communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of medical abortion pills for self-induction, as a harm reduction program, is another area of interest. When women are provided with information on recommended dosages and administration of the drug, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23228504&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;evidence shows that self-induction using misoprostol can be safe&lt;/a&gt;. Women’s preference for self-managed abortions for early stage pregnancies also lends credibility to recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20067668&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies on women’s views on the acceptability of home managed abortions&lt;/a&gt;; governments should recognize this is rapidly becoming an option for unwanted pregnancies, and avoid driving the practice underground, where it can truly become dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the powerful effect that music can have on mood. You might be feeling rather chirpy, but then a tear-jerker comes on the car radio and you arrive home feeling morose (conversely, of course, happy tunes can lift our spirits). For most of us, these effects are not a big deal. But what if you are living with depression? Now the implications become more serious. And, according to a provocative &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published a few years ago, far from seeking out uplifting music, people diagnosed with depression are notably more inclined than healthy controls to choose to listen to sad music (and look at sad images). The controversial implication is that depressed people deliberately act in ways that are likely to maintain their low mood. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; has replicated this finding, but the researchers also present evidence suggesting depressed people are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; seeking to maintain their negative feelings, but rather that they find sad music calming and even uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current study is the most definitive to date in probing depression-related preferences for sad music using different tasks, and the reasons for these preferences,” write the team at the University of South Florida, led by Sunkyung Yoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36960&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research involved 38 female undergrads diagnosed with depression and 38 non-depressed female undergrad controls. The first part of the study was a replication attempt using the same materials as the 2015 paper that found depressed people preferred sad music. The participants listened to 30-second excerpts of sad (“Adagio for Strings” by Samuel Barber” and “Rakavot” by Avi Balili), happy and neutral music, and stated which they would prefer to listen to again in the future. Successfully replicating the earlier research, Yoon and his team found that their depressed participants were more likely to choose the sad music clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, unlike in that earlier research, Yoon’s team also asked their participants why they made the choices they did. The majority of the participants with depression who favoured sad music said that they did so because it was relaxing, calming or soothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the study used new music samples: 84 pairs of 10-second clips of instrumental film music, contrasting happy, sad, fear-inducing, neutral, and also high and low energy tracks. In each case the same participants as before indicated which music they’d prefer to listen to again later. They also heard all the samples again at the end and stated what effect they had on their emotions. The researchers found again that people with depression had a far greater preference than controls for sad, low-energy music (but not fear-inducing music). Critically, though, when they heard these clips again, they reported that they made them feel more happiness and less sadness, contradicting the provocative idea that depressed people are seeking to perpetuate their low mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is unable to speak to why depressed people find low-energy, sad music uplifting, although common sense suggests that if you are feeling down, then a fast-paced, happy clappy tune might be irritating and inappropriate, whereas a more soothing, serious tune could be comforting. Further clues come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/&quot;&gt;another recent study&lt;/a&gt; that investigated why (non-depressed) people generally like listening to sad music when they’re feeling down – for instance, some participants said the sad music acted like a supportive friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research involved only a small sample of female undergrads, and it only looked at emotional effects over a short time frame. Yoon and his colleagues acknowledge more research is needed to find out why exactly depressed people favour sad music. For now though, the new findings suggest that this preference  “… may reflect a desire for calming emotional experience rather than a desire to augment sad feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001&quot;&gt;Why Do Depressed People Prefer Sad Music?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, there is an ongoing debate about the existence of differences between women’s and men’s brains, and the extent to which these might be linked to biological or to cultural factors. In this debate, a real game-changer of a study would involve the identification of clear-cut sex differences in foetal brains: that is, in brains that have not yet been exposed to all the different expectations and experiences that the world might offer. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929318301245&quot;&gt;recent open-access study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; by Muriah Wheelock at the University of Washington and her colleagues, including senior researcher Moriah Thomason at New York University School of Medicine, claims to have done just that, hailed by the researchers themselves as “confirmation that sexual dimorphism in functional brain systems emerges during human gestation” and in various ways by the popular press as, for example, &lt;i&gt;The Times of London’s&lt;/i&gt; headline: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/proof-at-last-women-and-men-are-born-to-be-different-33k2lvtn5?shareToken=2a2976e6335802e0b61b2f0f86e0092f&quot;&gt;Proof at last: women and men are born to be different&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this study live up to the claims made by its authors and, more excitedly, those passing the message on? I think not.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36954&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is certainly heroic in methodological terms, comprising a challenging recruitment and scanning strategy to capture “resting state” data (brain activity during rest rather than during an active task) from over 100 prenatal participants. As well as not having direct access to their participants, the experimenters had to devise extraordinarily complex ways of controlling for their movement – a challenge for any brain scan study, but particularly those hoping to measure connectivity. This involved the researchers identifying the “stillest” periods in each 12-24 minute foetal resting state scan, and then performing subsequent re-alignment and readjustments (or, effectively, cutting and pasting of each of lowest movement epochs together for analysis). We are told that 40 per cent of the acquired data had to be discarded in this process (something that should be borne in mind in assessing the validity and reliability of the data).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having identified 197 regions of interest (ROIs) in these foetal brain images, the researchers looked at how the activity in each region was correlated with the activity in all the others (a stronger correlation is taken as a sign of greater connectivity), resulting in an analysis of 19,306 connections or pairings between regions. The researchers then used an innovative method to identify significant clusterings in the data, to see if there were any networks or “hubs” of connectivity. It should be noted that the correlations were calculated separately for the males and females and that an uncorrected p-threshold of 0.05 was applied to the resulting correlations, both rather questionable statistical practices when working with data sets such as these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early versions of the overall methodological approach used here have previously been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929314000644?via=ihub&quot;&gt;reported by the same research team &lt;/a&gt;, providing fascinating insights into the formation of neural connectivity systems in utero and how these change with gestational age. The basis for the current paper is a much bigger data set than they used previously, which could have continued to develop these insights. Sadly, and rather inexplicably, their focus here is on differences in connectivity between female and male foetuses. This is unfortunate, not because identifying prenatal sex differences in the brain is not a crucial process in this debate, but because this data set just does not lend itself to this kind of “hunt-the-difference” agenda.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is that, of the 118 participants whose data survived all of the necessary exclusion criteria, 48 were female and 70 were male. This imbalance, together with the skewed distribution of several other demographic factors, such as gestational age when the scans took place, meant that the researchers had to use what are known as “nonparametric statistics” for many of their comparisons. This form of analysis, as well as lacking power, precludes the kind of multivariate analysis which would have allowed the researchers to consider multiple factors at once. For example, there was no way of &lt;i&gt;simultaneously&lt;/i&gt; testing the relative contributions of differences in gestational age and differences in foetal sex to different types of network pairs (connections between different brain regions). &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related problem is the wide age range of the participants: from 25 weeks to 39 gestational weeks. That 14 week period covers a time of dramatic cortical development, especially the formation of cortical networks – a 25 week-old brain will be very different from a 39 week-old one. Although the researchers treated gestational age as a continuous variable, there is a query as to the comparability of the male and female groups with respect to this measure. In the age window 36-40 weeks (very near full-term), there were 35 males compared with only 17 females. Even with appropriate statistical controls, this could well have skewed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this, there are concerns about the “normalisation” process carried out on each scan. This allows group analysis of images from different participants by “warping” them to a standard template so that locations on each image “line up” for comparison. What to select for a standard template is a tricky question for relatively comparable adult scans; here the researchers selected a 32-week foetal brain template, which could well have been inappropriate for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of the individual scans they were processing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False impressions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note what was NOT reported in this study. The researchers’ focus was almost entirely on the sex &lt;i&gt;differences&lt;/i&gt; they found, with little comment on evidence of the &lt;i&gt;sex similarities&lt;/i&gt;. In one of their figures, for example, the researchers illustrate 136 possible sex by connectivity comparisons, of which only 3 showed a statistically significant difference between the sexes. And remember that, overall, there were connections between over 19,000 possible regions to consider.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers use the term “sexual dimorphism” or “dimorphism” more than half a dozen times, including in that powerful statement from their abstract that I quoted at the start of my blog post. But their data do NOT demonstrate a dimorphic state – as well as the much greater incidence of &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; differences between the groups, we have no way of assessing just how different (or not) the connectivity pathways were. As so many of the sex-linked comparisons were based merely on contrasting the number of significant correlations between brain regions for males and females – for instance, one of the figures in the paper shows significant connectivity between 5 pairs of brain networks in female foetuses, as opposed to significant connectivity between 2 different brain networks in males – we have no idea of the effect size (the practical meaning) of any differences, nor the extent of overlap between the two groups.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any studies focussing on sex differences in the brain have the potential to help explain gender gaps, not only in behaviour, personality and preferences, but also in differences in the occurrence of physical and mental health problems. Studies such as this could be invaluable for understanding the typical and atypical developmental trajectories which may lead to such gaps. But, equally, studies such as this can contribute to stereotypical essentialist beliefs that there are innate, fixed and inevitable sex differences in the brain (and therefore in behaviour and preferences). This can have significant downstream consequences for how society comes to understand, explain and even sustain these very gender gaps.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data in this study offer an exciting and innovative look at the development of functional brain networks in the human brain, using complex and revelatory analyses. They do &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;offer confirmation of sexual dimorphism in human brain networks in utero and the authors of the study should not, I believe, be making this claim.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>A Swedish company called Emotra make a device to detect someone's risk of suicide based on measuring the body's autonomic responses to certain sounds. It's called EDOR®.



I've been blogging about this machine for the past 18 months (1, 2, 3) because such a product, if it worked, would be very important. It could help save countless lives. Unfortunately, I don't think EDOR® has been proven to be effective. As I've argued in my previous posts, the evidence just isn't there yet.

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Palm Beach County Students Compete in Max Planck Florida’s Brain Bee Challenge</title>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/palm-beach-county-students-compete-in-max-planck-floridas-brain-bee-challenge/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait…&lt;em&gt;Zombies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about &lt;span&gt;learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, ketamine and its downstream actions are involved in the creation of new spines on dendrites, and in the formation of new synapses.

(2019&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think we're still in the dark about why some humans can show immediate (albeit short-lived) relief from their unrelenting depression symptoms after ketamine infusion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moda-Sava et al.&lt;/a&gt; say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ketamine’s acute effects on depression-related behavior and circuit  function occur rapidly and &lt;u&gt;precede the onset of spine formation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which  in turn suggests that spine remodeling may be an activity-dependent  adaptation to changes in circuit function (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-83&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-83-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;83&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-88&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-88-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;88&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and is consistent with theoretical models implicating synaptic homeostasis mechanisms in depression and the stress response (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-89&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-89-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;89&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-90&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-90-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;90&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  Although not required for inducing ketamine’s effects acutely, these  newly formed spines are critical for sustaining the antidepressant  effect over time. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the problem is, depressed humans require constant treatment with ketamine to maintain any semblance of an effective clinical response, because the beneficial effect is fleeting. If we accept the possibility that ketamine acts through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mTOR&lt;/a&gt; signalling pathway, in the long run detrimental effects on the brain (and non-brain systems) may occur (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=ketamine+bladder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bladder damage&lt;/a&gt;, various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=mTOR+cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=psychosis+ketamine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychosis&lt;/a&gt;, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let's stay isolated in our silos, with our heads in the sand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/o_ceifero&quot;&gt;@o_ceifero&lt;/a&gt; for alerting me to this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/08/ketamine-for-depression-yay-or-neigh.html&quot;&gt;Ketamine for Depression: Yay or Neigh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/03/warning-about-ketamine-in-american.html&quot;&gt;Warning about Ketamine in the American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/chronic-ketamine-for-depression.html&quot;&gt;Chronic Ketamine for Depression: An Unethical Case Study?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/02/while-i-was-away.html&quot;&gt;still more on ketamine for depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/09/update-on-ketamine-in-palliative-care.html&quot;&gt;Update on Ketamine in Palliative Care Settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/03/07/ketamine-magic-antidepressant-or-expensive-illusion/&quot;&gt;Ketamine - Magic Antidepressant, or Expensive Illusion?&lt;/a&gt; - by Neuroskeptic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2013/05/27/fighting-depression-with-special-k/&quot;&gt;Fighting Depression with Special K&lt;/a&gt; - by Scicurious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/on-long-way-down-neurophenomenology-of.html&quot;&gt;On the Long Way Down: The Neurophenomenology of Ketamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moda-Sava RN, Murdock MH, Parekh PK, Fetcho RN, Huang BS, Huynh TN, Witztum J, Shaver DC, Rosenthal DL, Alway EJ, Lopez K, Meng Y, Nellissen L, Grosenick L, Milner TA, Deisseroth K, Bito H, Kasai H, Liston C.

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans.

	<title>BMC Series blog: The importance of negative results for family medicine</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/12/the-importance-of-negative-results-for-family-medicine/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/Family-Practice-HERO-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0924-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently published trial&lt;/a&gt; by de Kock, Noben, and colleagues, from the Netherlands, is a good example of something we often see in family medicine: a reasonably-sized trial of a plausible, complex intervention, which produces a negative result. In this case, the paper reports a trial of teaching additional skills to family physicians. The aim of these additional skills was to support people who were currently not working because of poor health to return to work.  We know that, in general, being in work is good for well-being (and wealth), so helping people return to work is a worthwhile aim. We also know that family physicians play a role in maintaining patients’ sickness absence, either directly through certification or indirectly by the advice they give for self-management. It is therefore plausible that an educational intervention for family physicians should have an effect. However, the trial found none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what went wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was certainly well-designed: it was a cluster randomized trial (280 patients from 26 practices) and it was conducted thoroughly. The investigators recognized that the trial might not be big enough to see a difference in hard outcomes like time off work, so they also used an intermediate outcome measure that was closer to the intervention. Specifically, they used a work-related measure of self-efficacy that correlates well with actual return to work. This meant their findings should have been less susceptible to individuals’ circumstances, such as their personal and occupational situation. But there was no effect on either outcome.  And perhaps that’s not surprising, because previous studies suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://oem.bmj.com/content/72/7/467.long&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;patient factors affected sickness certification&lt;/a&gt; more than practitioner factors and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10926-005-9003-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collaboration between general practitioner and occupational physician&lt;/a&gt; showed no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this study tell us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that this study teaches us two things. First, it reminds us we need to focus less on “complex interventions” and more on the “complex systems” within which these interventions happen. In their discussion, the authors fall into the trap of thinking “if only we had a better intervention” and suggest that better-tailored interventions might work. This is an appropriate way of thinking about relatively simple interventions – “if only we knew which drug to use for which patient…”, but with complex interventions it may be missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is because complex interventions are mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031912-114421&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interventions in complex systems&lt;/a&gt; not just in isolated individuals. And complex systems, such as patients’ networks of health, illness, home and work, have the property of absorbing (or buffering) most things which might change them. This doesn’t happen all the time, and indeed sometimes complex systems change dramatically in response to single inputs, but usually they just absorb them. The result is that well-designed complex interventions &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034222&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;frequently fail to show&lt;/a&gt; the neat, statistically significant effect that we expect. That is not because they are bad interventions, but because they are trying to change one aspect of something (or someone) in a much more complex network of things or people. And the effect of that complex network, or system, is usually to absorb the single change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing this study reminds us is that we need to share, internationally, what works and what doesn’t work in family medicine. Politicians, commentators and think-tanks across the world will keep coming up with ideas for making things better through family medicine. Not all of these ideas will be as smart as they first seem, and many will repeat the mistaken assumptions of earlier initiatives elsewhere. Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So entrenched is the association in our culture between coffee and ideas of arousal, ambition and focus that merely thinking about, or being reminded of, the drink is enough to increase the body’s arousal levels, in turn provoking a more focused, literal cognitive style. That’s according to Eugene Chan at Monash University and Sam Maglio at the University of Toronto Scarborough who, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018303350?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;reporting their findings in &lt;em&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, write that “… people may be more aroused simply after walking by a coffee shop. Not only would they be more aroused, but at a more downstream level, their decision making might shift as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intriguing results come from four studies involving hundreds of online and lab-based participants, but given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;replication problems&lt;/a&gt; in the general area of “social priming” (concerned with how abstract ideas and sensory experiences can influence thoughts and behaviour, and vice versa), some readers may find that merely hearing about this new research is enough to elevate their pulse and alter their mindset to a more sceptical mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36914&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four studies followed a similar pattern and no drinks were actually ingested. They started with participants being cued to think about either coffee or tea. In one study, they had to come up with advertising slogans for coffee or tea (depending on which group they were allocated to); in the other studies, they read either a mocked-up health news story about the benefits of drinking coffee or a version pertaining to tea. These reminders were then followed by a measure of the participants’ physiological arousal levels, either self-reported (they rated how alert, energetic and excited they were feeling) or based on their heart-rate. And finally, the participants completed a measure of their construal level – essentially how much they were thinking in a focused or literal way, or more abstractly. This final measure mostly took the form of categorising activities, such as deciding whether “making a list” is an example of “getting organised” (more abstract) or “writing things down” (more literal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results showed that thinking about and being reminded of coffee increased participants’ physiological arousal levels (whether self-reported or based on heart-rate), compared with thinking about and being reminded of tea, and in turn this greater arousal prompted a more literal, focused thinking style – that is, a lower, more concrete construal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the studies showed that this arousing, cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders only played out for Western participants, not for participants from Eastern countries (recent immigrants to Canada and America from China, Japan and Korea) where coffee is less popular and does not have the same connotations related to energy, focus and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study showed that the cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders was enhanced by watching an exciting clip from the &lt;em&gt;Fast and Furious&lt;/em&gt; movie and nullified by a clip from the less exciting &lt;em&gt;House of Rock&lt;/em&gt;, which the researchers said bolstered the idea that the effect of the coffee reminders on thinking style was acting via the changes it induced in arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that they were agnostic on whether these apparent effects of coffee reminders are advantageous or not – presumably it would depend on the circumstances. They called for more research to explore the implications of their findings, concluding that “our research adds to the literature documenting that the foods we eat and the beverages we drink do more than simply providing nutrition or pleasure. Mere exposure to or reminders of them can affect how we think.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers might understandably question the practical significance of the effects documented here (for some perspective, the average heart rate for the coffee group was 76 beats per minute, compared with 70 beats per minute for the tea group), and will probably want to see the findings replicated before reading too much into them. Another issue was that there was no baseline condition, rather the coffee reminders were always compared to tea reminders. Therefore one could arguably interpret the results as showing that reminders of tea reduce arousal and induce a more abstract thinking style, rather than that coffee increases arousal and induces a concrete thinking style. Chan and Maglio acknowledged the need for follow-up research, writing “we await further work to replicate our basic effects, providing practitioners and researchers further credence in the validity and reliability of the findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else feeling thirsty?&lt;/p&gt;
