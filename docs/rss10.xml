&lt;p&gt;The experiences of people who’ve been through a gender transition have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977075/&quot;&gt;studied and analysed&lt;/a&gt; by psychologists – showing, for example, improved psychological wellbeing and self-esteem after hormone treatment. But when it comes to their partners, there’s been much less research. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407517709360?ai=1gvoi&amp;amp;mi=3ricys&amp;amp;af=R&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/i&gt;, though, they often go through a kind of life transition of their own, and while there are certainly challenges, there are often positive changes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25437&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Platt at West Virginia University, US and Kayla Bolland at New Mexico State University conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 partners of transgender people – these partners were both female to male and male to female, plus there was a group that identified as gender neutral or fluid. The interviewees themselves were mostly not heterosexual, they lived in the US or Canada, and they included 13 cisgender women (women who’s gender identity matches their birth sex), 2 cisgender men, 4 transgender people, and 2 people with fluid or bi-gender identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the interviewees had started their relationship after their transgender partner had transitioned; others were in their relationship before their partner had begun their transition process. Although there’s a common perception that relationships usually end when one member changes gender, this isn’t necessarily the case. For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://uh.edu/class/psychology/clinical-psych/research/dpl/_files/publications/Meier-Sharp-Michonski-Babcock-and-Fitzgerald_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, about half of a group of transgender men who were in relationship before their transition kept up that relationship afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews involved open-ended questions, such as “Discuss how your relationship has impacted your sexual orientation, if at all?”. Many of the participants reported practical safety concerns for their transgender partners, such as physical attacks from hostile members of the public. But there were concerns relating to their own psychological wellbeing, too. Most had previous connections in the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer) community, the researchers wrote, but as a partner of a transgender person, they felt excluded and marginalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one woman whose partner had made a female to male transition (FTM) had previously identified as lesbian, but now identified as queer – a less-specific term for a non-straight sexual orientation. Many interviewees felt this better described their sexual orientation after their partner transitioned – they don’t feel straight, but not gay or lesbian any more, either. “Do we still fit in the lesbian community?” the woman asked, “it’s something we’re still trying to figure out.” Another interviewee, also a female partner of someone who had made the FTM  transition, said, “You do give up something as a partner because you’re all lesbians together and a lot of lesbians don’t like it when other lesbians transition. I don’t know why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One participant explained how she felt ignored. “Everything is always about trans people, trans people, trans people. And you know, partners are completely eclipsed – and our sexuality is completely eclipsed, and we have no voice in the community really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, many reported undergoing major changes in their own lives. Physical changes to their partner meant changed sexual experiences, for example, and many reported questioning their own sexual orientation, or relabelling themselves (with the term queer, for instance). But some reported that this was a positive experience (“It’s definitely opened my eyes to helping me understand myself better and what I’m attracted to and not be putting myself in a box like I used to,” said one.) Some also talked about having a welcome, new understanding of the gender spectrum, and about how the need for more communication about what feels comfortable for both partners led to greater closeness and intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s important to remember, one interviewee stressed, “that as your partner transitions, what you’re going through is a transition of your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is a little-researched area, there are organisations that provide advice to partners of trans people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Whilst research into the health of this vulnerable population is increasing, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0116-4&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; bibliometric analysis, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC International Health &amp;amp; Human Rights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are still many challenges on how best to reach and treat refugees.  Below we discuss a selection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; research into the health challenges experienced by refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many refugees have suffered physical or psychological stress it is perhaps unsurprising that mental health conditions are prevalent in the population. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1239-9&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the prevalence of mental health illness amongst refugees and asylum-seekers in Australia was measured at 50.4%, with approximately a third having had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at some point. In a Danish &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1166-1&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of refugees it was shown PTSD was sometimes accompanied by secondary psychotic symptoms, likely to be linked to severe interpersonal traumas such as torture and imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3953-5&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the rates of depressive symptoms in African asylum-seekers and refugees in Hong Kong was examined. Whilst a significant proportion of this population exhibited depressive symptoms those who lived alone were more likely to suffer. In addition those who reported discrimination or difficulties accessing healthcare also had an increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms highlighting the value of social support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have looked at why refugee populations find healthcare difficult to access. Primary healthcare workers (HCWs) are aware of the issues refugees face and in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1048-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, from Switzerland, HCWs identified a lack of adequate financial resources, housing, and access to employment as important factors in creating barriers to accessing healthcare. In addition the HCWs considered that a lack of information about services and a fear of stigmatization were preventing refugees from accessing mental healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refugee youth are at elevated risk of mental health and alcohol and other drug problems and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4186-y&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; study looking at refugee youths in South Australia highlighted a lack of awareness of services and the fragmented nature of them as causing major barriers to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to mental health conditions there are other areas where refugees are at an increased risk. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-016-0085-z&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that children of North Korean refugees in China had significantly lower vaccination rates compared to Chinese or migrant children. Unvaccinated children are at risk of many preventable infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-017-0888-7&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece were shown to commonly lack immunization records, have poor dental health and present with elevated blood lead levels. Many of the conditions reported were manageable but if undiagnosed or left untreated, could lead to poor health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubtless the work discussed in this blog barely scratches the surface of the challenges facing refugee populations across the world. Clearly further research is needed and, even more importantly, concerted action required from governments and NGOs to tackle these issues and improve the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs308/en/&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; 5% of the world’s population carries a hemoglobin disorder gene and 300,000 infants are born each year with hemoglobin disorders including SCD. Furthermore, the vast majority of cases of SCD occur in sub-saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCD is a genetic disorder which results in a mutation in the hemoglobin gene and causes red blood cells to develop into a misshapen, sickle-like shape.  These red blood cells will stick to the inside of blood vessels thereby blocking appropriate blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9153&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9153 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Sickle_cell_distribution-300x205.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Distribution of the sickle-cell trait shown in pink and purple (By Muntuwandi at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCD dramatically &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-017-0079-7&quot;&gt;reduces the quality of life&lt;/a&gt; due to a wide variety complications including chronic anemia, gall stone disease, painful crisis, refractive eye disorders, heart disease, chronic leg ulcers, septic arthritis, and enuresis.  Individuals with SCD are also more susceptible to infections such a tuberculosis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some well-established behavioral and drug techniques have been discovered to reduce SCD symptomology and include restriction from strenuous activity, giving plenty of fluids, balanced diet, dressing in warm clothing, anti-malarial drugs, and analgesics.  These treatments are often used to manage symptoms but not necessarily the physiological repercussions of having SCD. One potential treatment that has received some recent attention is Gum Arabic comes from the Acacia Senegal tree, and it has potential for treating SCD in more than one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gum Arabic has been found to have potent anti-oxidant properties and has been shown to act as an effective anti-oxidant in animal models of chronic renal failure, urinary bladder cytotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. Individuals with SCD have high levels of oxidative stress due to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. High levels of oxidative stress can have serious physiological repercussions such as endometrial dysfunction and multiple organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9156&quot; style=&quot;width: 198px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9156&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Sickle_cell_01-188x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Wikipedia, public domain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-017-0075-y&quot;&gt;Kaddan and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; sought to determine whether Gum Arabic’s anti-oxidant effects could reduce the high levels of oxidative stress in individuals with SCD. Daily administration of Gum Arabic for 12 weeks resulted in an increase in total anti-oxidants and a reduction of the reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, as well as a decrease in malondiadehyde, an indicator of oxidative stress. Despite these positive findings, it is important to note that the authors measured only certain markers of oxidative stress and other physiological measures were not taken therefore it is difficult to conclude whether these anti-oxidative effects could actually reduce organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gum Arabic could have beneficial effects beyond its anti-oxidant properties. Gum Arabic could also increase the production of fetal hemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin with a greater affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin appears to prevent red blood cells from forming the sickle shape thereby decreasing the chance of vaso-occlusive events. Hydroxyurea is an FDA approved drug that can increase fetal hemoglobin, however, since the drug is expensive and patients require frequent monitoring for toxicity hydroxyurea is not a realistic treatment for individuals in developing countries. Gum Arabic, however, is considered a safe dietary fiber and when orally administered for twelve weeks both &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-015-0040-6&quot;&gt;children and adults experience an increase in fetal hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;. These results seem promising but since neither painful crisis nor vaso-occlusive events were measured it is unclear whether this increase in fetal hemoglobin would have significant physiological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a significant amount of research required to find effective treatments in stabilizing, if not curing, this debilitating disease that results in low quality of life and an increased risk of premature death. Hopefully, when every World Sickle Disease Day arrives there will be more and more treatments to help this population. With foundations such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://sicklecellfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Sickle Cell Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sicklecellcurefoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Sickle Cell Cure Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and sources of public funding the lives of these afflicted individuals will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esf.edu/top10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Top 10 New Species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; list honors the legacy of Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, known for his pioneering work on the hierarchical classification of plants and animals that developed beyond genus and species into modern taxonomy. The list is compiled by the International Institute for Species Exploration (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esf.edu/species/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IISE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) working with a panel of international scientists as selection committee members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7629&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-7629&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/06/Q.Wheeler-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;SUNY-ESF President Quentin Wheeler. (Photos for SUNY-ESF by M.J. Okoniewski)&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS spoke with Quentin Wheeler, founding director of IISE and president of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York, on assessing research impact, the purpose and influence of this list and the impact of climate change on species diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies and Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research reporting these new species is published in a variety of journal types, from subscription to Open Access. When asked if there are considerations of access to research when the members of the international selection committee evaluate nominations, Wheeler states that “the selection committee is encouraged to focus on the organisms rather than where they were published.” This de-emphasis on journal choice is a hallmark of the IISE selection process; work that is posted on a preprint server, rather than published in a peer-reviewed journal, may also be eligible for consideration. “What matters is compliance with the international codes of (botanical and zoological) nomenclature which requires publication that can now include electronic publication. So long as the requirements of the code were met during the previous calendar year, a species is eligible for consideration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of continued global extinction of animals, plants and microbes, Wheeler hopes the Top 10 New Species list brings research outcomes to the public that help convey the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acute relevance of climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our goal is to increase awareness of the loss of species in the biodiversity crisis and the important roles played by taxonomy and natural history museums in biodiversity exploration and conservation. The wide media attention gained by the Top 10 (and this year’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/related?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156709&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) has hopefully played a role toward that goal,” he says. While he is not aware of specific policies shaped directly by the list, the hope is that it “keeps the importance of species exploration in the minds of those making such policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuing Work, Not Impact Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years of generating this list, one notable detail is that selected work is published in journals with impact factors ranging from less than one to greater than 20. When asked what this says to him and the scientific community about the value and relevance of evaluating a work based on its own merit, rather than on the journal in which it appears, Wheeler is quite direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a scientist and scholar, I like to think that science is a meritocracy of ideas and that their value derives from the quality of the work and its impact rather than the impact factor of the journal overall. Taxonomy is a very special case that is not at all served well by impact factors as they are today calculated.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains this concept more fully. “First, the best taxonomic work is comprehensive and comparative in the form of lengthy taxonomic revisions and monographs. Such long works are not accepted by most journals with high impact factors. Second, even the best taxonomic work is rarely cited because once species are known they are typically identified by field biologists through secondary literature (field guides, etc.). Even the secondary literature is often omitted from citations by ecologists and others, and the primary literature is only rarely cited outside of other taxonomy papers.” Due to the long-term nature of taxonomy work, “we routinely consult papers from 1758 forward,” says Wheeler. “Thus the true impact of the work is measured over generations which is quite different from most experimental fields where papers are outdated in just a few years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esf.edu/top10/2016/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two species on the list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; made their debuts in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;: the description of a new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138779&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Galapagos giant tortoise species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genus, species and subfamily of isopod crustacean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Together with this year’s winner and the four &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/07/key-new-species-discoveries-2014/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; describing top species in 2014, this cohort of articles has collectively received over 290,000 views, 3,500 shares and broad media coverage since publication, indicating their influence and interest for taxonomists and the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity and Credit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other scientific disciplines, innovation and modernization are a must in taxonomy, and Wheeler is in favor of such policy shifts. First, he recommends mandating a “central deposition of all nomenclatural acts, including descriptions of new species” as it now takes several years to track down all new species named in any given year. He also believes “the actual technical description of species should be open access, even in journals that are not. The descriptive material should be intellectual property of humankind and available to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further modernization, according to Wheeler, would establish electronic connectivity between published work and the central repository. “That central repository, likely IPNI for botany and ZooBank for zoology,” he says, “ought to be connected via hyperlink to every scientific name published. Were this done it would be a service to editors by assuring the correct scientific name is being used and spelled correctly. Also by virtue of that link we could electronically track the usage of scientific names and give “impact” measure of the use of the names as credit to the taxonomists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS encourages scientists making these discoveries to publish the entire research article, not just the technical data, in fully Open Access journals and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure the work has maximum visibility and reach. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/orcid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ORCID iDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can help in linking taxonomy descriptions, datasets, published work and grants to individual researchers for maximum credit and recognition. Those interested in learning more about the biodiversity crisis can watch a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-MbJw57LXM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brief interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with Quentin Wheeler and those interested in learning more about new species and biodiversity can browse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/TaxonomyNewSpecies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this selection of PLOS articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After chemotherapy treatment, many patients say their mind has been affected. For example they describe symptoms such as feeling confused, memory problems and difficulty concentrating – a phenomenon that has been dubbed “chemobrain” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/chemotherapy/side-effects-chemotherapy/chemo-brain/about&quot;&gt;Cancer Research UK has more information&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes are little understood. Are these apparent neuropsychological effects due to a direct physical effect of chemotherapy on the brain? Or could it be the stress and worry involved in chemotherapy that is responsible? Perhaps it’s both. To find out more, Mi Sook Jung at Chungnam National University in South Korea, and colleagues, conducted repeated brain scans and neuropsych tests with breast cancer patients undergoing chemo and compared them with similar cancer patients not on chemo and healthy controls. Reporting their &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9507-8?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain Imaging and Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers hope a better understanding of the nature of “chemobrain” and its causes will make it possible for health professionals to offer patients better support and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25198&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were 28 women who’d had surgery for breast cancer and were waiting to start chemo; 34 women with breast cancer of similar severity, also post-surgery, but awaiting radiotherapy without chemo; and 30 age-matched healthy controls (average age across groups was 52, and the women were predominantly white and well-educated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On three occasions, all the participants completed tests of their verbal working memory while having their brains scanned. To provide a baseline, they completed their first tests before the chemo group had begun their chemotherapy treatment; the second test was at least one month after chemo; and the third and final test was 12 months after the baseline (and 7 months after chemotherapy for the chemo group). The women also reported their cancer symptoms, any cognitive complains and psychological stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemo patients performed worse at the memory task, and their lower performance became more obvious over the course of the year: whereas the other patients and healthy controls improved on each test (just as you’d expect with repeated practice), the chemo patients did not. Throughout, the chemotherapy patients’ brain scans also showed some signs of a lack of neural efficiency at the front of their brains while they completed the memory tests, although this only reached statistical significance in comparison with the other groups at the final test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of subjective cognitive complaints (for example, how much the participants said they experience memory problems in everyday life), there were actually no group differences. In other words, if the researchers had relied on self-report, rather than conducting memory tests and brain scans, they wouldn’t have found evidence for chemobrain as such. Across all the cancer patients, the greater their psychological distress and the more severe their cancer symptoms, the more that they tended to complain of cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers said there could be two distinct phenomena here: the subjective cognitive problems associated with cancer may be caused predominantly by anxiety and the burden of cancer symptoms; at the same time, chemotherapy may be having an additional, compounding effect on brain function, which showed up in the memory tests and brain scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on why chemotherapy treatment has these additional adverse effects, the researchers believe part of this is likely the anxiety and stress specifically involved in the chemotherapy experience, such as anticipation of hair loss and other toxic effects. Supporting this, the chemo patients actually showed some signs of altered brain function even before they’d started their chemotherapy.  However, having chemotherapy was still associated with greater risk of neural inefficiency, even after putting levels of psychological distress into the analysis, which points to a direct organic effect of chemotherapy on the brain, compounding the psychological toll (stronger evidence for a direct organic effect of chemotherapy on brain function, separate from psychological causes, would require a controlled experiment with some patients allocated to a “sham” chemotherapy condition, though this would surely be unethical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively small study with complex findings and much more research is clearly needed, including into how and why chemotherapy might directly effect brain function. The researchers said “considerable research is underway to identify biological mechanisms by which chemotherapy alters neural function (e.g., inflammatory cytokine production, genetic predisposition), [but that] research also is needed to explicate the mechanism linking symptom burden and self-reported cognitive problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition of microbial pathogens is key for innate immune function. This is done in macrophages by intracellular receptors known as NLRs, which then activate the inflammasome to defend against colonization by intracellular bacteria. Salmonella, however, has developed effectors that allow it to evade the inflammasome response. This study used recombinant Salmonella to test whether inflammasome activation could be triggered and whether that would affect bacterial colonization in vivo in mice. It was found that the recombinant bacteria increased activation of the inflammasome, thereby reducing bacterial counts and organ damage in the infected mice. This could lead to general application in vaccine design, encouraging activation of the immune system against a range of intracellular pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0186-z&quot;&gt;Why do violent criminals fight more than other criminal offenders?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of facial expression is an important element of regulating social interaction. A recent study compared hostile attribution bias in violent criminals as compared to non-violent offenders and controls in the general population. Hostile attribution bias is the interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions as hostile, often leading to aggressive behavior. Violent offenders showed greater hostile attribution bias than non-violent offenders or controls, suggesting one mechanism underlying a tendency towards physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As electronic health record (EHR) use becomes more common, more negative effects are seen on the physician-patient relationship from the use of EHR. While several recommendations have been published to try to mitigate these effects, few studies have tested whether these recommendations are helpful in real patient interactions. A new study aimed to introduce training on EHR-related communication skills of residents with real patients and asses its impact on physician-patient interactions. After the training, physicians said that they were more comfortable using EHR overall and were seen to be using it less in situations where patients might feel that it was a barrier to communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method of overcoming the growing problem of antibiotic resistance is the use of combination therapies, two or more antibiotic drugs together. Identifying which drugs are most effective together is complicated by the rare occurrence of suppressive interactions, in which the drugs together are less effective than either alone. These suppressive combinations, while they are less effective at killing bacteria, may be better for combating the development of antibiotic resistance. This study looked for suppressive interactions in three-drug combinations, especially “emergent” suppressive interactions that reduce growth better than the single drugs but not as well as the pairwise combinations. Fourteen antibiotic drugs were tested in all possible combinations on three strains of bacteria. Pairwise suppressive interactions were rare, with only 5% of combinations failing to reduce growth more than the single drugs but 17% of three-drug combinations showing suppressive interaction as compared to the pairwise combinations. These emergent suppressive interactions may be clinically useful to balance between the needs of effective killing of bacteria in an individual patient and reducing the development of antibiotic resistance across a population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant cuticle is the outermost tissue layer and it is important in protecting the plant from environmental stresses, such as drought. Cuticle properties such as wax composition and glaucousness may control water loss and thereby contribute to drought tolerance. A new study examined water loss in five strains of wheat to compare leaf cuticle properties between strains with different drought tolerances and within strains grown in drought and non-drought conditions. The relationship found between cuticle properties and drought tolerance was not simple and included changes in wax composition, amount, and crystal structure. These relationships could be useful for selecting plants with higher drought resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is an essential contributor to healthy child development and lack of sleep can contribute to obesity, low academic achievement, and other negative outcomes for children and their families. Parental behaviors can significantly influence child sleep quality and duration both positively and negatively. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of various parental behaviors intended to support healthy sleep to children meeting healthy sleep guidelines. The results of the survey show that parental enforcement of bedtime rules, not just encouragement to follow routine, predicted increased sleep duration in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, while investigating rabbits’ sense of smell by recording the activity of their brain cells, the scientist Lord Adrian noticed something curious. As his team mixed up odours of increasing strength, to see at what point the rabbits’ neurons fired in response, they found the critical threshold appeared around the same point that they were able to smell the odour themselves: in other words, this suggested that the smell had become noticeable to animal and man at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On publication of the research, Lord Adrian mentioned his observation, but it didn’t provoke a serious response, presumably because informed scientists knew that the human sense of smell is generally pathetic. Everyone knew… but they knew wrong. In a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263.full&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, John McGann, who runs the Rutgers Laboratory on the Neurobiology of Sensory Cognition, takes us through the historical misunderstandings to reach the truth about what the human nose knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25280&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the idea that humans can’t smell very well begins with the French neuroanatomist Paul Broca (immortalised through &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%25252527s_area&quot;&gt;Broca’s&lt;/a&gt; brain area), who, facing hostility from the Catholic Church, was defiantly set on making the case for a unique human intelligence that wasn’t due to an invisible soul, but to physical brain features, specifically our large frontal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tighten his story, Broca suggested that, in humans, the notably small brain volume taken up by the olfactory bulb, which processes smell (biologists call the sense of smell “olfaction”), reflected a redirection of resources from smell, which guides lower animals, into the higher functions. His argument gained intuitive strength from the fact that in humans the small bulb sits directly against the expanded frontal area. This supported the idea that a poor human sense of smell testifies to human exceptionalism, to our separation from the lowly beast. You can also see this theme in Freud’s work: he claimed smell was connected to instinctual sexual behaviour, and that although it was “usually atrophied” in humans, it connected us “to early animal forms of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Broca’s original neuroanatomical case doesn’t hold much water. Yes, the human olfactory bulb is small compared to the rest of our (relatively large) brain, but the same is true in other animals. Although across the animal kingdom the brain scales up in relation to body size (larger animals require larger somatosensory systems to represent their greater skin surface, which is why elephants and whales have enormous brains), the olfactory bulb is an important exception to this rule. This might be because however big or small you are, smell always begins at the nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different indicator of smell specialisation could be the density of neurons in the olfactory bulb, but this density doesn’t vary greatly from species to species either, and what difference there is doesn’t give us a clear picture: although the bulb of a mouse is neurally denser than that of a human male, it’s less dense than that of a human female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, there are differences in the human olfactory system compared with other animals: for instance, a lack of adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (in humans the growth of new neurons occurs in other regions including the hippocampus and striatum). This could be taken as evidence of less “plasticity” in the human smell system. However, humans appear well-able to adjust and learn to pick up even previously imperceptible smells, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369149&quot;&gt;through aversive conditioning&lt;/a&gt;, possibly through reuse of the existing neural resources. So the neuroanatomical evidence that we have feeble odour-detecting isn’t compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the proof is in the smelling. But before you picture the trusted tracker dog, or mouse questing for cheese, ask yourself whether they, like some humans, would be able to distinguish own-brand from top-end potato crisps, or tell a Merlot from a Pinot Noir. Because the truth is, Lord Adrian’s observation reflects a wider truth: while in some instances our sense of smell falls well behind other mammals, in others, it proves itself a match, and in others still, comes out the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As McGann points out, “humans with intact olfactory systems can detect virtually all volatile chemicals larger than an atom or two, to the point that it has been a matter of scientific interest to document the few odorants that some people cannot smell.” Recent research suggests we may be able to theoretically distinguish between, not thousands of different odorants, but up to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653035&quot;&gt;trillion&lt;/a&gt;! The exact smell matter is critical. For example, on two chemically related compounds, humans outperformed mice on one, but lagged behind them on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection, this tallies well with the human experience. It’s clear that, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time%2523Memory&quot;&gt;Proust’s experience with his madeleine cake&lt;/a&gt;, smell has a great power &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575071&quot;&gt;to evoke memory&lt;/a&gt;; that it guides matters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637403&quot;&gt;physical attraction&lt;/a&gt;; that it can tip us off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309140/&quot;&gt;someone’s emotional state&lt;/a&gt;. The texts that once categorised us as an “anosmatic” species – without smell, like dolphins and whales – got it way wrong, brought off course by ideology and a reluctance to actually look at the facts. Luckily, many scientists since have gone on to do the necessary work, by following their noses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263.full&quot;&gt;Poor human olfaction is a 19th-century myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com-Dog-Walking-Animal-Dogs-Pet-Walking-Dog-Walk-1070076-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could attribute many of a dog’s characteristics to why they’re known as “man’s best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re loyal, entertaining, trustworthy — they won’t tell a soul how long you binge-watched Netflix last weekend — and of course, they’re adorable. But when you’re not cuddled up together streaming shows, dogs can give their owners one of the greatest gifts of all: improved health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have studied the influence of dog ownership on physical activity many times, and almost every study has found the same to be true: Owning a dog will cause a person’s activity level to increase and be higher in comparison to those who don’t have a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The average dog owner walks more than non-owners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glasgow Caledonian University researchers found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one might seem obvious, but having a dog essentially forces owners to exercise more than they might have without a pet. This statistic appears to hold true, especially regarding owners ages 65 and up. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-largest-aging-population-in-the-world.html&quot;&gt;populations around the world&lt;/a&gt; continue to age, keeping older people active could be imperative to countries’ continued economic growth and the daily functioning of societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4422-5&quot;&gt;Glasgow Caledonian University researchers&lt;/a&gt; found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to spending more of their time walking, the study found dog owners had less frequent sedentary periods than non-dog owners. Though the amount of time spent sitting down was the same among the two groups, simply getting up and moving more frequently is enough to boost your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To collect this data, researchers used a case-controlled design in which study participants were matched using a range of demographic variables. Participants were recruited using ads at local community groups, veterinary offices and local radio and press outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final sample size included 40 adults aged 65 and older, who resided at private residences and had no scheduled health interventions that could bias their physical activity during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dogs encourage people with medical conditions to get outside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9145 alignright&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/34414326953_747d49f1a9_z-2-300x249.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;For individuals who have medical conditions that could act up at any time, simply going outside for a walk could be nerve-wracking. If this is you, consider choosing a service dog as your pet. These animals not only provide the same benefits as an ordinary pet, but they also give their owners feelings of independence, courage and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service dogs could be helpful for people with autism, diabetes, vision impairments, deafness and more. There are even dogs &lt;a href=&quot;http://k94life.org/seizure-alert/&quot;&gt;trained to help people&lt;/a&gt; who suffer from seizures. Individuals who suffer from emotional problems such as panic attacks, separation anxiety, depression or dyslexia could find that service dogs can improve their quality of life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: dogs motivate owners to exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been feeling like you need a reason to get up and move — and you’re potentially a bit lonely — getting a dog could be beneficial to you. Of course you should always consider whether you are in a position to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/choosing-a-pet&quot;&gt;appropriately care&lt;/a&gt; for a potential pet’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the unconditional love and new adventures your new four-legged friend will bring into your life, you’ll most likely be exercising more frequently and improving both of your well-beings. Now, that’s love.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Testing the potential for adaptation to climate change</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/16/testing-potential-adaptation-climate-change/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/1280px-Water_snail_Rex_2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations of numerous species are currently threatened by global climate change. Many species have already shown range shifts as a response to changing climatic conditions. This can increase their probability to survive in the future. However, many species are not able to disperse as effectively as required, and even those that can will experience new and often suboptimal environmental conditions outside their current range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the limitations of “quick fixes” in front of climate change, the persistence of natural populations of many organisms will depend on their ability to evolutionarily adapt to changing climatic conditions to overcome their negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately evolutionary adaptation is never guaranteed. A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable variation across individuals in the traits determining fitness (i.e. survival and reproductive success). In case of climate change, this would mean that the harmful effects of altered climatic conditions (e.g. heat waves, droughts) on natural populations would become smaller in the future only if (1) individuals showed variation in their sensitivity to climate change-mediated stress, (2) this helped them to produce more offspring compared with other individuals in the population, and (3) also their offspring showed higher tolerance to altered climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9140&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9140&quot; height=&quot;930&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Lstagnalis_seppala-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Great pond snails (&lt;em&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Photo by Otto Seppälä&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the adaptive potential in responses to heat waves in a population of the great pond snail (&lt;em&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/em&gt;). These snails are common in freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere. They are important grazers in their habitats, and serve as intermediate hosts for a community of parasites some of which cause wide losses, for instance, in aquaculture. Thus, their responses and potential for adaptation to climate change can have wide consequences for ecosystem functioning and disease epidemiology in freshwater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exposing snails to experimental heat waves in a laboratory we found that at high temperatures, snails grew larger and reproduced more while their immune defence (two out of three examined immune traits) was reduced. Thus, snails gained immediate benefits in form of high growth rate and reproductive output during a heat wave, but this came with a cost of reduced parasite resistance. Could the snails evolve to experience smaller costs during future heat waves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining snails from different families within the population revealed that although the investigated traits showed high genetic variation, their responses to high temperature were largely similar. Only one of the studied immune traits showed variation across families in its reduction under a heat wave. Therefore, individuals whose immune function suffered the least from high temperature could pass this ability to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that snails show some genetic potential for adaptation to climate change. This may reduce the negative effects of heat waves on snail resistance against parasites in the future, thus reducing the disease risk induced by extreme weather conditions. These effects were, however, limited since most of the examined traits did not show such variation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Oscillatory Thoughts: The Language of Peer Review</title>
	<link>http://blog.ketyov.com/2014/06/the-language-of-peer-review.html</link>
	<content:encoded>When I sent off the draft of my first paper to my PhD advisor I really felt like all the hard work was finished. I'd spent years getting my project started: getting IRB approval, identifying subjects, collecting data, and so on. Then I spent many more months analyzing the data, pouring over every detail. Then I spent many more months putting together figures and writing the draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's only the tip of the iceberg. Let's get into my personal statistics (since those are the data from which I have to draw) to show you the language of peer review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years I've been co-author on 15 research manuscripts, of which I have been the main author on 7. I currently have 3 more that have undergone at least one round of peer review. These 10 first-author manuscripts have &lt;i&gt;collectively&lt;/i&gt; undergone about 20 rounds of review, each consisting of 2-4 reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 16,000 words have been written by reviewers about these 10 papers. In response to &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, I have written over 14,000 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, the total word length for all 10 of these papers comes in at around 40,000 or so (not including references). This means that, for every paper I write, I will probably have to write around 35% &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than what I consider to be the &quot;final&quot; version in order to justify its publication to reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind next time you try to estimate how much longer it will take for you to publish your manuscript. I often forget this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the flip side, I've performed approximately 25 reviews for some of the most prestigious journals in cognitive neuroscience including: &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cerebral Cortex&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these 25 reviews I have written over 14,000 words. That may seem light at only ~560 words per review but my personal reviewing philosophy is to be concise but thorough. It is much easier to critique than to create!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not experienced it, peer review is a strange affair. It's sort of like a masquerade ball in that peoples' identities are unknown (at least in one direction), but you know that you'll probably have to see these people unmasked at some point so you better give the appearance of propriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of weird and interesting language play and kowtowing, with phrases such as &quot;we thank the reviewers for their insightful comments&quot; and &quot;this is a very interesting manuscript, but...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word of the day is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asteism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asteism&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: &quot;Polite irony; a genteel and ingenious manner of deriding another.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This generally sums up the peer-review process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just out of curiosity I decided to run all my reviews, comments received by reviewers, and response to reviewers through a tag cloud generator (thank you &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagcrowd.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tagcrowd&lt;/a&gt;) just to see what it looked like. Check it out, I believe this to be a decent, quick insight into the language of peer-review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s400/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You'll notice right away that certain keywords appear that represent the general class of manuscripts I'm asked to review: &quot;EEG&quot;, &quot;coupling&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, and so on. The appearance of words such as &quot;addressed&quot;, &quot;important&quot;, and &quot;interesting&quot; belie the kinds of language I use (I generally &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find most papers I review to be genuinely interesting, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments Received by Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s400/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here again you see &quot;interesting&quot; appear. Everyone is interesting! We're all special snowflakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good exercise for me though because I can see that reviewers have a tendency to use words like &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;literature&quot; against me. When I write I have a tendency to &quot;jump ahead&quot; and just assume that people will follow my logic without &quot;showing my work&quot;. This is sloppy on my part and I struggle with the need to explicitly connect my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has to remind me of this fact for every. Single. Paper. That I write. For every talk I give. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response to Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s1600/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s400/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great. You see how &quot;reviewer&quot;, &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;thank&quot;, and &quot;suggested&quot; show up a lot in my response to reviewers? This is another interesting aspect of peer review. This shows the deferential language that scientists use in responding to their peers. This represents all the times I've said, &quot;the reviewer is correct&quot; and &quot;we thank the reviewers for their suggestions&quot; and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this was my attempt to peel back the curtain on peer review a bit if you don't have a lot of experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have a clever or insightful ending for this post, so, uh, I'd like to thank the readers for their valuable time and for the intelligent, thought-provoking comments that are sure to follow.</content:encoded>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Life-long binge-drinking and high alcohol consumption increase diabetes risk for women</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/15/alcohol-and-diabetes-in-women/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/wine-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol plays an important part in the social life of humans, and from early life on. Any minor and major life event is celebrated with alcohol, and many friendships and business deals are formed over a drink. However, the strong role that alcohol plays in our daily life might make it difficult to objectively assess its less positive effects on us, such as its influence on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drinking large amounts of alcohol is generally considered bad for one’s health, it has also been assumed that moderate consumption could pose health benefits. There is even scientific evidence suggesting some advantages of moderate alcohol consumption over abstinence, for example in &lt;a href=&quot;http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/3/719&quot;&gt;reducing the risk for type-2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. However, in an ambitious 27-year study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4437-y&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Karina Nygren and colleagues from the University of Umeå in Sweden have now refuted this suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By documenting the drinking habits of more than 800 persons in a mid-sized Swedish community from the age of 16 to the age of 43, the researchers were able to show that medium alcohol consumption did in fact not help to prevent diabetes – the level of glucose in one’s blood (which can be an early indicator for type-2 diabetes risk) was no lower for participants that reported consuming medium amounts of alcohol between the ages 16 to 43 than for those who had only consumed little alcohol in those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this study also allowed new insight to how long-term drinking behavior might have different effects on women and men. Although the men included in the study consumed much more alcohol than the women, and more men than women reported binge-drinking, it might be female heavy drinkers that are especially at risk for developing type-2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women who reportedly drank the highest volumes of alcohol between the ages 16 to 43, and also those who consistently engaged in binge-drinking in that period, showed higher levels of glucose in their blood than women who drank less amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relationship was not affected by whether or not a woman had a high body mass index (BMI) or high blood pressure, which in turn were the two main factors affecting high blood-sugar levels for men. Furthermore, exercise and smoking habits, both in adolescence and in adulthood, had no effect on blood-sugar levels for either men or women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal design of this study made it possible to explore the relationships between drinking behavior and diabetes in a way that was previously not possible, and it highlights the effects of chronic drinking on health. The study has its caveats: for example, it is difficult to say exactly why heavy drinking promotes higher blood-glucose levels without gathering additional data about liver function, insulin resistance or other related factors. Furthermore, the researcher had to estimate the likely alcohol consumption per year, from the interviews that were conducted every 3 to 13 years, which might have led to an over- or underestimation of the true alcohol intake over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the results presented by Nygren and her colleagues demonstrated that alcohol consumption patterns formed in adolescence may persist into later life and can thus affect the susceptibility for diseases such as diabetes from an early age on. Interventions to reduce binge-drinking and high alcohol consumption are beneficial across all ages but may be especially effective if targeted at young women, to prevent the development of a habit of heavy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading with a young child is important for their language development and early literacy skills. But does it matter if you read from an electronic book (e-book) or traditional print? As any parent knows, toddlers are generally keen on screens. So the finding, from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00677/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_275249_69_Psycho_20170518_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, that very young children enjoy e-books more than print picture books, may not come as a huge surprise – but these additional findings might: both parents and toddlers behaved differently when reading electronic vs. print picture books. And the toddlers who read the e-books learned more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25175&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of children aged three and up have suggested that e-books – with their extra features, such as built-in dictionaries and animations of story events – may have advantages over print. A recent meta-analysis found that e-books support story comprehension and vocabulary gains beyond that provided by print books, for example. But there’s also work suggesting that children sometimes invest less mental effort in learning from iPads than print, and that parents talk less about content when sharing an e-book – and there’s been very little research at all in this area on children under two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new research, Gabrielle Strouse at the University of South Dakota, US, and Patricia Ganea at the University of Toronto, Canada, videoed 102 toddlers aged 17-26 months reading with one of their parents. Each parent-child pair was randomly assigned to read either two 10-page commercially-available educational e-books (one about farm animals, the other about wild animals; both downloaded to a handheld device) or two print books with the same content. While the parent read the words in the print books aloud, the e-books had an automatic voiceover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they analysed the videos later, Strouse and Ganea found that parents who read the print books pointed more frequently to pages than parents who read the e-books. But the opposite was true for the children. Toddlers who read the e-books also commented more on the content and turned more pages by themselves. “Taken together, it appeared that children were very communicative regarding the electronic books, indicating an interest in their content and a desire to share this interest,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the reading sessions, the researchers had asked the parents to list how many of the animal names in both books their child already knew and understood. After the sessions, the children who’d read the e-books were better at identifying previously unfamiliar animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toddlers who read ebooks were also rated as being more engaged, as paying more attention, and as enjoying the experience more. And according to the analysis, it was “availability for reading” – being “present” and engaged – that was associated with the superior learning results for e-books vs. print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important point to note is that the e-books were simple. While they included background music, animation and sound effects, there were no “hotspots” – parts of the screen that, when tapped, trigger extra features, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, while extra e-book enhancements can certainly engage a child, there’s research in older children finding that they don’t always lead to improved learning. “Bells and whistles in electronic books can be designed in many ways that may increase children’s participation with them, but if these features do not draw attention to the educational content they may not serve as a supportive feature,” Strouse and Ganea warned in their paper, before concluding: “Much more work is needed to determine the potential benefits and hazards of new media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00677/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_275249_69_Psycho_20170518_arts_A&quot;&gt;Parent–Toddler Behavior and Language Differ When Reading Electronic and Print Picture Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in April, Springer retracted a record number 107 papers from Tumor Biology after uncovering evidence they were subject to fake peer reviews. But it appears that the Tumor Biology sweep was only part of the story. During the Tumor Biology investigation, Springer found evidence that the “peer review process was compromised” in a dozen papers […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfaction in mammals is a dynamic process driven by the inhalation of air
through the nasal cavity. Inhalation determines the temporal structure of
sensory neuron responses and shapes the neural dynamics underlying central
olfactory processing. Inhalation-linked bursts of activity among olfactory bulb
(OB) output neurons [mitral/tufted cells (MCs)] are temporally transformed
relative to those of sensory neurons. We investigated how OB circuits shape
inhalation-driven dynamics in MCs using a modeling approach that was highly
constrained by experimental results. First, we constructed models of canonical
OB circuits that included mono- and disynaptic feedforward excitation,
recurrent inhibition and feedforward inhibition of the MC. We then used
experimental data to drive inputs to the models and to tune parameters; inputs
were derived from sensory neuron responses during natural odorant sampling
(sniffing) in awake rats, and model output was compared with recordings of MC
responses to odorants sampled with the same sniff waveforms. This approach
allowed us to identify OB circuit features underlying the temporal
transformation of sensory inputs into inhalation-linked patterns of MC spike
output. We found that realistic input-output transformations can be achieved
independently by multiple circuits, including feedforward inhibition with slow
onset and decay kinetics and parallel feedforward MC excitation mediated by
external tufted cells. We also found that recurrent and feedforward inhibition
had differential impacts on MC firing rates and on inhalation-linked response
dynamics. These results highlight the importance of investigating neural
circuits in a naturalistic context and provide a framework for further
explorations of signal processing by OB networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one quality you absolutely want in a leader, it’s surely charisma. Celebrated leaders are invariably associated with this magic word, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1099-1379(200011)21:7%2525253C747::AID-JOB46%2525253E3.0.CO%253B2-J/abstract&quot;&gt;evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; charismatic people inspire more trust, commitment, and results from their followers. But across a number of other supposedly virtuous traits, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/17/having-strong-political-skills-can-be-a-handicap-in-the-workplace/&quot;&gt;political ability&lt;/a&gt; or assertiveness (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1887/ames_assertiveness_jpsp.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;), researchers are starting to realise that it’s possible to have “too much of a good thing.” Could charisma fall in that category? That’s the suggestion of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-23344-001/&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25148&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jasmine Vergauwe of the University of Ghent and her collaborators began by investigating a mainly American sample, employees in an international aerospace company. They focused on around 300 leaders (supervisors to general managers), two-thirds of them male and typically in their late 40s, who rated themselves on a personality measure focused on capturing charismatic leader qualities. They then rated their own effectiveness as leaders, and the more charismatic they rated themselves, the more effective they believed they were. But when other members of the organisation rated the same leaders, a different picture emerged. Each group – peers, subordinates and managers – described the same pattern: both low-charisma and high-charisma leaders were seen as less effective than those in between. Charisma was useful up to a point, but beyond that, it was counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If large doses of charisma are toxic, maybe we can understand why by examining the ingredient list. In the earlier surveys, Vergauwe’s team had used a measure of charismatic personality composed of four aspects: boldness, colour, imagination and mischief. Each has obvious leadership benefits but could also create problems: for example, &lt;i&gt;colourful&lt;/i&gt; leaders are extraverted and inspirational, but prefer being in the spotlight to toiling away invisibly on lower-key issues. Similarly, &lt;i&gt;imaginative&lt;/i&gt; leaders are visionary and creative, but can tend towards the eccentric and concerning themselves only with the big picture. Vergauwe noted that these negative aspects looked like they could interfere with specific types of leadership activity, and in a second study, the team put this to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly three hundred business leaders from 23 different countries, together with thousands of co-workers, went through a similar rating process as in the first study. This time, however, the measures of leadership effectiveness were more fine-grained, including questions about how the leader treats their staff and how competent they are at organisational strategy and tactics. One hypothesis, that highly charismatic leaders would differ in their treatment of others compared with less charismatic leaders, was not borne out; the researchers thought high charisma would be associated with being more forceful and less enabling, but no such differences emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it came to where leaders were putting their focus, the data showed a clear effect. Low-charisma leaders were seen by their staff and colleagues as having too little strategic nous, but no problems with their tactical ability (they could handle the detail but struggled with the big picture). High-charisma leaders, meanwhile, were seen as strategically optimal, but tactically weak (strong on the big picture but weak on detail). Meanwhile, moderate-charisma leaders tended to be viewed as fairly optimal for both strategic and tactical aspects of the job. This suggests that the problem for the highly charismatic isn’t that they are doing too much of anything – over-strategising to the point that it becomes a detriment, for instance – but that they are neglecting other aspects of leadership along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their search for leaders, organisations are desperate to discover a method, based on particular traits, that ensures they will always strike gold. But wherever they mine, seams that initially appear perfect produce mixed yields, sometimes valuable, sometimes not. Organisations that are mindful of that will do just fine; for instance, knowing that specific blind spots may emerge for charismatic people, you can raise their awareness and develop them into well-balanced leaders. But recruiters who assume that any single quality is pure gold, not realising that under a different light there are copper pyrites in there too, … well, then they’re the fools. And no amount of charismatic figures on their list will make it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Fetal and infant exposure to severe Chinese famine increases the risk of adult dyslipidemia</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/14/fetal-infant-exposure-to-severe-chinese-famine-increases-risk-of-adult-dyslipidemia/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/famine-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dyslipdemia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is one of the leading causes of death in developing and developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the Chinese national data, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 26.7% among workers aged 18-59 years in 2012, and was 33.5% among Chinese aged greater than 45-years-old. The emerging pandemic was partially caused by population growth, rapidly aging and changes of diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, recent studies indicated that the early life famine exposure might also increase the later susceptibility to some common chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famine exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the radical collectivization movement and inclement climate conditions, almost the entirety of Mainland China suffered from extreme food shortage during 1959-1961. The famine severity was different across provinces due to variation of climate, population density, and policies regarding shortage of foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provinces with excess mortality ≥ 50% were defined as severe famine affected areas; other provinces were defined as less severely affected areas. For example, the excess mortality of Anhui province was the highest, up to 474.9%; Tianjin province was lowest, at only 14.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the dyslipidemia prevalence of the non-exposed cohort, fetal stage, infant stage, and preschool stage-exposed cohorts in adulthood were 15.7%, 23.1%, 22.0%, and 18.6%, respectively. Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risks of dyslipidemia in fetal and infant stage-exposed cohorts were significantly higher than the non-exposed cohort after adjusting for gender and current family economic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, following gender stratification, we found that fetal, infant, and preschool stage exposure to severe famine aggravated the risk of dyslipidemia only in female adults; a similar association was not observed for male adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender bias? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We speculated that this gender-specific effect might be associated with the hypothesis that parents in China traditionally prefer boys to girls. In China, male children took precedence over females due to gender bias, and thus they may potentially be sufficiently nourished during the famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, survivor bias may be another reason to interpret the lack of “effect” on males. Prenatal Males were more vulnerable than females to both short and long term effects of famine and die at higher rates. Thus, male survivors could be healthier than female survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explaining the link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms might explain the link in early-life famine exposure and elevated dyslipidemia risk in later life. Firstly, severe maternal under-nutrition during pregnancy could alter the synthesis of cholesterol, increasing the plasma concentration; this has been shown in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, individuals who suffered from severe intrauterine malnutrition are more likely to consume a high-fat diet in adulthood while reducing the level of physical activity, thereby increasing atherogenic lipid profile, as observed by a Dutch famine study. In the present study, we did not explore the correlation between famine exposure and dietary and physical behavior due to lack of relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6592&quot;&gt;Elmar et al.&lt;/a&gt; comprehensively assessed the associations of prenatal malnutrition and differentially methylated regions (P-DMRs) in humans and found that &lt;em&gt;CPTIA&lt;/em&gt; was involved in fatty acid oxidation and &lt;em&gt;KLF13&lt;/em&gt; involved in cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methylation level as one of the principal components of epigenetics, could effectively adjust the expression level of the gene. In addition, epigenetic plasticity may play an important role in the postnatal period and result in “metabolic imprinting” which could be another biological mechanism beneath the association of early life malnutrition with metabolic diseases in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite China now being food secure, many people are still exposed to food shortages in low-income and middle-income countries. Hence many children are still at short term risk of malnutrition associated mortality and morbidity, but also at long-term risk of adult non-communicable diseases. The heavily short and long-term adverse effects from severe food shortage ask us to implement the urgent interventions to lower their occurrence or improve their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Selective depletion of uropathogenic E. coli from the gut by a FimH antagonist</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/u9I9pzzrNto/nature22972</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) affect 150 million people annually. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, 30–50% of patients experience recurrent UTIs. In addition, the growing prevalence of UPEC that are resistant to last-line antibiotic treatments, and more recently to carbapenems and colistin, make UTI a prime example of the antibiotic-resistance crisis and emphasize the need for new approaches to treat and prevent bacterial infections. UPEC strains establish reservoirs in the gut from which they are shed in the faeces, and can colonize the periurethral area or vagina and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the urinary tract, where they cause UTIs. UPEC isolates encode up to 16 distinct chaperone-usher pathway pili, and each pilus type may enable colonization of a habitat in the host or environment. For example, the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH binds mannose on the bladder surface, and mediates colonization of the bladder. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying UPEC persistence in the gut. Here, using a mouse model, we show that F17-like and type 1 pili promote intestinal colonization and show distinct binding to epithelial cells distributed along colonic crypts. Phylogenomic and structural analyses reveal that F17-like pili are closely related to pilus types carried by intestinal pathogens, but are restricted to extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Moreover, we show that targeting FimH with M4284, a high-affinity inhibitory mannoside, reduces intestinal colonization of genetically diverse UPEC isolates, while simultaneously treating UTI, without notably disrupting the structural configuration of the gut microbiota. By selectively depleting intestinal UPEC reservoirs, mannosides could markedly reduce the rate of UTIs and recurrent UTIs.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: PTEN counteracts FBXL2 to promote IP3R3- and Ca2+-mediated apoptosis limiting tumour growth</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/70QGnG6QlfA/nature22965</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In response to environmental cues that promote IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) generation, IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the endoplasmic reticulum allow the ‘quasisynaptical’ feeding of calcium to the mitochondria to promote oxidative phosphorylation. However, persistent Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and consequent apoptosis. Among the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears to be the major player in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXL2 (the receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-, p97- and proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and sensitization to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and syndromes that predispose individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is accelerated in Pten−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. Reconstitution of PTEN-null cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein levels directly correlate in human prostate cancer. Both in cell culture and xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant sensitizes tumour cells with low or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, which is based on the ability of photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity after irradiation with visible light. Similarly, disruption of FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to photodynamic therapy. In summary, we identify a novel molecular mechanism that limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to prevent cell death. Notably, we provide proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers represents a valid therapeutic strategy.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Microglia-dependent synapse loss in type I interferon-mediated lupus</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody deposition in tissues such as kidney, skin and lungs. Notably, up to 75% of patients with SLE experience neuropsychiatric symptoms that range from anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment to seizures and, in rare cases, psychosis—collectively this is referred to as central nervous system (CNS) lupus. In some cases, certain autoantibodies, such as anti-NMDAR or anti-phospholipid antibodies, promote CNS lupus. However, in most patients, the mechanisms that underlie these symptoms are unknown. CNS lupus typically presents at lupus diagnosis or within the first year, suggesting that early factors contributing to peripheral autoimmunity may promote CNS lupus symptoms. Here we report behavioural phenotypes and synapse loss in lupus-prone mice that are prevented by blocking type I interferon (IFN) signalling. Furthermore, we show that type I IFN stimulates microglia to become reactive and engulf neuronal and synaptic material in lupus-prone mice. These findings and our observation of increased type I IFN signalling in post-mortem hippocampal brain sections from patients with SLE may instruct the evaluation of ongoing clinical trials of anifrolumab, a type I IFN-receptor antagonist. Moreover, identification of IFN-driven microglia-dependent synapse loss, along with microglia transcriptome data, connects CNS lupus with other CNS diseases and provides an explanation for the neurological symptoms observed in some patients with SLE.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: ERF mutations reveal a balance of ETS factors controlling prostate oncogenesis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/bqVQrKGjtkY/nature22820</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Half of all prostate cancers are caused by the TMPRSS2–ERG gene-fusion, which enables androgens to drive expression of the normally silent E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG in prostate cells. Recent genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2–ERG-positive prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the oncogenicity of ERG is mediated, in part, by competition with ERF and they raise the larger question of whether other gain-of-function oncogenic transcription factors might also inactivate endogenous tumour suppressors.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Histone deacetylase 3 prepares brown adipose tissue for acute thermogenic challenge</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8bYlgdJYHvU/nature22819</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Brown adipose tissue is a thermogenic organ that dissipates chemical energy as heat to protect animals against hypothermia and to counteract metabolic disease. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that determine the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue before environmental cold are unknown. Here we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required to activate brown adipose tissue enhancers to ensure thermogenic aptitude. Mice with brown adipose tissue-specific genetic ablation of HDAC3 become severely hypothermic and succumb to acute cold exposure. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is nearly absent in brown adipose tissue lacking HDAC3, and there is also marked downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes resulting in diminished mitochondrial respiration. Remarkably, although HDAC3 acts canonically as a transcriptional corepressor, it functions as a coactivator of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in brown adipose tissue. HDAC3 coactivation of ERRα is mediated by deacetylation of PGC-1α and is required for the transcription of Ucp1, Ppargc1a (encoding PGC-1α), and oxidative phosphorylation genes. Importantly, HDAC3 promotes the basal transcription of these genes independently of adrenergic stimulation. Thus, HDAC3 uniquely primes Ucp1 and the thermogenic transcriptional program to maintain a critical capacity for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue that can be rapidly engaged upon exposure to dangerously cold temperature.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: BAP1 regulates IP3R3-mediated Ca2+ flux to mitochondria suppressing cell transformation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/01bqHgF1tQM/nature22798</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a potent tumour suppressor gene that modulates environmental carcinogenesis. All carriers of inherited heterozygous germline BAP1-inactivating mutations (BAP1+/−) developed one and often several BAP1−/− malignancies in their lifetime, mostly malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and so on. Moreover, BAP1-acquired biallelic mutations are frequent in human cancers. BAP1 tumour suppressor activity has been attributed to its nuclear localization, where it helps to maintain genome integrity. The possible activity of BAP1 in the cytoplasm is unknown. Cells with reduced levels of BAP1 exhibit chromosomal abnormalities and decreased DNA repair by homologous recombination, indicating that BAP1 dosage is critical. Cells with extensive DNA damage should die and not grow into malignancies. Here we discover that BAP1 localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, it binds, deubiquitylates, and stabilizes type 3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R3), modulating calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and mitochondria, promoting apoptosis. Reduced levels of BAP1 in BAP1+/− carriers cause reduction both of IP3R3 levels and of Ca2+ flux, preventing BAP1+/− cells that accumulate DNA damage from executing apoptosis. A higher fraction of cells exposed to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, or to asbestos, survive genotoxic stress, resulting in a higher rate of cellular transformation. We propose that the high incidence of cancers in BAP1+/− carriers results from the combined reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of BAP1. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the powerful ability of BAP1 to regulate gene–environment interaction in human carcinogenesis.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Conventional two-dimensional differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. Three-dimensional organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal liver cells. We use a receptor–ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals interlineage communication regulating organoid development, and illuminates previously inaccessible aspects of human liver development.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 During gestation the developing human fetus is exposed to a diverse range of potentially immune-stimulatory molecules including semi-allogeneic antigens from maternal cells, substances from ingested amniotic fluid, food antigens, and microbes. Yet the capacity of the fetal immune system, including antigen-presenting cells, to detect and respond to such stimuli remains unclear. In particular, dendritic cells, which are crucial for effective immunity and tolerance, remain poorly characterized in the developing fetus. Here we show that subsets of antigen-presenting cells can be identified in fetal tissues and are related to adult populations of antigen-presenting cells. Similar to adult dendritic cells, fetal dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes and respond to toll-like receptor ligation; however, they differ markedly in their response to allogeneic antigens, strongly promoting regulatory T-cell induction and inhibiting T-cell tumour-necrosis factor-α production through arginase-2 activity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of dendritic cells within the developing fetus and indicate that they mediate homeostatic immune-suppressive responses during gestation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Physiological needs bias perception and attention to relevant sensory cues. This process is ‘hijacked’ by drug addiction, causing cue-induced cravings and relapse. Similarly, its dysregulation contributes to failed diets, obesity, and eating disorders. Neuroimaging studies in humans have implicated insular cortex in these phenomena. However, it remains unclear how ‘cognitive’ cortical representations of motivationally relevant cues are biased by subcortical circuits that drive specific motivational states. Here we develop a microprism-based cellular imaging approach to monitor visual cue responses in the insular cortex of behaving mice across hunger states. Insular cortex neurons demonstrate food-cue-biased responses that are abolished during satiety. Unexpectedly, while multiple satiety-related visceral signals converge in insular cortex, chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic ‘hunger neurons’ (expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP)) bypasses these signals to restore hunger-like response patterns in insular cortex. Circuit mapping and pathway-specific manipulations uncover a pathway from AgRP neurons to insular cortex via the paraventricular thalamus and basolateral amygdala. These results reveal a neural basis for state-specific biased processing of motivationally relevant cues.

The new technique, called temporal interference (TI) stimulation, is said to be able to reach structures deep inside the brain, using nothing more than scalp electrodes.

Currently, the only way to stimulate deep brain structures is by implanting electrodes (wires) into the brain - which is an expensive and potentially dangerous surgical procedure. TI promises to make deep brain stim</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heralded as a revolution in mental health care – a cost-effective way to deliver evidence-based psychological help to large numbers – low-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended by NICE, the independent health advisory body in England and Wales, for mild to moderate depression and anxiety and is a key part of the “Improving Access to Psychological Therapies” programme in those countries. Prior studies into its effectiveness have been promising. However, little research has looked at whether the benefits last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300840?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; has done that, following a cohort of people with depression and anxiety over time. Disappointingly, the team led by Shehzad Ali at the University of York, found that after completing low-intensity CBT, more than one in two service users had relapsed within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24965&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity CBT is based on the same principles as full or high-intensity CBT – clients reflect on and strive to change their habits of thought that could be contributing to their mental distress, and they also learn coping strategies and other skills. However, it’s delivered in such a way as to reduce the need for extended one-on-one time with a qualified psychotherapist. It typically incorporates self-help books and internet exercises, usually completed under the guidance of a “well-being practitioner” or coach who is trained to follow a highly structured programme rather than having any formal psychotherapy training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the longer term outcomes for low-intensity CBT, Ali and his colleagues recruited hundreds of people at a primary care service in West Yorkshire in England. The participants were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, or both, and had enrolled in low-intensity CBT. Some dropped out prematurely and were not included in further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For current purposes, the researchers were interested in the 439 participants who had recovered during their low-intensity CBT (improvements in their symptoms meant they no longer met the diagnosis for anxiety or depression) and who had ended their course of treatment in agreement with their practitioner or coach – on average this was after seven contacts with their practitioner, including the initial assessment. For comparison, high-intensity CBT with a psychotherapist can last up to 20 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing their low-intensity CBT, the recovered participants (average age 41, 60 per cent were female, over 90 per cent were white British) completed monthly questionnaires that measured their levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. As time went on, an increasing proportion of the participants showed evidence of having relapsed – that is, their symptoms had deteriorated to a point that suggested they would likely be diagnosed as having anxiety or depression again. By twelve months after the end of their low-intensity CBT, nearly 53 per cent had relapsed; half of these relapses had occurred within two months, 80 per cent within six months (for comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563164&quot;&gt;a meta-analysis of high-intensity CBT&lt;/a&gt; found that 29 per cent of recovered clients with depression had relapsed within 12 months, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15809409/&quot;&gt;a better outcome than for patients who stop taking anti-depressants&lt;/a&gt;) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to predict who is likely to relapse? In the current study, recovered participants who still showed some symptoms of depression at the end of their course of low-intensity CBT (but not enough to justify a diagnosis) were far more likely to relapse over the ensuing year. Residual anxiety symptoms were not predictive in this way. The finding for residual depression symptoms suggests many low-intensity CBT users would benefit from some kind of on-going after care, such as booster sessions or other lower-intensity support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems hasty to consider patients ‘recovered’ at the point of discharge without assessing full remission symptoms over a longer period,” Ali and his colleagues concluded. “It could be argued that many of the relapse cases in this study actually had partial (rather than full) remission at the time of treatment completion, and thus never actually ‘recovered'”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study will fuel the fears of some experts that low-intensity CBT is a form of false economising. It may be quick and cheap but the results suggest that many people are being sent on their way before they are fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One counter to that argument is that prior to the roll out of low-intensity CBT, many of the kinds of people who took part in this research (i.e. people with mild to moderate mental health problems) would have received no treatment at all or given powerful drugs. They might have spent months or years on a waiting list for a psychotherapist, during which time their problems may well have worsened. Another point to bear in mind was that this research was conducted in just one service in England, and more research is needed in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is clear that relapse prevention is an overlooked aspect of routine stepped care in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services and an important area for further policy and research developments,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300840?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;How durable is the effect of low intensity CBT for depression and anxiety? Remission and relapse in a longitudinal cohort study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Oscillatory Thoughts: The Prodigy Effect</title>
	<link>http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/08/the-prodigy-effect.html</link>
	<content:encoded>This post might turn into a collaborative research project. If you're a data person, or an experimental psychologist interested in this, get in touch. I'd love to see if we can't formalize this idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/mar/05/heimlich/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent (excellent) Radiolab episode&lt;/a&gt; about the strange, unproven ideas of Henry Heimlich (of Heimlich maneuver fame)--along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/?1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this Atlantic article&lt;/a&gt; about Linus Pauling's ideas about vitamin mega-dosing as a cancer cure--got me thinking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobel Disease&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and the effect that early successes could have on people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to that link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The Nobel disease is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which Nobel Prize-winning scientists endorse or perform &quot;research&quot; in pseudoscientific areas in their later years. In reality, this &quot;disease&quot; most likely demonstrates that even the most brilliant people are not immune to crank ideas and belief in such ideas will persist to some degree even among Nobelists. It also makes for a convenient argument from authority for lesser cranks, because if a Nobel Prize-winning scientist says it, it must be true!&lt;/blockquote&gt;As we know, we humans are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;susceptible to misconceptions, logical fallacies, and biases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if people who are &lt;i&gt;exceptionally&lt;/i&gt; successful from an early age are biased into thinking that they're less fallible, at the exclusion of taking advice and/or criticism, while simultaneously their &lt;i&gt;incredible&lt;/i&gt; success paralyzes other people from offering criticism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put that another way, what I'm calling the &quot;Prodigy Effect&quot; is a two-way cognitive bias wherein one gives their own innate abilities undue positive weight with regards to their early success in a domain (business, art, science, etc.) which at the same time makes others reluctant to offer criticism. This seems like a mix of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-hand_fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hot-hand fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, some kind of &quot;beginner's luck&quot; bias, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gambler's fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, with a dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;self-serving bias&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spiral of silence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot-hand fallacy was made famous by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4788541579061542217&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 1985 &lt;i&gt;Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky, &quot;The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences&quot;. Basically, this fallacy is one wherein someone who has had an early success at something believes they have a greater chance of success at future tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that came to mind about this idea was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/m-night-shymalan-movies-keep-getting-worse-2013-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt; about M. Night Shyamalan's moving ratings over time. Each successive movie is essentially rated more poorly than the last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or this review of &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace &lt;/i&gt;(jump to 4:55) about people not calling out George Lucas on some bad ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Shyamalan and Lucas had &lt;i&gt;crazy&lt;/i&gt; successes with &lt;i&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: A New Hope&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. But the subsequent movies that they directed were widely regarded as pretty awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, these are anecdotes, and what counts is data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first idea was to take a look at the list of those who have fallen prey to the &quot;Nobel Disease&quot; and to look at their ages compared to the average age of other Nobelists. The hypothesis is that those who are &quot;Nobel Diseased&quot; would be, on average, much younger when they won their first Nobel than the average Nobelist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize website has an API&lt;/a&gt; that provides these data, which I've cleaned and organized &lt;a href=&quot;http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/publications/nobel_disease.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That file also includes the MATLAB script I used to analyze the data. For people with multiple Nobel prizes, I took their age at their first win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that those 14 people who are classified as having the &quot;Nobel Disease&quot; were, on average, &lt;i&gt;8.4 years younger &lt;/i&gt;when they won their first Nobel Prize compared to &quot;normal&quot; Nobelists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s1600/nobel_disease.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s320/nobel_disease.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is significant using a two-way &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011) and using resampling methods (1000 surrogate group reassignments, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd love to do the same analysis on the ratings difference between a director's first film and subsequent films, with the idea that directors who have an early huge hit would then have more poorly-rated future films, but I don't have time to dig into &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Rotten Tomatoes API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hypothesis could also be tested in an experimental psychology setup, though I don't quite have an idea for the experimental design yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, interesting stuff regardless, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to help, let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: left; padding: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ResearchBlogging.org&quot; src=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Cognitive+Psychology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2F0010-0285%2885%2990010-6&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+hot+hand+in+basketball%3A+On+the+misperception+of+random+sequences&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=1985&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=T+Gilovich%2C+R+Vallone%2C+A+Tversky&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CSocial+Science&quot;&gt;T Gilovich, R Vallone, A Tversky (1985).

	<title>Brain Blogger: Best and Worst of Neuroscience and Neurology – May 2017</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/06/12/best-and-worst-of-neuroscience-and-neurology-may-2017/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is genetic basis of our intelligence? How to stimulate deep areas of the brain? How to prevent Alzheimer’s disease?  How to slash the cost of treatment of multiple sclerosis? These are some of the questions highlighted in this monthly review of research literature. As usual, while we answer some questions, research studies also dispel some myths and assumption. Whether positive or negative,  the findings always help us to advance further our knowledge of brain and its abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, we marked the birthday of Stanley Prusiner, the discoverer of prions – self-replicating proteins behind many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Recognising the importance of prions finally put the research aimed at finding the cure for these conditions on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New genes for intelligence identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is highly heritable: it is estimated that 80% of our intelligence in adulthood is explained by genetic factors. However, our knowledge of specific genes involved in intelligence is very limited. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3869.html&quot;&gt;New study&lt;/a&gt; published this month and based on the analysis of genetic data from 78,000 individuals reported 52 genes associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/22/is-there-an-association-between-brain-size-and-intelligence/&quot;&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, 40 of which are completely novel. Interestingly, many of these genes are also involved in determining other traits such as obesity, BMI, depressive syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain region responsible for the fear of uncertain future is identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people find it difficult to cope with an uncertain future. Surprisingly, it turned out that this particular behavioural feature closely relates to the size of one specific part of the brain – the striatum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000331.pdf&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a larger striatum is typically seen in people who have troubles dealing with uncertainties.  The study was done on psychologically healthy individuals, but an enlarged striatum has also been reported to be associated with general anxiety disorder and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/07/13/multifaceted-causes-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/&quot;&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;.  Researchers speculate that an enlarged striatum may be linked to a higher risk of developing these disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-invasive method of stimulating deep parts of brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/&quot;&gt;stimulation&lt;/a&gt; of deep parts of the brain has proven to be beneficial in treating a number of brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and depression. However, the approach requires implanting of an electrode directly inside the brain, which involves a risky and costly surgery. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)30584-6.pdf&quot;&gt;new technique &lt;/a&gt;reported this month avoids this problem by using a pair of electrodes located on the surface of the scalp. The method relies on the use of a phenomenon known as temporal interference. This techniques allows the targeted delivery of electrical stimulation to deep areas of brain, such as hippocampus, without stimulating the surface brain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cheap treatment for multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic minocycline, traditionally used as an acne medicine, may provide a safe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608889&quot;&gt;new method &lt;/a&gt;of treating &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/&quot;&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), at a fraction of current cost of treating this disease. This drug was developed over 50 years ago. It attracted the attention of researchers studying MS due to its spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities. Phase III trials demonstrated that minocycline slows the progress of disease in patients diagnosed during the early stages of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA-based vaccine for Alzheimer’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, we still have no single treatment that could cure this condition or stop its progression. An earlier attempt to develop a vaccine preventing the development of Alzheimer’s disease has also failed due to severe side effects. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-017-0257-7&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month reports a new promising DNA-based vaccine that inhibits the accumulation of amyloid proteins in animals and shows no side effects observed in previous trials. It remains to be seen if these effects can be reproduced in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood-brain barrier and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are well known for their positive effects on general health. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/comments/S0896-6273(17)30287-8&quot;&gt;Recent findings&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate that these compounds are critical players in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, the key structure for protecting the brain from various pathogens and toxins. Moreover, researchers demonstrated that permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be regulated by suppressing a protein that transports &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/&quot;&gt;omega-3 acids&lt;/a&gt; to blood vessel cells. Making the barrier more penetrable is advantageous for efficient delivery of drugs when treating patients with various brain disorders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE WORST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No stress relief from high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of cannabis often claim that they use the drug for relaxation and stress relief. More detailed&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(17)30220-X/fulltext&quot;&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; of this effect shows a mixed picture. While experimenting with different doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active substance in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/&quot;&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that small doses of the compound do indeed reduce stress. However, a slightly higher doses (sufficient to produce a mild “high”) produce an opposite effect and increase anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual cortex develops and matures much slower than assumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is traditionally believed that our visual system, including the parts of brain involved in the analysis of visual information, matures within the first few years of life. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2017/05/29/JNEUROSCI.2304-16.2017&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. Visual cortex continues developing till the late 30s – early 40s. The authors of the article speculate that other parts of the brain may also reach maturity much later in life than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation  does not enhance cognitive training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation () is increasingly used as a method of improving learning abilities. The technique relies on passing weak electric impulses to the brain via electrodes attached to the scalp. Despite the growing popularity of this technique, the evidence in support of its advantages are very limited. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month casts further doubt on any benefits provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/&quot;&gt;tDCS&lt;/a&gt;. The author reported no improvements of working memory in a large group of subjects using this method, as compared to controls. Furthermore, the analysis of the existing literature on the subject also does not provide any meaningful support to the method. Clearly, further research on tDCS should be done to confirm or rule out the existence of its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sense of smell in humans is a misconception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superiority of animals sense of smell compared to humans appears to be obvious to most people. After all, we do rely on a dog’s sense of smell for hunting, and it is well known how quickly sharks can detect the slightest smell of blood. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; attempts to dispel the view that the human ability to detect smells is as bad as we are used to thinking. The number of brain cells involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/03/smell-your-age/&quot;&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; detection in humans is almost the same as in animals, and it is estimated that we can distinguish up to one trillion of different odors. We may lack the degree of specialization demonstrated by many animals in interpreting the information obtained through olfactory system, but the human ability to recognize smells is definitely much stronger than we are accustomed to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women are not better than men at face recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that women are better  at recognizing and reading faces and correctly interpreting facial expressions. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eneuro.org/content/early/2017/04/26/ENEURO.0104-17.2017&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this month casts serious doubts on this assumption. Using a series of tests, scientists demonstrated that no detectable difference in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/&quot;&gt;facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; exists between two genders. Importantly, the neuroimaging of the areas of brain known to be involved in face recognition has shown identical neural activity in both men and women when they were watching a video clip featuring multiple familiar and non-familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;
