&lt;p&gt;For decades, linguists have debated the extent to which language influences the way we think. While the more extreme theories that language &lt;i&gt;determines&lt;/i&gt; what we can and can’t think about have fallen out of favour, there is still considerable evidence that the languages we speak shape the way we see the world in more subtle ways.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, people are better at perceiving the difference between light and dark blue &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/&quot;&gt;if they have dedicated words for those colours&lt;/a&gt; (like in Russian) than if they don’t (like in English). But it turns out it’s not just the words that we use: the way in which a language is structured – its syntax – is also important. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37654-9&quot;&gt;In a recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, Federica Amici and colleagues show that the word order of a language predicts how good its speakers are at remembering the first or last parts of a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team conducted memory tasks with speakers of eight different languages around the world. Four of the languages were what’s known as right-branching – Ndonga, Khmer, Thai and Italian – and four were left-branching – Japanese, Korean, Khoekhoe and Sidaama. They included 24-30 speakers of each language, and tested them in their local area, with the help of a translator where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a right-branching language, the most important part of a phrase, known as the “head”, comes first, followed by words that give more information about that word. So in the phrase “The tiger who came to tea”, the head ‘tiger’ is at the beginning of the sentence, followed by words that reveal more about him (i.e. that he came to tea).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A left-branching language is the opposite: the extra information comes first, and the head is at the end of the sentence. The same phrase in a left-branching language would be something like “who came to tea, the tiger”. (English is mainly right-branching, but has some left-branching tendencies: we put adjectives &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the noun that they modify, as in “the hungry tiger”, rather than “the tiger hungry”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In right-branching languages, the meaning of a sentence is clear from the start because the head is encountered immediately. But in left-branching languages, speakers need to keep a lot of information in mind before they get to the important part of the sentence that clarifies what it’s all about. So the researchers wondered whether speakers of left-branching languages would be generally better at remembering the early parts of lists of stimuli.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants completed three tests designed to tap into working memory, which involves holding information in mind while also processing other information – a key skill in language. For each test, they viewed a sequence of pictures (or some other visual sequence) while simultaneously completing a second distracting task like performing mental arithmetic or judging whether an image was symmetrical. At the end of each series they had to recall the sequence they’d seen in the correct order. These sequences varied across tests and included pictures of animals and objects, different numbers of blue circles, and red squares in a series of grids.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then compared how well the speakers of the two kinds of language remembered stimuli from the first and second halves of the sequences. As they predicted, left-branching speakers were better at recalling the first half of lists than right-branching speakers, and worse at recalling the second half.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show how the languages we speak can have fairly broad influences on cognition, say the authors. “Specific characteristics of a language appear to predict not only the way we perceive and conceptualize the world,” they write, “but also the way we process, store and retrieve information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also demonstrates how differences in culture and language can bias findings in psychology. For example, based almost entirely on Western participants, memory researchers have found that people tend to recall the first and last parts of lists better than the middle parts – phenomena referred to as the “primacy” and “recency” effects –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;which have long been considered a fundamental aspect of how memory works. It is clear from this new study that the language participants speak could have a significant impact on these kinds of results, potentially challenging whether human memory always works that way.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, the study remains preliminary. The overall differences in memory between left- and right-branching languages appear fairly small, and the eight languages the authors studied are just a tiny fraction of the more than 7,000 spoken around the world. Whether the results will be replicated in a larger sample remains to be seen.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37654-9&quot;&gt;The word order of languages predicts native speakers’ working memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re planning to run a marathon, and you have a target time in mind. Or you’re on a weight- loss diet, and your aim is to lose six kilos in six weeks. Or, there’s an exam coming up, and you want to score above 75 per cent. These are all individual goal pursuits. In theory, you’re not in direct competition with anybody else, though of course if you’re part of a running club, or a weight loss group, or an undergraduate class, you will be aware that others around you are striving to achieve their own goals.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of evidence that sharing your own goals and hearing about other people’s can be helpful – in providing mutual encouragement, emotional support and motivation. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspi0000170&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; shows how, in certain circumstances, we can’t help ourselves from competing with others – an effect that can be surprisingly counterproductive.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The findings suggest that when we’re paired with an individual striving for a similar goal and who is similarly able, we begin to view this other person as an opponent – leading us to sabotage their efforts, ultimately to the detriment of our own performance.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pursuing individual goals together with others can at times lead to counter-productive behaviours that not only harm others but also harm oneself,” report Szu-chi Huang at Stanford University, and her colleagues.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36545&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran six experiments. In the first, 200 participants performed rounds of a “word creativity” task, in which they had to make make as many words as possible from a string of letters. They were told they were paired with a “partner” (in fact, a fictional person) who had done slightly better on each round. The participants were given their own personal goal: if they created enough words, they’d be rewarded with a gift card. Another detail is that participants were also able to make the tasks harder or easier for their partner – an opportunity they exploited. Even though their partner’s performance was technically irrelevant to their own goal pursuit, as participants got close to achieving their goal, they tended to choose to make the task harder for their partner – “sabotaging” their partner’s chances. What’s more, after doing this, the participants eased up on their own efforts – they “coasted”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent experiments, some involving other tasks (such as a card game), revealed that the pattern of getting close to a personal goal, sabotaging one’s partner, then coasting, happened whether the participants were led to believe they were slightly ahead of or slightly behind their partner. However, a further study revealed that only participants who believed their sabotaging efforts were successful eased up on their own efforts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers write: “This study thus provided further support that the main purpose of sabotage was to ‘take the opponent down’ a notch; when this positional gain was plausibly realised, people relaxed their effort, even though their sabotaging act did nothing to advance their own individual goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang and her colleagues said their findings suggest that when we perform alongside other people who share similar goals to us, we can’t help ourselves from becoming competitive, which shifts our focus from bettering ourselves to defeating our “opponent”, and then relaxing our own efforts. “This is unexpectedly counterproductive to the attainment of people’s own individual goals,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work contributes to a growing field of research on the social side of goal pursuit. It seems that although we can help each other in the early stages of own parallel journeys, these relationships can become harmful when our goal comes into sight. Being aware of this may help you to understand when to stop paying attention to other people’s progress, and to focus on keeping your own efforts up.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>The Journal of Health Psychology has just published an extraordinary pair of papers that call for a new inquiry into a 30-year old case of probable scientific fraud.

According to Anthony J. Pelosi, author of the main paper, the case was &quot;one of the worst scientific scandals of all time&quot; and yet has never been formally investigated. The journal's editor, David F. Marks, agrees and, in an editorial, also calls for the retraction or correction of up to 61 papers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With the number of referrals to the UK’s only gender identity development service (GIDS, at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust) increasing sharply in recent years – a pattern seemingly mirrored in other European countries and the US (anecdotally, at least — many countries don’t keep comprehensive data the way the UK does) – debate has inevitably intensified over how best to help transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth. As some expert clinicians &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/images/sgd-sgd0000167_tcm7-211986.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;have pointed out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, there has been a tendency for commentators, campaigners and the general public to adopt an oversimplified view in which therapists are seen as fitting one of two categories: those who don’t believe their clients when they say they are trans (and who are therefore condemned by trans advocacy groups for practicing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;conversion therapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), and others who simply accept their clients’ statements about their gender, and who are therefore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;affirming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;affirmative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The clinical reality is more complicated: these days, there is a welcome consensus against actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/psychologists-back-call-end-conversion-therapy&quot;&gt;conversion therapy&lt;/a&gt; — forcing a young person to “go back” to being cisgender — but at the same time responsible clinicians do not simply nod along to what a young person with gender dysphoria says. There are complexities inherent to childhood and adolescent development, and many experts warn it’s important not to accidentally medicalise perfectly normal qualms about growing up, hitting puberty, and being exposed to powerful and often frustratingly restrictive gender roles. Young people present at gender clinics with a wide variety of issues ranging from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/17/most-children-and-teens-with-gender-dysphoria-also-have-multiple-other-psychological-issues/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;comorbid mental-health issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to unexamined trauma, and the process of helping them determine the best path forward, particularly with regard to medical interventions like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/23/systematic-review-puberty-suppressing-drugs-do-not-alleviate-gender-dysphoria/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, is a lot more complicated than making a rapid decision to deny or approve such interventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Indeed, in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://adc.bmj.com/content/103/7/631.full?ijkey=HsMwyZDRtsKu83z&amp;amp;keytype=ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;an open-access practice review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; last year, clinicians at UCL, GIDS and Great Ormond Street Hospital explained that the thorough psychosexual assessment period for such clients “usually takes 6 months or more over a minimum of four to six sessions” and involves a range of psychometric measures and interviews, covering the client’s expectations and understanding of social and physical transition, their mood and emotional functioning. The review adds that, “With the adolescents, there is an in-depth consideration of their sexuality and fertility, and possible preservation approaches are discussed. The attitude of important people in the child’s life towards gender dysphoria needs to be explored and understood.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290&quot;&gt;a study published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Psychology &amp;amp; Sexuality &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;by a pair of Norwegian researchers, Reidar Schel Jessen and Katrina Roen, has explored these complexities from clinical psychologists’ perspective, including what it means to help a young person work through the issues they are facing and to make important decisions about medical treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36483&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For the study, “Five clinical psychologists working with gender non-conforming youth in an interdisciplinary team at a specialized gender identity clinic in Europe participated in interviews.” In reading their work, I was struck repeatedly by how similar their experiences were to what I heard when I spoke with American clinicians for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;an in-depth article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; about transgender youth for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. For example, Jessen and Roen write that “Sometimes the clients themselves want to transition, but sometimes the possibility seems driven by the family or others in the young person’s life, such as school staff.” The pair include a poignant example of this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One young person I worked with […] was referred by school. Biological male, who presented in very… like stereotypically… call it female clothes, like pink and yellow, long hair. Often was read as female, and the school didn’t know what to do with the young person. But when I met the young person, the young person didn’t have any issues with the body or […] developing in a masculine way. So all, so I was kind of again looking at where the stress lies, and it was really in the separation or gender division at school […] and they would ask him to cut his hair short, because he is a boy […] and I think in my report I wrote that… you know, I would really advise you not to address… the pupils as girls and boys, but just call them pupils, students. (Participant C) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I didn’t come across any examples quite so dramatic in my own reporting, but this was a common general storyline: I noted that “Several of the clinicians I spoke with, including Nate Sharon, Laura Edwards-Leeper, and Scott Leibowitz, recounted new patients’ arriving at their clinics, their parents having already developed detailed plans for them to transition. ‘I’ve actually had patients with parents pressuring me to recommend their kids start hormones,’ Sharon said.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Kids who are gender nonconforming often make adults uncomfortable, and in some cases one way adults attempt to dispel this discomfort is to push for transition. “The [clinical psychologist] participants have the impression that sometimes the school or family expect these young boys to transition to girls,” write Jessen and Roen, “because they do not want them to be feminine boys. This illustrates how difficult it can sometimes be to understand which expectations belong to whom, and how gender non-conforming youth can be referred to the clinic by adults who hold the opinion that gender non-conformity is a problem to be addressed clinically.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Similarly, as I wrote in my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Atlantic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;article, clinicians told me about instances in which “the child might be capably navigating a liminal period of gender exploration; it’s the parents who are having trouble not knowing whether their kid is a boy or a girl.” Sure enough, this theme of pressure to choose a gender ‘side,’ too, popped up among the Norwegian clinicians:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Participants were concerned about the possibility that binary gender norms force gender non-conforming youth to become “the opposite gender,” instead of allowing them space to explore their unique gender expression. According to the clinical psychologists interviewed, many clients and families believe that gender is binary, and that there are only two gender identities. This belief does seem to influence clients’ expectations of outcomes, and may encourage them to seek physical treatment at the expense of exploratory work. According to the participants, many clients and their families experience societal and community pressure to conform to gender norms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Exploration and nuance and liminality are key concepts that come up over and over again in interviews with experienced youth TGNC clinicians. But it can be challenging to tell a child who is in distress, or his or her parents, that it’s worth taking a bit more time to explore before proceeding to physical interventions or making other major decisions about transition — perhaps doubly so given the belief in some quarters that “exploration” or “therapy” are near-synonyms for “transphobia” and “conversion therapy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As “Participant B” told the researchers, “Not surprisingly, exploratory strategies can be aggravating to clients and families. We are always very subject to this discourse of the bigot […] this idea of you know transphobia […] so people that are bigoted are very narrow-minded […] this is where then you know the power that we then have starts to really create lots of tension and problems.” That is, at the end of the day, clinicians stand between young people (and their parents) and medical treatments they feel they need, so it’s an understandable reaction for delays caused by responsible, thorough clinical work to be misread as transphobia. This tension was partly what motivated last year’s practice review in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: “Faced with very distressed young people, they [clinicians] may feel under pressure to initiate physical intervention without consultation with psychosocial colleagues,” the review states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If gender clinics in three very different countries with three very different healthcare systems are experiencing the same sorts of scenarios over and over, that’s a signal that everyone should try to better understand what’s going on. Many of the young people mentioned in this study likely will, in the long run, benefit from puberty blockers and hormones. But some won’t — their gender exploration will lead them elsewhere, whether or not they come to identify with their biological sex. It’s important to understand what separates these two groups, and scientists have only barely begun to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290&quot;&gt;Balancing in the margins of gender: exploring psychologists’ meaning-making in their work with gender non-conforming youth seeking puberty suppression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ageing in harmony: why the third act of life should be musical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-macritchie-171595&quot;&gt;Jennifer MacRitchie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/institutions/western-sydney-university-1092&quot;&gt;Western Sydney University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to pick up a musical instrument. In fact, there are many reasons why it’s a great idea, particularly in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We normally hear about reasons to increase music education for children, and for good cause. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/28/3/269&quot;&gt;many cognitive and social benefits&lt;/a&gt; to playing an instrument that aid a child’s development. Consequently, as an older adult, there are long-term effects of having taken part in these musical activities, as it can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463047&quot;&gt;limit cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full&quot;&gt;small amount of training&lt;/a&gt; can have long-lasting effects. But this doesn’t mean that those who have never played an instrument in childhood have missed the boat. The ageing brain is &lt;em&gt;plastic&lt;/em&gt;: that means it is able to learn new things all the time. So, should we consider an increase in music programs for those in the third age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing music as a workout for the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to play a musical instrument is an extremely complex task that involves the coordination of multiple sensory systems within the brain. Many instruments require precise coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands in order to play a musical note. Using the resulting sound as feedback, the brain prepares for the next note and so it continues. The act of music-making is quite a brain workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the motor and auditory parts of the brain is strengthened when physically playing music. This may explain why adults trained to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; certain melodies have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/39/9632.long&quot;&gt;enhanced representation of music&lt;/a&gt; in the brain compared to adults only trained to &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to the same melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As playing music involves many different parts of the brain, even a short-term program for older adult musical novices can lead to generalised improvements for &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00810/full&quot;&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music as a workout for the fingers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to play an instrument such as the piano involves many complex finger sequencing and coordination tasks. As such, it can be a great test-bed for learning to move fingers independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creativity of music and the enjoyment people take in playing is particularly important for rehabilitation, as it encourages sustained practice leading ultimately to higher benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;align-center zoomable&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s thanks to this that piano lessons have been used to successfully retrain hand function for &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00662/full&quot;&gt;patients who have had a stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The immediate auditory feedback from each finger movement is thought to help adults &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721795&quot;&gt;reduce errors in movement&lt;/a&gt; and work towards moving at a more regular pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music training is an excellent environment to train cognitive and motor abilities, both in the contexts of child development and for rehabilitation. The question for older adults is this: can learning a musical instrument not only put the brakes on cognitive and motor decline but actually allow development of new skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1995805/&quot;&gt;improve their motor learning&lt;/a&gt; – that is, they can improve their rate of learning new things – and the best environments for brain training are ones that are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00183/full&quot;&gt;novel and flexible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, many activities can be novel such as juggling or knitting, but the advantages of learning an instrument can be found in the breadth of skills required to play. At Western Sydney University, we are currently investigating how piano training can be used with healthy older adults to improve their general hand function in unrelated daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music for health and wellbeing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the worry is that playing an instrument will be too difficult for older adults to manage. On the contrary, learning to play an instrument can provide a great sense of &lt;a class=&quot;broken_link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/41162324&quot;&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults relish the opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2014.999361&quot;&gt;learn something new&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Cognitive benefits aside, music can also be a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02601370.2014.991951&quot;&gt;social activity for older adults&lt;/a&gt;, facilitating social bonding and decreasing feelings of loneliness or isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music programs are linked to improvements measured in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005138&quot;&gt;markers of the body’s immune system&lt;/a&gt; such as the presence of antibodies and vital signs (heart rate/blood pressure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s suggested that this is a consequence of decreases in stress that can happen when taking part in musical activities. However, further research is needed to determine exactly how this relationship functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s vital to understand how we can aid the current generation of older adults, in terms of both health and personal enjoyment. With the myriad benefits provided by playing a musical instrument, it would seem beneficial to have a wider variety of musical activities on offer to the older generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if the third age wasn’t viewed as a final descent from some mid-life peak, but some new act of life that opens up these opportunities? Perhaps we should give older adults the chance to develop in ways they could never have imagined before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities such as singing in a choir, or playing the piano can provide this opportunity, as well as offering many general benefits to health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether it’s in independent living, retirement or assisted care, let’s make the third act of life a musical one!&lt;img alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.com/content/57799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-hand accounts of what it is like to come close to death often contain the same recurring themes, such as the sense of leaving the body, a review of one’s life, tunnelled vision and a magical sense of reality. Mystics, optimists and people of religious faith interpret this as evidence of an after life. Sceptically minded neuroscientists and psychologists think there may be a more terrestrial neurochemical explanation – that the profound and magical near death experience is caused by the natural release of brain chemicals at or near the end of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, observers have noted the striking similarities between first-hand accounts of near-death experiences and the psychedelic experiences described by people who have taken mind-altering drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had the feeling of floating, still tied to the remains of my heavy body, but floating nonetheless. I rocked and moved, at times as if on a liquid, undulating surface, at other times rising upwards, like a helium-filled flat container.” Excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90988&quot;&gt;Amazing First-time Experience in the K-hole&lt;/a&gt;, published by Phaeton at the Erowid Experience vaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, near death, the brain naturally releases the same psychoactive substances as used by drug takers, or substances that act on the same brain receptors as the drugs. It’s also notable that psychedelic drugs have been taken by the shamans of traditional far-flung cultures through history as a way to, as they see it, visit the after world or speak to the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, however, much of the evidence comparing near death experiences and psychedelic trips has been anecdotal or it’s been based on questionnaire measures that arguably struggle to capture the complexity of these life-changing experiences. Pursuing this line of enquiry with a new approach, an international team of researchers led by Charlotte Martial at the University Hospital of Liège has conducted a deep lexical analysis, comparing 625 written narrative accounts of near death experiences with more than 15,000 written narrative accounts of experiences taking psychoactive drugs (sourced from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://erowid.org/experiences/&quot;&gt;Erowid Experience vaults&lt;/a&gt;), including 165 different substances in 10 drug classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36500&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381001830535X&quot;&gt;published in Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered remarkable similarities between the psychological effects of certain drugs – most of all ketamine, but also notably the serotonergic psychedelic drugs like LSD.  Indeed, the five most common category terms in the narrative accounts of people who’d taken ketamine were the same as the five most common in the near death experience accounts suggesting “shared phenomenological features associated with an altered state of perception of the self and the environment, and a departure from the everyday contents of conscious mentation”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“perception (“face“, “vision“, “saw“), emotion (“fear“), consciousness and cognition (“reality“, “moment“, “universe“, “understand“, “consciousness“, “memory“, “explain“, “learn“), the self and others (“own“, “arm“, “self“, “person“, “human“, “everyone“, “others“) and setting (“door“, “floor“, “inside“, “outside“).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings back up the observations of some of the most famous twentieth-century explorers of the psychedelic world – US psychologist Timothy Leary described trips as “experiments in voluntary death” and the British-born writer and philosopher Gerald Heard said of the psychedelic experience, “that’s what death is going to be like. And, oh, what fun it will be!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an extent the results also support neurochemical accounts of near death experience and especially the controversial proposal that such experiences are caused by the natural release of an as-yet-to-be-discovered ketamine-like drug in the brain (adding plausibility to this account, ketamine is known to act on neural receptors that when activated help to prevent cell death and offer protection from lack of oxygen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note wryly, “unlike other human experiences, dying is difficult to study under controlled laboratory conditions by means of repeated measurements” making it a challenge to investigate near-death experiences experimentally. Although the new research lacks laboratory control, on the plus side the lexical comparison Martial’s team conducted is “massive both in terms of the investigated drugs and the number of associated reports”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the current approach, including a reliance on retrospective reports, often decades old, means, as the researchers put it, that they cannot validate nor refute the neurochemical models of near death experiences. “However,” they add, “our results do provide evidence that ketamine, as well as other psychoactive substances, result in a state phenomenologically similar to that of ‘dying’ … This could have important implications for the pharmaceutical induction of near death experience-like states for scientific purposes, as well as for therapeutic uses in the terminally ill as a means to alleviate death anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: ‘How do we define success?’ – Rethinking failure and success in science</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/rUHttM1W7TA/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/10/FOI-pic-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent of the context, failure is a word that hardly ever leaves us indifferent. Fear of failure is human nature, and it is common that we prefer not to talk about failures if we can avoid it.  When we think about this in a professional context, failure can have clear and immediate ramifications for reputation and career progression and – as with any other professional – researchers are not immune to this fear of failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Part of this approach to failure in research is due to the fact that the research system has traditionally rewarded those who are the first to report a finding over those who are second, and those who report a positive result over those reporting a negative one. However, research generally involves a trial-and-error approach and a plethora of negative findings, or protocols that require troubleshooting before they are fine-tuned. Thus ‘failed’ experiments are common; more so than is often recognized or reported. Much effort and many hours of meticulous research endeavour go unrecognized by the current research assessment frameworks, resulting in a considerable squandering of potentially important research outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Failures: Key to success in science’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;event at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas 2018 aimed to reflect on these considerations in a conversation involving our five panelists and the audience around the notions of failure and success in science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our five panellists kicked off the conversation by giving their perspective on what a successful research career should look like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘How do we define success?’ asked Cathy Sorbara (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Co-chair of CamAWiSE, Cambridge for Women in Science and Engineering),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; maintaining that science does not have a defined endpoint, that collaboration should be a key part of the research process, and that scientists need to think about how they communicate their work, particularly to those unfamiliar with research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Tapoka Mkandawire (PhD candidate, Sanger Institute) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;felt that a key aspect of success is to work on something that you feel passionate about and are keen to share. The audience was interested in the forms that communication of research could take and the panellists noted that communication about research should not be restricted to publications, putting forward ideas around visual formats such as videos. Tapoka noted that her research group has developed a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wormhunters.org/the-comic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;comic book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to more easily describe their work to children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A common theme was that the binary classification of success vs failure is somewhat unfair. Should a result be tagged as failure only because it’s negative and not been published? Fiona Hutton (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Head of STM Open Access Publishing at Cambridge University Press) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;advocated the development of a more collaborative open pathway for research, with more openness at all steps of the process, such as that demonstrated with open lab notebooks, to capture the incremental steps that make up the research process. The sharing of negative and null results should be encouraged as well, as a move away from frameworks that rely on impact factors to assess the quality of research; Fiona mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt; as a good initiative in this space, which is gaining support from institutions and funders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Arthur Smith (Deputy Manager of Scholarly Communication (Open Access)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; University of Cambridge) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and Stephen Eglen (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Reader in Computational Neuroscience, University of Cambridge) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;tackled the challenges with the current research system and acknowledged that this places Principal Investigators (PIs) as the ‘survivors’ of the system, with only a few reaching the top of a steep pyramidal career structure. Stephen stressed that the driving force for getting into research should be a genuine interest in science and not the goal to eventually become a PI. Arthur noted that there are many other career paths available after a PhD and that the skills gained can be used in many other areas, such as the private sector. The training of PhD students should include aspects that go beyond publishing, and should balance this with the development of communication and other skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To round up the discussion we asked panellists to provide recommendations for steps that can help shift perceptions about success and failure in science. Here is what they told us:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;More support for early career researchers, so that they can have an informed, broader view of their career, and of the options after a PhD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Further recognition for the wide range of different roles that scientists play beyond the publication of research findings – for example, peer review activities, mentorship, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Provision of credit for recording and reporting troubleshooting, for any work that may not follow the shape of a conventional publication but which would help others engaged in related research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;More training for those in a research path, to help them develop a variety of transferable skills, and to recognize the value of those skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Increased diversity – higher diversity can only be beneficial in driving change towards how success is defined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Achieving these aims and helping to sway current views about failures in research represents a formidable task, but – much like science itself – change progresses one step at a time and we hope that the engaging conversation at the Festival of Ideas provided one such step to shift how we define “success” in research. As we pursue initiatives towards such change, let’s remind ourselves of Arthur Smith’s definition of success: ‘Success is what makes you happy’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous studies of London’s taxi drivers – showing they have larger hippocampi (the comma-shaped brain structure in the temporal lobes) than controls – have become a staple of undergrad psychology courses and a classic example of how your brain changes according to what you do with it. Many other studies have also implied an association between hippocampal size and navigational ability – for instance, people with Alzheimer’s, who have lost neurons in this brain structure, tend to experience problems finding their way around. For some time, then, an obvious, though tentative, inference has been that better navigators have bigger hippcampi, with London taxi drivers (and their mastery of “the knowledge” of the city’s convoluted streets) and people with Alzheimer’s representing opposite extremes of the spectrum. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/431155v2&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, released as a preprint at &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, raises questions about how far we can safely generalise from the taxi driver and Alzheimer’s-based research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Weisberg and his colleagues tested young adults’ navigation skills and assessed the size of their hippocampi and found the two were not significantly correlated. “The hippocampus plays a crucial role in spatial navigation in humans, but the volume of the hippocampus may not be a biological marker for navigation ability among typical populations,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36461&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ninety participants (average age 23; 54 women) had their brains scanned and they completed a range of psychological questionnaires and tests, including a series of computer-based navigation tasks. These navigation tasks required them to learn the routes between buildings in a virtual environment, to point to the location of various buildings, and to drag and drop buildings in the correct location from memory as a way to test their ability to form a cognitive map of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, the researchers did not find a significant correlation between hippocampi volume and navigation performance, which varied widely across the participants. This was true whether looking at overall hippcampal volume, right hippocampus only or right posterior hippocampus, and remained the case when controlling for differences between participants in other cognitive and demographic factors, such as their mental rotation ability, verbal IQ and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisberg and his team believe there are at least three explanations for their null results. First, perhaps the association between hippocampus size and navigation ability only pertains to extreme groups, like taxi drivers and people with Alzheimer’s, and not to the spread of ability in the general population. Second, perhaps hippocampi volume is too crude a measure, with navigational ability depending more on connectivity within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and other relevant brain areas. Last, maybe  hippocampi volume is associated not so much with navigational skill, but the use of particular navigational strategies (raising questions about what kind of cognitive processes exactly the London taxi drivers’ “knowledge” depends on – for instance, the researchers suggested, perhaps it relies not a cognitive map in the usual sense, but rather “an enormous catalogue of associational data”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the new findings represent much needed research on the neural basis of navigational skills among the healthy general population, they are limited by the study’s use of computer-based navigation tasks – it’s possible the results would have been different using a task in the real world. Also, there was no assessment of brain activity and no measure of the kind of navigational strategies the participants used, so we can’t know what part they may have played in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said future research could address these shortcomings but that as things stand their paper has “implications for the role of the hippocampus in general navigation, and for the extrapolation of findings in expert and impaired groups to healthy, young adults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/431155v2&quot;&gt;Everyday taxi drivers: Do better navigators have larger hippocampi?&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been peer reviewed and the final published version may differ from the version that this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Volker will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding. Volker will focus on temporal coding and summarise John Hopfield's (1995) suggestion how neurons with subthreshold oscillations in their membrane potential could perform scale-invariant temporal encoding of input patterns (and which conditions have to be met for the encoding  to be scale invariant). However, temporal coding is sensitive to noise, and Volker will describe the rank order decoding scheme that was suggested by Simon Thorpe (1998) in order to provide robustness against noise. Furthermore, Volker will outline how Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex could implement a form of rank-order decoding of temporal parallel fibre input patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volker will reference the following papers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/376033a0&quot;&gt;Pattern recognition computation using action potential timing for stimulus representation (J. J. Hopefield, 1995)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Our readers represent a diverse swathe of the scientifically-curious public. We also draw our readers from many fields with an interest in the deep secrets of the brain, from clinicians and neurologists, scientists of all stripes, and researchers in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting that diverse audience, our essays have covered everything from a primer on dopamine, to the limits of what we can learn from neuroscience experiments. There are rich pickings here for anyone curious about the brain: students looking to understand the cutting edge of neuroscience, to those looking for inspiration for the next generation of AI, to researchers at the forefront of neuroscience looking to see how their work fits into a wider context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help you find your way, here is an A to Z guide to the topics, themes, and subjects we’ve published on in The Spike. (We’ll update this page with every new piece, so check back here!) If nothing else, in compiling this list I learnt a few lessons: how little I write about stuff I work on directly in my day-to-day; that we’ve covered a lot about some things (e.g. cortex) and strangely little of others (e.g. learning); and that Frozen was playing so often in our house at one point that it seeped into everything (see entry: &lt;em&gt;Frozen (Disney)&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All pieces are authored by&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@drmdhumphries&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness not only feels bad, experts have characterised it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;a disease&lt;/a&gt; that increases the risk of a range of physical and psychological disorders. Some national prevalence estimates for loneliness are alarming. Although they can be as low as 4.4 per cent (in Azerbaijan), in other countries (such as Denmark) as many as 20 per cent of adults report being either moderately or severely lonely.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no established way of identifying loneliness. Most diagnostic methods treat it as a one-dimensional construct: though it can vary in degrees, someone is either “lonely”, or they’re not. A new approach, outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-018-1597-8&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that loneliness should in fact be divided into three sub-types, two of which are associated with poor mental health.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36467&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Hyland at Trinity College Dublin and colleagues studied a nationally representative sample of 1,839 US adults aged between 18 and 70, all of whom had experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. (This allowed the team to also look for associations between childhood or adult trauma and loneliness.) Most were married or living with a partner.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a six-item scale that measured feelings of “social loneliness” (focusing on perceptions of the &lt;i&gt;quantity&lt;/i&gt; of one’s social relationships) and “emotional loneliness” (which focused on perceptions of the &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; of one’s relationships). They also completed questionnaires assessing levels of childhood and adult trauma, depression and anxiety, and their psychological wellbeing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following convention, the 17.1 per cent of participants who scored a certain amount above the average loneliness score for the sample (by more than one standard deviation)  were classified as “lonely” – a figure comparable to that found previously in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also used a statistical technique to look for qualitative differences between the participants’ loneliness responses, and this revealed four distinct classes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first class – which they called “low loneliness” – was characterised by low scores on both types of loneliness, social and emotional. Just over half the participants fell into this category. The second class – “social loneliness” – making up 8.2 per cent of the sample, comprised people low on emotional loneliness, but high on social loneliness. The third class – “emotional loneliness” – made up just over a quarter of the total sample and was characterised by the opposite pattern of high emotional loneliness but low levels of social loneliness. People in the fourth and final “social and emotional loneliness” class, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the sample, scored high for both types of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a clear gradient of psychological distress across the classes. People in the low loneliness class were, predictably, least distressed, followed by people in the “social loneliness” class, then the “emotional loneliness” class, and finally the “social and emotional loneliness” class. In fact, people in both these last two classes had levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and negative psychological wellbeing that were reflective of a psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, quality of relationships appears more important to mental health than the sheer number of them.“These results indicate that while the experience of social loneliness is associated with slight diminutions in overall mental health, relative to the low loneliness class, the experience of emotional loneliness has a substantially greater, and more negative impact on overall mental health status,” the researchers write. “The combination of social and emotional loneliness is associated with the poorest mental health status,” they note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who belonged to the emotional loneliness class were more likely to be female, younger than average for the group, not in a relationship and to have suffered an increased number of childhood traumas. (Every childhood traumatic experience increased the odds of belonging to the emotional loneliness class by 28 per cent.) The same associations were true for the “social and emotional” loneliness class – except they were also characterised by a greater number of adult traumas.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 39.0 per cent, the total percentage of participants who fell into the two loneliness classes characterised by clinically relevant levels of psychological distress was much higher than the 17.1 per cent loneliness figure obtained using the conventional one-dimensional approach. “This finding indicates that by recognising naturally occurring subtypes of loneliness, the number of people experiencing a form… that is likely to be of clinical relevance is more than double the number identified when loneliness is conceptualised as a unidimensional construct,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work suggests that in assessing loneliness, whether in an individual or at a national level, it’s important to recognise there are various subtypes. It also supports findings from some other studies that it’s the quality, not quantity, of your relationships that really matters. As the researchers conclude: “From a societal perspective, and in the interests of reducing the burden of psychological distress, efforts should be made to enhance the quality of social connections as opposed to promoting the virtues of larger social networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-018-1597-8&quot;&gt;Quality not quantity: loneliness subtypes, psychological trauma, and mental health in the US adult population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ultimate goal of invasive recordings is one of direct intervention, by delivering targeted brain stimulation as a treatment. But first you have to establish a firm relationship between neural activity and mood. Well, um, smartphone swipes (the way you interact with your phone) aim to establish a firm relationship between your “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127813/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;smartphone usage based on not what you type, but how you type and scroll&quot;&gt;digital phenotype&lt;/a&gt;” and your mood. And then refer you to an app for a precision intervention. Or to your therapist / psychiatrist, who has to buy into use of the digital phenotyping software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the invasive side of the question, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darpa.mil/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&quot;&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/darpa-allocates-70-million-for.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in deep brain stimulation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DBS&lt;/a&gt;)  as a treatment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-tale-of-two-brains-braini-and-darpas.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many disorders&lt;/a&gt; – Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depression, Borderline  Personality Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Traumatic  Brain Injury, Substance Abuse/Addiction, Fibromyalgia/Chronic  Pain, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;. None of the work has led to effective treatments (yet?), but the DARPA research model has established large centers of collaborating scientists who record from the brains of epilepsy patients. And a lot of very impressive papers have emerged – some &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/03/automatically-triggered-brain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt;, others &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/12/bad-news-for-darpas-ram-program.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not so much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recent study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)31313-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kirkby et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) used machine learning to discover brain networks that encode variations in self-reported mood.

These biomarkers are generated from patterns in  smartphone use such as swipes, taps, and other touchscreen activities,  and are scientifically validated to provide measurements of cognition  and mood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whither RDoC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2014/a-new-approach-to-clinical-trials.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIMH established a mandate&lt;/a&gt; requiring that  all clinical trials should postulate a neural circuit “mechanism” that would be responsible for any efficacious response. Thus, clinical investigators were forced to make up simplistic biological explanations for their psychosocial interventions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I hypothesize that the circuit mechanism for my elaborate new psychotherapy protocol which eliminates fear memories (e.g., specific phobias, PTSD) is implemented by down-regulation of amygdala activity while participants view pictures of fearful faces using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10683827&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Modulating emotional responses: effects of a neocortical network on the limbic system (Hariri et al. 2000)&quot;&gt;Hariri task&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s1600/Hariri%2Btask.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;409&quot; data-original-width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s320/Hariri%2Btask.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[a fictitious example]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm including a substantial portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2014/a-new-approach-to-clinical-trials.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 27, 2014 text&lt;/a&gt; here because it's important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;NIMH is making three important changes to how we will fund clinical trials.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, future trials will follow an experimental medicine approach in which interventions serve not only as potential treatments, but as probes to generate information about the mechanisms underlying a disorder. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trial proposals will need to identify a target or mediator; a positive result will require not only that an intervention ameliorated a symptom, but that it had a demonstrable effect on a target, such as a neural pathway implicated in the disorder or a key cognitive operation. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While experimental medicine has become an accepted approach for drug development, we believe it is equally important for the development of psychosocial treatments. It offers us a way to understand the mechanisms by which these treatments are leading to clinical change. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so the target &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; be a key cognitive operation. But let's say your intervention is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/communities/homelessness/housing-first.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Housing First&lt;/a&gt; initiative in homeless individuals with severe mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. Your manipulation is to compare quality of life outcomes for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-vancouver-at-home-study-overview-and-methods-of-a-housing-first-trial-among-individuals-who-are-homeless-and-living-with-mental-illness-2167-0870.1000123.php?aid=9838&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Housing First with Assertive Community Treatment vs. Congregate Housing with on-site supports vs. treatment as usual&lt;/a&gt;. What is the key cognitive operation here? Fortunately, this project was funded by the Canadian government and did not need to compete for NIMH funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my ultimate issue is one of fundamental fairness. Is it OK to skate away from the wreckage and profit by making millions of dollars? From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/star-neuroscientist-tom-insel-leaves-google-spawned-verily-startup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and  genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that I realize  that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers  published by cool scientists at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I  don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing  hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people  who have mental illness,” Insel says. “I hold myself accountable for  that.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how? You've admitted to spending $20 billion on cool projects and cool papers and cool scientists who do basic research. This has great value. But the big mistakes were an unrealistic promise of treatments and cures, and the charade of forcing scientists who study &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; to explain how they're going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594136&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Crossing the Worm-Brain Barrier by Using Caenorhabditis elegans to Explore Fundamentals of Human Psychiatric Illness&quot;&gt;cure psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Dr. Bruce Cuthbert was especially instrumental, as well as a large panel of experts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; guest blogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rhi_willmot?lang=en&quot;&gt;Rhiannon Willmot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophers have long debated what constitutes genuine altruism. Some have argued that any acts, no matter however charitable, that benefit both the actor as well as the recipient, are altruistically “impure”, and thus can’t qualify as genuinely selfless. For example, volunteering at a soup kitchen would no longer be considered altruistic if we received a hot meal in return for our efforts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other scholars have argued that the act remains altruistic if the benefits of prosocial behaviour are an unintended consequence. From this perspective, if the meal is unexpected, our actions are still deemed selfless.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117301701&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; Ryan Carlson and Jamil Zaki have shed light on these questions by investigating what the general population thinks of different prosocial acts, depending on their motives and consequences.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding popular perceptions of prosocial behavior can not only help resolve the altruism debate, but also provide information about how our behaviour might be viewed by others, and whether our personal opinions on selflessness match up with the general belief. For example, why might we perceive the supposedly altruistic behaviour of a public figure differently to our friends, and is social media really the right place to publicise prosocial acts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36423&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers first asked 270 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website to rate how altruistic they perceived behaviours in eight hypothetical scenarios. Participants in one group received only a description of the scenario (“Jane gives blood at a local clinic”), whereas participants in two other groups were also informed about what motivated the act (“Jane gives blood in order to impress her friends”), or about the consequences for the actors (“Jane gives blood, and impresses her friends”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants told about the actor’s motives were influenced dramatically by what they read. They condemned behaviours driven by material or social gain as actively selfish, and even acting altruistically as a way to derive emotional benefit (for instance, to feel good) they viewed as significantly less altruistic than purely other-oriented activity. This suggests we discredit individuals who anticipate some kind of reward as a result of their prosocial behaviour, and that we are particularly harsh when this relates to receiving material gifts, or impressing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing about consequences made less difference to participants’ judgments. However, they did rate behaviours that reaped material or social gain as slightly less altruistic than behaviours that obtained emotional rewards.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting results was that participants rated the same prosocial act as equally altruistic whether they were told explicitly that it had been carried out purely to help others or they were not given any information about motives. This contradicts the idea that people are naturally sceptical, and actually suggests we are likely to assume prosocial behaviour is carried out selflessly by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, Carlson and Zaki repeated their original experiment with more participants, and introduced a fourth group to investigate the role of neutral actions, such as going to the cinema. The results of study 1 were replicated, however Carlson and Zaki also found that if a prosocial action (that benefited others) was performed for material or social benefit then it was actually seen as less altruistic than neutral actions (that didn’t benefit others).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest the precise motive for an act, rather than its consequence, is the main factor in determining whether we perceive the act as altruistic or not. This effect is so powerful in fact that it can lead us to define certain types of prosocial behaviour as less altruistic than actions which provide no benefits to others at all.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this perception exist? Carlson and Zaki conclude that our social judgments are influenced more by what drives people to act than the consequences they receive. This is because we use perceived motives to predict future behaviour. Those who are only prosocial under certain conditions are less reliable, and performing outwardly selfless acts for selfish reasons might even represent a deceptive and dangerous character.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the current work leave several avenues for further research. For example, it would be interesting to discover how judgements of altruism differ in populations who value the relative importance of intentions and consequences differently from the average perception, such as those with autism.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now these recent findings suggest that if you promote your charitable efforts on twitter, you could be viewed as less altruistic than someone who isn’t involved with prosocial behaviour at all. Ultimately, this comes down to whether we are viewed as seeking social glory, versus recruiting others to join a charitable cause. Whilst it seems humans take altruistic acts at face value when given no context, it is the appearance of our motive for acting that is key.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the list of failed replications &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;continues to build&lt;/a&gt;, psychology’s reproducibility crisis is becoming harder to ignore. Now, in a new paper that seems likely to ruffle a few feathers, researchers suggest that even many apparent successful replications in neuroimaging research could be standing on shaky ground.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As the paper’s title bluntly puts it, the way imaging results are currently analysed “allows presenting anything as a replicated finding.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provocative argument is put forward by YongWook Hong from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea and colleagues, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514521v1&quot;&gt;preprint posted recently to bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;. The fundamental problem, say the researchers, is that scientists conducting neuroimaging research tend to make and test hypotheses with reference to large brain structures. Yet neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), gather data at a much more fine-grained resolution.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that strikingly different patterns of brain activity could produce what appears to be the same result. For example, one lab might find that a face recognition task activates the amygdala (a structure found on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotional processing). Later, another lab apparently replicates this finding, showing activation in the same structure during the same task. But the amygdala contains hundreds of individual “voxels”, the three-dimensional pixels that form the basic unit of fMRI data. So the second lab could have found activity in a completely different part of the amygdala, yet it would appear that they had replicated the original result.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36458&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors’ arguments are not simply theoretical: in a series of experiments, Hong and colleagues demonstrate that replications are not always what they seem. The team used an imaging dataset they’d collected and published in a previous study, which examined the similarity of the brain’s responses to physical pain and social rejection. First, they divided the data into two groups, containing 30 and 29 participants respectively. For the sake of their demonstration, they pretended that these groups were two separate cohorts, the first group the “original” cohort, and the second a cohort used for a replication attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the kind of approach typically used in many neuroimaging experiments and replication attempts, they then examined the brain activity exhibited in response to rejection and pain in each of these groups, focusing on an area in the front of the brain called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The first group showed increased activity in the dACC to both rejection and pain – and so did the second, suggesting that the initial result had been successfully replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the team looked within the dACC to see where in the structure activation was strongest, they found that the groups differed considerably. For the social rejection condition in particular, the location of this “peak” activation for the second group was a whopping 43mm away from the peak for the first group, at the opposite end of the dACC. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results might seem to suggest that the location of peak activation could provide a better indication of whether a finding has replicated than looking at average activity levels across a brain area. But in a subsequent experiment, the authors found that the location of peak activation didn’t actually have much bearing on the overall &lt;i&gt;pattern&lt;/i&gt; of activity. That is, there was a lot of information about the underlying distribution of activity that wasn’t captured by only looking at the peaks either.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors say that pattern-based analysis methods are a better option for figuring out whether or not a result has been replicated. Rather than simply looking at the average activity across a brain structure or where peak activation is, this kind of analysis uses information about the distribution of activity across many voxels and brain regions. This would allow researchers to directly compare the similarity of overall patterns of activity between studies. Alongside other improved methods of analysis, the authors say, “these practices will provide researchers with more robust spatial tests, helping us move one step towards resolving the current replication crisis in neuroimaging studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they may be facing an uphill battle. In a survey of 135 previously published papers that claimed to have successfully replicated previous findings, Hong and his colleagues found that 85.3 per cent based their conclusions merely on finding activity in the same brain region as the original study, and more than 40 per cent didn’t even compare peak co-ordinates. A meagre 7.4 per cent conducted the kind of pattern-based analysis that the Hong’s team recommend. This suggests that it may be a while before the authors see their recommendations put into practice.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514521v1&quot;&gt;False-positive neuroimaging: Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final version published in a journal may differ from the version that this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to make progress on software that is to be included in
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/neuron&quot;&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt; was approved for inclusion and is now in testing. This is without MPI
support, and does not currently contain Python bindings. These are both being
worked on now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/auryn&quot;&gt;auryn&lt;/a&gt; was approved for inclusion. While it builds fine on &lt;code&gt;x86_64,
i686, ppc64&lt;/code&gt;, it does not build on other secondary architectures:
&lt;code&gt;armv7hl, aarch64, s390x&lt;/code&gt;. So, we have filed a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fzenke/auryn/issues/33&quot;&gt;ticket upstream&lt;/a&gt; to clarify if these are
supported. You can read more about the architectures Fedora supports &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various other packages were updated to their latest versions: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-fsleyes&quot;&gt;fsleyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-pydicom&quot;&gt;pydicom&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-nibabel&quot;&gt;nibabel&lt;/a&gt;. You
can test them by enabling the updates-testing repository and give feedback on
these updates (documented &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of packages need to be updated to their latest versions.
Unfortunately, a few of these bundle software that must be removed, so it
takes more time than simple updates: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674578&quot;&gt;InsightToolkit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1371436&quot;&gt;vxl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674946&quot;&gt;gdcm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how many of us listen to music while studying or doing other cerebral work, you’d think psychology would have a set of clear answers as to whether the practice is likely to help or hinder performance. In fact, the research literature is rather a mess (not that that has deterred some enterprising individuals from making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/neuroscience-music-app/&quot;&gt;bold claims&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the largely discredited “Mozart Effect” – the idea that listening to classical music can boost subsequent IQ, except that when first documented in the 90s the effect was on spatial reasoning specifically, not general IQ. Also, since then the finding has not replicated, or it has proven weak and is probably explained as a simple effect of music on mood or arousal on performance. And anyway, that’s about listening to music and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; doing mental tasks, rather than both simultaneously. Other research on listening to music &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; we do mental work has suggested it can be distracting (known as the “irrelevant sound effect”), especially if we’re doing mental arithmetic or anything that involves holding information in the correct order in short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the hope of injecting more clarity and realism into the literature, Manuel Gonzalez and John Aiello have tested the common-sense idea that the effects of background music on mental task performance will depend on three things: the nature of the music, the nature of the task, and the personality of the person. “We hope that our findings encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic, interactionist approach to investigate the effects of music (and more broadly, distractions) on task performance,” they write in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-03876-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36388&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 142 undergrads (75 per cent were women) and asked them to complete two mental tasks. The simpler task involved finding and crossing out all of the letter As in a sample of text. The more complex task involved studying lists of word pairs and then trying to recall the pairs when presented with just one word from each pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each task was performed while listening to one of two versions of a piece of elevator-style instrumental music – composed for the research – or no music. One version of the music was more complex than the other, featuring additional bass and drum tracks (both versions are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/xs85u/&quot;&gt;via the Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;). Also, depending on the precise experimental condition, the music was either quiet or louder (62 or 78 decibels). The participants also completed part of the “boredom proneness scale” to establish whether they were the kind of person who likes plenty of external stimulation or not (as measured by their agreement with statements like “it takes a lot of change and variety to keep me really happy”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ performance was explained by an interaction between the task, the music, and their preference for external stimulation. When performing the simpler task, participants not prone to boredom did better while listening to complex music than simple music or no music, whereas boredom prone participants showed the opposite pattern, performing better with no music at all or simple music. In terms of volume, the low boredom prone were better with quiet complex music, whereas the boredom prone did better with louder complex music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ explanation is that for low boredom people who aren’t so keen on external stimulation, the quieter, more complex music provided just enough distraction to stop them from mind wandering from the simple task, thus boosting their task focus and performance. In contrast, the more boredom prone participants who like external stimulation tuned in too much to the complex music and were overly distracted by it, thus performing worse than when working in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more complex task, the precise nature of the music (its complexity and volume) made no difference to results. But people low in boredom proneness benefited from having any kind of music in the background (the researchers aren’t sure why, but perhaps there were mood or arousal-based benefits not measured in this study), whereas once again the boredom prone folk with a preference for external stimulation again actually performed better with no music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these findings may seem counterintuitive, the researchers’ explanation is that, for boredom prone people, the complex task provided adequate stimulation and background music interfered with this productive engagement. Supporting this interpretation, the more boredom prone participants outperformed their less boredom prone peers at the task in the no-music condition (and at an earlier, baseline cognitive test), suggesting they engaged better with the tasks (the researchers additionally noted that this result challenges the way that boredom as an emotion is usually seen as a bad thing, suggesting “it can predict constructive outcomes, such as better complex task performance”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you consider yourself as prone to boredom and craving of external stimulation, a tentative implication of these findings – bearing in mind they are preliminary – is that you might be better off studying or do other cerebral work without music in the background, at least not music that is too complex. On the other hand, if you are less craving of stimulation, then paradoxically some background music could boost your performance. As the researchers stated: “we offer evidence against the commonly held belief that distractions like music will always harm task performance.” They added, “our findings suggest that the relationship between music and task performance is not ‘one-size-fits-all’. In other words, music does not appear to impair or benefit performance equally for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem with interpreting the results is in the ambiguity of the aspect of boredom proneness that the researchers looked at – “preference for external stimulation”. Past research has generally considered boredom proneness to be associated with less desirable aspects of personality, such as having less self-control and being more impetuous, and this could fit with the idea that boredom prone participants in this research were more distracted by background music. However, as mentioned, the participants scoring higher on “preference for external stimulation” generally performed better at the tasks, thus raising questions about what aspect of personality and/or mental aptitude was really being tapped by this measure. It doesn’t help matters that there was no direct measure of attentional control and focus in the study. (In terms of other relevant personality traits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/neuroscience-music-app/&quot;&gt;prior research&lt;/a&gt; has found that introverts are more distracted than extraverts by highly arousing music).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other obvious limitations include the question of how much the featured tasks resemble real-life challenges, and the fact that people often listen to music they know and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/02/music-we-like-can-be-more-distracting-than-music-we-dont/&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; rather than unfamiliar, instrumental music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s laudable that the current research attempted to consider how various factors interact in explaining the effect of music on mental performance. Gonzalez and John Aiello concluded, “we hope our research will serve as a starting point for more systematic investigation of music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-03876-001&quot;&gt;More than meets the ear: Investigating how music affects cognitive task performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Respectful maternity care – the way forward</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/02/15/respectful-maternity-care-way-forward/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/African-woman-with-baby-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent WHO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/anc-positive-pregnancy-experience/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for care during pregnancy and childbirth have emphasised the need for ensuring a positive experience for women. Respectful maternity care is a universal human right for every child-bearing woman around the globe, as advocated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteribbonalliance.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White Ribbon Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (WRA) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are numerous studies showing that this right is not in place yet in many settings. The WRA published the Respectful Maternity Care (RMC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteribbonalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Final_RMC_Charter.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charter&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and thankfully more and more stakeholders are becoming aware of the need to treat women with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respectful maternity care is a universal human right … However, there are numerous studies showing that this right is not in place yet in many settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter sets out various forms of disrespect and abuse (D&amp;amp;A) as well as the key areas of RMC that ensure patient-centered care. These include the right to information, informed consent and refusal, and respect for a woman’s choices and preferences, including companionship during maternity care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence of D&amp;amp;A in maternity care, especially in low-resource settings. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123606&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; exploring the quality of care during childbirth in Kenya, up to 20% of women felt humiliated during labour and birth. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-015-0024-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Ethiopia reported that women’s basic rights to information and informed consent were violated in all cases included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to explore some of the reasons behind this. The results of our study, titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2189-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘We are the ones who should make the decision’ – Knowledge and understanding of the rights-based approach to maternity care among women and healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;,” indicate that there is still a lot to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of the RMC Charter and the problems it highlights is still very low among some of the key stakeholders in maternal and newborn health in our hospital in Malawi. This is especially true of healthcare providers, who are expected to act to prevent (not perpetuate) D&amp;amp;A and to treat women with respect and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10829&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10829&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Yellow-sari-baby-with-wrist-tie-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Indian woman in sari holding her 3 months old baby, India&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we found that women valued skilled professional care at birth and recognised this to be of benefit to them, but they said they would prefer to be assisted by a student midwife who treats them with respect and dignity than by a qualified professional midwife who does not. This is a strong wake-up call to all stakeholders that RMC is no longer optional – it is an essential part of maternity care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study also highlights the importance of involving women in decisions about their health and that of their babies. We didn’t expect this finding given that the study was conducted in a setting where many women are still illiterate, and decisions are often taken at the family/community level rather than at the individual level. But the women who participated in our group discussions were very keen to be informed about their care and to be involved in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Way Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How best can we raise awareness about RMC? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-018-0662-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper by O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues has proposed that for awareness-raising campaigns to be successful, there should be strategic planning to capture the attention of key stakeholders and to deliver persuasive messages. There needs to be a receptive environment that maximises the use of existing and potential resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the principles of the RMC Charter into existing maternal and newborn services is a worthwhile effort. However, RMC should not be treated separately from the rest of the maternity services. It should be made an integral part of service delivery processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4755-11-71&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bohren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.) indicate that there is a strong link between the experience and perception of quality of care by women and the uptake of maternity services in low-resource settings, including skilled birth attendance. Eliminating D&amp;amp;A and providing high-quality professional maternity care will have a triple effect: women will be satisfied with the care they receive; healthcare providers will have a sense of satisfaction; and, with improved uptake of evidence-based care packages, maternal and newborn health outcomes will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmnh.lstmed.ac.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centre for Maternal and Newborn Health&lt;/a&gt;, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, we work with stakeholders, including healthcare providers, and conduct implementation research in low-resource settings to improve the quality of maternal and newborn health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder&quot;&gt;Developmental coordination disorder (DCD)&lt;/a&gt; occurs in approximately 5 to 6% of the school-aged population and can limit the academic, social, and physical abilities of the children it affects. Recent research has focused on using virtual reality and video game equipment to improve the motor skills of children with DCD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-10821 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/video-games-1557358_1920-1-300x200.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pixabay&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentiplay et al systematically reviewed 15 studies looking at the use of video games in DCD affected children. Nintendo Wii was the most commonly used intervention, appearing in 12 of the 15 studies. None of the studies included used virtual reality. While the studies included showed limited evidence to support the effectiveness of video games in improving the motor skills of DCD children, the majority of children both enjoyed and adhered to the video game interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women. In the last twenty years, the breast cancer rate has been increasing worldwide. The link between human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer has been widely accepted. However, the link between viruses and breast cancer is less well-established. Recent studies have indicated that exposure to some viruses, including HPV, is a risk factor for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPV genome was detected in 48.6% of breast cancer samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent publication by Khodabandehlou et al, researchers determined the presence of HPV in breast cancer tissue. The HPV genome was detected in 48.6% of breast cancer samples. The researchers concluded that HPV is associated with breast cancer development but determining the exact mechanism and role of HPV in breast cancers will require further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Materials: The newest addition to the BMC Series, now open for submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BMC Series continued its expansion into the physical science and engineering this month with the opening of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Materials&lt;/a&gt;. The journal is now accepting submissions spanning the multi-disciplinary areas of materials science including fundamental and applied research in the synthesis, characterization, modelling and application of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor Harriet Manning, PhD recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2019/01/22/introducing-bmc-materials/&quot;&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;describing the launch and how BMC Materials will meet the needs of the community by adding to the rapidly growing realm of open access materials science publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering and BMC Biomedical Engineering: First articles published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the BMC Series’ recently launched engineering journals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, published their first articles this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the first publications are articles ranging in topics from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42490-019-0001-4&quot;&gt;history of robotic and laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42480-019-0002-z&quot;&gt;increasing the permeability of polymeric membranes in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0906-y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Family Practice: A survey of the attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about medical cannabis among primary care providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis&quot;&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt; is currently listed as a schedule I drug by the US Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. However, 29 US states and the District of Columbia have programs &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10824 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/computer-3343887_1920-300x178.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;allowing for the use of cannabis in specific medical conditions. Minnesota created its medical cannabis comprehensive program in May of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by Philpot et al, examines the attitude, beliefs, and knowledge about medical cannabis held by Minnesota primary care providers. They found that providers generally believe medical cannabis is a legitimate medical therapy. Greater than half of providers surveyed believed that medical cannabis is effective in the management of nausea and/or vomiting, muscle spasms, pain, and anxiety. However, 50% of providers surveyed indicated they “were not ready or did not want to answer patient questions about medical cannabis,” indicating that further work is needed to disseminate knowledge among primary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10822 alignright&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/pills-3673645_1920-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Medication adherence, the extent to which medications are taken following the instructions of a medical provider, is imperative to the management of many chronic diseases. However, estimates indicate that between 30 and 50% of people do not take their medications as prescribed. Adherence is particularly challenging in the older population because older people are often prescribed multiple medications and are sometimes affected by physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic review conducted by Ulley et al, examined the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprescribing&quot;&gt;deprescribing&lt;/a&gt; on medication adherence in an older population. They concluded that deprescribing did not improve medication adherence. However, they theorize that this may be because the interventions in the included studies did not sufficiently reduce the amount of medication being taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotine and nicotinic compounds bind to acetylcholine receptors, but, surprisingly, it is largely unknown whether they act by activating or by desensitising (= inactivating) these receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simulated a simple circuit of dopaminergic and gaba-ergic neurons, each of them expressing different subtypes of nicotinic receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main conclusion was that many nicotinic compounds act by desensitising their receptors. We also formulated a new hypothesis on nicotine addiction. We propose that smoking in addicted people my be a form of self-medication: by desensitising the nicotinic receptors on GABAergic neurons, nicotine disinhibits the dopamine-neurons and restores their physiological response to acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have a basic drive to learn and develop and to see themselves and the world in new ways. That’s according to the psychologists Arthur Aron and Elaine Aron, who refer to this as our need for “self-expansion”. It follows from their theory that any chance to self-expand should be rewarding, and that if you can self-expand while doing things with your romantic partner then your relationship will benefit. Previous research has hinted that this is the case, finding that when couples engaged in self-expanding activities together – anything that felt new, exciting, interesting and/or challenging – their satisfaction with their relationship increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-47337-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; Amy Muise at York University and her colleagues have taken things further, laying out evidence that a major part of the reason that participating in self-expanding activities is good for relationships is that it boosts your sexual desire for your partner and increases the likelihood you will have rewarding sex – and, moreover, that this is particularly the case for people in long-term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36409&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two 21-day diary studies, the researchers recruited over 200 couples who had been in an exclusive relationship (most of them heterosexual) for an average of 8 years (the first study) or 5 years (the second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night the participants recorded on their own whether they had engaged in self-expanding activities with their partner that day (they answered questions like “How much did being with your partner expand your sense of the kind of person you are?” and “How much did you feel you gained a larger perspective on things because of your partner?”), and – in the second study only – they gave a specific example of an activity, if any, that they did with their partner that day that led to feelings of excitement, greater awareness, an expanded sense of self, and/or increased knowledge of the self and the world (see examples below). Participants also answered questions about their mood that day, overall time spent with their partner, their relationship satisfaction that day, their sexual desire for their partner, sexual satisfaction, and any sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results across the two diary studies – the first conducted in Canada, the second in the USA – were similar: On days that participants reported engaging in more self-expanding activities with their partner, they also reported more sexual desire for their partner, were more likely to have sex, and to feel satisfied with that sex and their relationship. These associations were stronger for couples who’d been together longer. “Having new experiences with a long-term partner may be more important to spark some of the feelings of desire and excitement from the early stages of relationships, feelings that may be harder to recall for couples who are in longer compared with shorter relationships,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some “dyadic effects” – that is, one person’s greater feelings of self-expansion were also associated with their partner tending to report greater sexual desire (perhaps because their partner was attracted by seeing them in a new light or seeing them undertaking new challenges), and both one’s own and one’s partner’s higher feelings of self-expansion were related to a greater likelihood of having sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings mostly remained statistically significant after controlling for any daily changes in mood, feelings of closeness, and time spent together; and a mediation analysis suggested that increased sexual desire was driving the association between greater feelings of self-expansion and increased sexual activity. Across the two diary studies, on days that self-expansion scores were high, the couples were between 25 and 34 per cent more likely to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diary research hinted at the direction of the causal effects in the measured outcomes – for instance, more self-expansion today was associated with more relationship satisfaction tomorrow, whereas the reverse was not true (relationship satisfaction today did not predict more self-expansion the next day). However, to test the causal role of self-expanding activities more explicitly, the researchers conducted a final experimental study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a weekend, the researchers tested whether coaching 51 couples to engage in more self-expanding activities together would lead them to experience the beneficial effects implied by the diary studies (the instructional advice came in the form of a fabricated magazine article that described the benefits of engaging together in new and exciting activities). For comparison, 65 couples looked at a fabricated article about the benefits of doing familiar things together, while another 82 couples acted as a no-intervention control and received no information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures taken at the end of the weekend showed that couples who read the self-expansion article heeded the advice and engaged in more self-expanding activities together; they were also the only group to enjoy a boost in sexual desire over the weekend compared with before, and there was also a non-significant trend for them to have more sex than couples in the other groups (75 per cent of the self-expansion couples said they’d had sex over the weekend, compared with 63 per cent in the familiar condition, and 58 per cent in the no-intervention control condition). The self-expansion couples also reported higher levels of sexual desire and relationship satisfaction than the no-intervention control couples, but not more than the couples encouraged to do familiar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics may look at some of the examples of self-expanding activities that participants most frequently described in the second study (see above) – such as having a pizza and watching TV together, doing household chores together, or even, although less often, having an argument – and wonder where the feelings of self-expansion came from. What made some couples perceive such apparently mundane activities as self-expanding? The current research does not have any answers to this question, other than that the type of self-expanding activity and how physically arousing it was (as coded by researchers), did not appear to make any difference to the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the unexceptional nature of some of the activity examples suggests that, before rushing to book that tandem bungee jump or hot-air balloon ride, it is worth considering that the secret to self-expansion lies not so much in the precise nature of the activities you undertake together, and more in your perceptions of what you do and in the attitude and the mindset you bring – especially whether you can find the magic and mystery in the mundane. Exploring more about when and why and for whom this mindset is possible is for future research to consider. For now, Muise and her team conclude that “one way couples can promote desire in their relationship, and in turn, their relationship satisfaction and sexual connection, is by engaging in self-expanding activities together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love it when preprints go on to be accepted as formal journal publications and we are especially excited to announce that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204186&quot;&gt;EMT network-based feature selection improves prognosis prediction in lung adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a featured preprint in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/10/live-streamed-preprint-journal-clubs/&quot;&gt;Open Access week event&lt;/a&gt;, is now published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, we celebrated OA Week’s theme of “Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge” by teaming up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/inst/14743-prereview&quot;&gt;PREreview&lt;/a&gt; to host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/users/164141/articles/301936-about-live-streamed-prereview-journal-clubs-liveprejc&quot;&gt;virtual preprint journal clubs&lt;/a&gt; where researchers from around the world could share their expert opinions on preprints AND get credit for their reviews. Thanks to this event, the authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/410472v1&quot;&gt;this preprint&lt;/a&gt; received crowd-sourced feedback on their work even as their submission underwent formal peer review by &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Borong Shao took advantage of the unique opportunity to participate in the discussion and we asked her to tell us what she thought of preprints and the virtual journal club experience. Read her thoughts below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about your research? What made you decide to post the work as a preprint?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were working on the topic of molecular signature identification using multiple Omics data. The reason why we posted our work was to let our new results reach the research community. Based on our experience, preprint works are also read and discussed by researchers, as well as the formally accepted ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does your field or research community feel about preprints in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my opinion, preprints are welcomed if the work has a great idea to share. This can assist or even inspire other researchers in their work without waiting for the article to be formally accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your experience discussing your preprint at a live journal club—How did you feel about the opportunity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was a bit nervous because I had no such experience before. I wondered whether the audience would have positive or negative opinions about my work, although I think my work has its value. I was excited too, because our work is read by researchers all over the world. Some of them are from a relevant but not the same discipline. I was curious to know their opinions on our manuscript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you use any of the feedback from the virtual journal club? Did you find this kind of feedback useful in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both my professor and me found the suggestions from the virtual journal club very helpful. They gave us useful advice from the viewpoints of both readers and researchers. Much of the feedback can be implemented in a short time to improve the quality of our work. Some other feedback can be learned and used in our future research. There were a few mistakes that we might not have found out, if not learned from PREreview feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints aren’t just helpful to authors– early comments from your community can also help editors at the journal conduct their evaluation of the work. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;Academic Editor Aamir Ahmad had the opportunity to handle Dr. Shao’s submission and felt that the early feedback process was “a great initiative… the feedback was excellent in general and the authors did a good job of incorporating the changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS wholeheartedly supports preprints and the myriad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; they offer researchers.  We’re making it easier for authors to share their work as a preprint, immediately upon submission, through our posting service in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/12/plos-authors-say-yes-to-preprints/&quot;&gt;partnership with bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; and we were happy to find another partner in PREreview who have pioneered live preprint journal clubs for early discussions like these to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on preprints &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/preprints&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and live-streamed journal clubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/users/164141/articles/301936-about-live-streamed-prereview-journal-clubs-liveprejc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please also join us in congratulating Dr. Shao and her co-authors on their recent publication!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagination is sometimes claimed to be a uniquely human ability, and it has long intrigued psychologists. “Nevertheless, our understanding of the benefits and risks that individual differences in imagination hold for psychological outcomes is currently limited,” note two researchers who have created a new psychometric test – the Imaginative Behaviour Engagement Scale (IBES) – for measuring how much imagination a person has, and then used it to investigate whether, as some earlier work hinted, having a stronger imagination might aid learning and creativity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36380&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sophie von Stumm at the University of York and Hannah Scott at UCL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12369&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, imagination is the tendency to create “mental representations of concepts, ideas and sensations in the mind that are not contemporaneously perceived by the senses [and ranges] from the re-creation of images or sensory perceptions in the mind that were previously seen and experienced in reality ….to crafting images anew independent of prior actual sensory input.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly a snappy definition. But that’s partly a consequence of what the pair terms the “definition and measurement issues” that have plagued academic inquiry into imagination, including a lack of agreement among psychologists on a precise definition that distinguishes it from related constructs, such as fantasy or mental imagery.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To research what the new test should include, von Stumm and Scott conducted a literature search and interviews with “expert psychometricians”. This led them to identify seven “domains of imagination” and their test includes two items measuring each of these, including how much a person: had imaginary friends as a child; is inclined to daydreaming; dreams; thinking styles (for example: “Do you ever play around with ideas just for fun?”); how often they feel a sense of feeling transported while reading a book or watching a movie; their “imaginative responsiveness” (for example: “If you wished, could you imagine that you had an additional arm so much that you would feel the limb and its movements?”) and their proclivity for fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the pair explored links between imagination (based on the IBES), personality and learning performance in 180 participants who were mostly undergraduate students. After taking an initial logical thinking test and then studying a scholarly text, the participants were immediately tested, and then later re-tested a week later, to see what they could remember of the text. They also completed the IBES and personality surveys at various time-points. Their IBES scores correlated with their learning ability, but only very weakly and not as strongly as did their scores on the logical thinking test and on Openness to Experience (one of the Big Five personality traits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study of 128 mostly British members of the general population, von Stumm and Scott looked for any associations between measures of imagination and creativity and schizotypal beliefs. (Schizotypal beliefs include odd beliefs and magical thinking, suspiciousness – and also unusual perceptual experiences). The researchers also considered the participants’ scores on facets of Openness to Experience, including the Fantasy facet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ scores on imagination correlated with just one aspect of their creativity known as “creative ideation” (defined as the use of, appreciation of and skill with ideas, assessed using a self-report scale). Notably, imagination scores were &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; related to creative ability, which was measured using tests that asked the participants to write down as many uses as they could think of for a ping pong ball, a plank of wood and a paperclip (responses were scored for originality and functionality), nor with real-life creative achievements. On the other hand, a stronger imagination &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; correlated more strongly with the schizotypal belief scales and the Fantasy facet of the Openness to Experience personality trait (in fact, as the authors note, their new IBES test seemed to be tapping something very similar to the Fantasy personality facet) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that being more imaginative – as measured in this study – is associated more with having schizotypal beliefs (or non-helpful “cognitive eccentricities”) rather than being something that’s useful in accumulating knowledge or producing new and useful ideas. This may be because learning and (to a certain extent) creativity require focused attention. “We propose here that the shared lack of executive control in imagination and schizotypal beliefs gives rise to their association and differentiates them from effortful, more regulated cognitive processes like learning and creativity,” von Stumm and Scott write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with the study, though, is in the wording used to tap participants’ creative ideation and imagination, compared with the test for creative ability, and also creative achievement (which measured their total creative achievements – such as having a song recorded – in their lives to date) . For the first two, participants reported their &lt;i&gt;typical &lt;/i&gt;behavior, whereas for creative ability and achievement, their maximum ability was measured – this discrepancy could have easily skewed the results and led to lower correlations between imagination and creative ability/achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s worth noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217346/&quot;&gt;other work&lt;/a&gt; has found an association between schizotypy and creativity, so “cognitive eccentricities” may sometimes be useful. It’s hard, too, to believe that the strength of one’s imagination would be essentially irrelevant to one’s creative ability – in certain fields, anyway. JK Rowling, for instance, may have applied herself to the focused job of constructing a coherent plot, but without a strong, unfocused imagination, it’s hard to see how she would have achieved her creative success.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, do the results really show? The clearest suggestions from all this correlational data seem to be that if you have a strong imagination, this won’t help you with academic study. It might mean that you’re more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. It’s also associated with creative thinking, though not creative ability and achievement (at least not as measured in this study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clearer idea of how the strength of imagination affects various outcomes in life will require longitudinal research. Certainly, the debate about what exactly imagination is – and how it may help or hinder us – is not over yet.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12369&quot;&gt;Imagination links with schizotypal beliefs, not with creativity or learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has stood in the supermarket aisle trying to remember their shopping list might have wished for a larger brain. But when it comes to memory, bigger isn’t always better. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that young children whose cerebral cortex is thinner in certain areas also tend to have better working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36374&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of previous brain imaging studies already found that working memory – which we use for remembering and manipulating pieces of information over short timescales – involves a network of brain areas in both the frontal and parietal cortices.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of these studies examined adults and older children, and few researchers have investigated younger children aged 4 to 6. At this age, children’s working memory usually improves drastically, so it’s important to understand what is going on in the brain, especially if this could help children with learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Morgan Botdorf and Tracy Riggins from the University of Maryland scanned the brains of 189 healthy children with no known learning difficulties aged between 4 and 8. An impressive 186 of the children remained still enough during the scan to provide usable data.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate session outside of the MRI scanner, the researchers also assessed the kids’ working memory using the forward digit span task, which measures how many digits a child can hold in their memory.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botdorf and Riggins then looked at how performance on this test was related to the thickness of four brain areas known to be important in working memory: the superior frontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. They found that in all four regions, children with &lt;em&gt;thinner&lt;/em&gt; grey matter tended to be able to hold more numbers in memory – they had what psychologists call “a higher digit span”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this result might seem counter-intuitive, it is not completely unexpected that a thinner cortex in these areas is related to better memory. During development, connections between neurons are “pruned”, restructuring and streamlining the brain in a way that is thought to improve memory and cognition, and the study authors suggest that this process is taking place in their participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether these key brain regions were thinner in the older children – and if so, whether this could help explain why older children generally have better working memory. One region did seem to be involved in the effects of aging on working memory: older children had a thinner anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn was related to having a higher digit span. The researchers suggest that in young children, the anterior cingulate cortex “may be developing particularly rapidly” and so have an important role in the cognitive changes that occur in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from age, a number of other factors could influence the thickness of cortical areas. Previous research has implicated genetics and lifestyle factors like vitamin consumption and stress, for example, though the researchers note that the evidence for these is often sketchy. “A ripe avenue for future research would be to focus on identifying specific factors that impact the structure of the cortex, particularly during early childhood,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of what causes cortical thinning, researchers could begin to figure out how to intervene to facilitate these changes and improve working memory in children at risk of memory impairments. This is an important consideration as working memory is strongly related to educational achievement at school, and so the new study is a step in the right direction.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the new research is that it only looked at children’s ability to store verbal information, not other important functions of working memory, such as remembering visual information. It remains to be seen whether these other aspects of memory are also related to the thickness of young children’s grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;When less is more: Thinner fronto-parietal cortices are associated with better forward digit span performance during early childhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I remember, people told me to always exercise and eat well to stay fit and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts in both the public and private sector to promote the consumption of healthier foods and motivate people to be more physically active, obesity remains a major concern worldwide. There are currently about 2 billion people overweight, of which 650 million are obese, indicating that obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight&quot;&gt;WHO, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being overweight or obese is highly discouraged, as it is a major risk factor of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and heart failure amongst many other pathologies. Obesity would also have an immediate impact on your mental health and amount to a reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know that obesity is also a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, at the GUTS laboratory we wanted to investigate the impact of obesity and body composition on survival after cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you measure obesity and body composition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are generally considered obese when they have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30. You can calculate your own BMI by dividing your weight in kg by the square of your height in meters (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A healthy BMI should be between 20-24.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. People with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem with BMI scales is that they do not distinguish between fat and muscle mass and do not accurately reflect the lipid content and inflammation occurring in the fat tissue. People with a high muscle mass and low fat mass, a condition often linked to a healthy lifestyle, may therefore have the same BMI as people with almost no muscle but with a high amount of fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10811&quot; style=&quot;width: 871px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10811&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;861&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image provided by authors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, some other techniques are currently available that give a much better estimation of your body composition including computed tomography (CT)-scans. CT-scans can not only provide you with information on the amount of whole-body fat and muscle mass, but they can also give you some qualitative information on your body tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the influence of BMI and body composition on survival in cancer patients, we performed detailed body composition analyses on CT scans of 217 patients with advanced colorectal cancer that do not respond to chemotherapy. Much to our surprise, we found that in this patient population, obese patients had a better survival than non-obese patients. Obesity is a known risk factor for colon cancer incidence, so why would it be beneficial in our study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation could be a different role of obesity depending on the stage of the disease.  Where the adverse metabolic and inflammatory status linked to obesity takes precedence in the acquisition of colorectal cancer and the early stages of the disease, a larger amount of energy stored in your fat tissue becomes increasingly important and beneficial in an advanced stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is also supported by our more detailed body composition data showing that not only a high amount of muscle mass but also fat mass is beneficial in a late stage of the disease. We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival. Whether the prognostic impact of adipose tissue density in our study is mediated by malnutrition, the role of inflammation, and/or an altered function of the fat cells, is currently being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our study shows that beyond the analysis of specific tumor mutations, which is often the only element used for personalized treatment, we should also take into account the physical state and the patient’s body composition in patient’s treatment decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-641963334-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why focus on healthy weight gain in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gestational weight gain (GWG) outside of guidelines is linked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586887&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative health consequences&lt;/a&gt; for both the mother and her baby. Pregnant women who gain weight in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32813/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, also adopted for use in Australia (where we did our study), have the lowest risk of pregnancy and birth-related complications. Women who gain more are more likely to experience high blood pressure and diabetes in pregnancy, longer hospital stays after birth, and Cesarean sections. They are also more likely to have trouble losing weight after the baby is born and to have difficulty breastfeeding. Women who do not gain enough weight are more likely to deliver their baby early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less than a third of pregnant women gain the right amount.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of over 1 million pregnant women, linked above, 47% had GWG greater than and 23% had GWG less than IOM recommendations. With the service changes made in our hospital’s antenatal care processes, we have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1747-0080.12475&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document significant reduction in excess GWG&lt;/a&gt; (decreasing from 57.3% to 32.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we support women’s healthy weight gain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10803&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10803&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-494561744-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Stethoscope with financial statement [credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;In pregnancy, weighing as a stand-alone intervention does not reduce excessive GWG. However, approaches that include dietary advice and physical activity, supported by ongoing weight monitoring, can prevent excessive GWG. Routine weighing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13790&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acceptable&lt;/a&gt; to women and has not been shown to increase anxiety or distress. It is also a valuable opportunity to act and counsel women to support a healthy pregnancy. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13511&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many services do not regularly weigh pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, often due to historical routines and beliefs .&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you build it (properly), they will come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut instinct says that if you tell people what to do they will do it – disseminate guidelines, deliver training, display posters – but evidence shows otherwise. Just as telling someone they need to exercise regularly for good health rarely results in a long-term change in routine, similarly, a more nuanced and tailored approach is required to facilitate sustainable changes in healthcare delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-1-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Implementation Science&lt;/a&gt; – the field of scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine care. The approach we took in our large tertiary maternity service follows the recommended steps to develop effective health care interventions. In this case, we wanted behaviors of health professionals, teams, and the organization to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who needs to do what, differently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What barriers and enablers need to be addressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which intervention components (behavior change techniques and modes of delivery) could help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can behavior change be measured and understood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a body of work that synthesized data from the literature, clinical observations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-13-117&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216325&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;surveys &lt;/a&gt;(i.e. theory, evidence, and practical issues), we followed this four-step approach to select the most appropriate components of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mcn.12266&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our implementation intervention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements of a system-wide intervention to improve GWG guideline adherence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10804&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10804&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/IMG_2774-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early steps in our work resulted in a number of service and system changes, informed by our use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-38&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theoretical domains framework&lt;/a&gt; (TDF). This allowed us to sort and categorize the barriers we faced to achieving best GWG practice. The domains from the TDF relevant to our maternity service included: &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Skills&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Social and professional role/identity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Beliefs about capabilities&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Environmental context and resources.&lt;/em&gt; This led to us increasing dietitian time in clinic (including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-131&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dietitian-led early antenatal workshop&lt;/a&gt;), development of GWG resources for maternity staff to use (including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellness.mater.org.au/Our-Services/Nutrition-and-Dietetics/Outpatients/The-Mater-Personalised-Pregnancy-Weight-Tracker-©&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weight tracker&lt;/a&gt;), and staff training around GWG. Our changes were small but targeted – made within service capacity and with reorientation of existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed better compliance with individual guideline elements but overall adherence did not improve. The focus of this research related to the same identified gaps, and strategies were implemented in stages including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staff in-services training outlining and incorporating the evidence into practice via voiceover PowerPoint presentation (2014),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obtaining scales for each antenatal clinic room (2014), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removal of a default ‘skip’ option from the e-health record where weight is recorded, to promote mandatory entries (September 2016).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is more effective for ensuring weight recording in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2162-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; assessed the cumulative influence of these interventions on staff’s compliance to recording of antenatal weights. Using routinely collected data across the same periods of our interventions allowed us to easily compare staff’s documentation of women’s weights at antenatal visits to measure how each intervention affected practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three 15-month cohorts (from April 2014 to December 2017), there were approximately 39,000 pregnancies. The proportion of women who had a weight recorded at each visit per cohort differed significantly between cohorts, from 4.2% (baseline) to 18.9% (scales and in-services) to 61.8% (medical record prompts) (p &amp;lt;0.001). Improvements were observed across the entire service, in all models of care and with all professional groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think global, act local.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance on memory to follow recommended practices from guidelines less-consistently elicits behavior change compared to routine structural changes to facilitate their implementation. Our interventions showed greater improvements than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001096.pub2/full&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously documented for reminder systems&lt;/a&gt; (usually only ~4%), perhaps through being uniquely tailored to the local barriers. Simple system changes appear to be most effective for sustainable outcomes in this instance of antenatal weight recording. This reflects findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publish.csiro.au/AH/AH17255&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent eHealth review&lt;/a&gt; that highlighted substantial improvements in accuracy and completeness of clinical information as well as guideline adherence when electronic medical records are integrated into workflow processes (used at the point of care). Future guideline implementation projects should look beyond education sessions to harnessing systems and technology which will support their desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Cholesterol Can Positively Impact Women’s Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics bear out the folk wisdom that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1018115&quot;&gt;women live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;. However, living longer doesn’t necessarily equate to living better. All too often, dementia robs older women of what could be the happiest time of their lives. And while medical science continues to try to solve the problem of dementia, to date, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease represents approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dementia.org.au/about-dementia/types-of-dementia/alzheimers-disease&quot;&gt;60-80% of all dementia cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it is just one of approximately 50 known causes of dementia. Yet, we’ve hardly even scratched the surface on treating Alzheimer’s, let alone those many other lesser-known causes. Nearly two-thirds of those suffering from dementia are women, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/how-good-cholesterol-can-keep-women-s-brains-healthy&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; have only performed a handful of studies to study how the disease progresses in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, two&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9887-z&quot;&gt; recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9970-5&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/medicine-and-radiology-research/royal-melbourne-hospital/healthy-ageing-program/womens-healthy-ageing-project&quot;&gt;Women’s Healthy Ageing Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne are now bringing to light not only how dementia develops in women, but also how women can delay or prevent it. Much of the research points to two systems of the body — the cardiovascular system (heart) and the nervous system (brain) — and how they work in tandem to either slow down or speed up the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grey and White Matter and Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of brain matter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18117.htm&quot;&gt;white matter and grey matter. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered the amount of grey matter a woman has at age 60 can serve as a reliable predictor of her memory ability at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that one sure sign of dementia in older adults is a decrease in grey matter volume. What’s new about the research at the University of Melbourne, however, is how to potentially &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; this decline in grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the cardiovascular system comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains require a lot of blood, and proper circulation is critical to ensuring our brains receive not only the rich oxygen blood provides but also valuable nutrients and fats the brain needs to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Role Does Cholesterol Play in Brain Health?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple rule when it comes to heart health and brain health is:  ‘what’s good for your heart is good for your brain’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia Australia recommends five steps to reduce your risk of dementia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainmatters.org.au/5-simple-steps/step-1-look-after-your-heart&quot;&gt;‘Look after your heart’&lt;/a&gt; is rule number one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bad:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When women develop a high level of LDL, or ‘bad’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides&quot;&gt;cholesterol,&lt;/a&gt; it clogs blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the brain. Starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients causes grey matter mass to decline. White matter also sustains damage from lack of adequate blood flow, meaning the different parts of the brain no longer “talk” to each other the way they previously did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, predictably, is a drastic decline in cognitive function, including the ability to remember learned information and the ability to form new memories. When allowed to continue unchecked, dementia develops at a much faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The good:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, women with normal levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol, called HDL which carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver showed less &lt;em&gt;white matter&lt;/em&gt; damage in their brain a decade later when they conducted late-life brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women’s Healthy Ageing Project researchers point out that maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol impacts on the structure of the brain directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk of developing dementia, or to stave it off as long as possible, it’s critical to talk to your doctor about getting your cholesterol under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest strategies to target major cardiovascular risk factors at midlife might also be effective in reducing the development of brain lesions and late life cognitive decline,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says Professor Szoeke, one of the lead researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And while our findings relate to women, we know healthy lifestyles are important for men to maintain their brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been supported by converging evidence from the firing of neurons, the release of dopamine, and the blood-flow seen in fMRI. That evidence has been gathered across diverse species, from humans, monkeys, rats, and bees. There is even causal evidence that forcing dopamine neurons to fire sends error signals in the brain, effects we can see in the behaviour of the animals whose dopamine neurons are being toyed with. The theory bridges data from the scale of human behaviour down to the level of single neurons. Unlike many theories for the brain, this one is properly computational, and makes multiple, non-trivial predictions that have turned out to be true. Dopamine and errors in predictions are intimately intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this intimate link raises a bigger but rarely articulated question. It’s perfectly possible to build a brain that learns from errors without any explicit representation of that error in the brain. So why does the brain have an error signal for rewards at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand that question, first we need to know a little about the prediction error theory itself. The theory says that dopamine neurons fire to unexpectedly good things. If I suddenly tap you on the shoulder and hand you a sweet, your dopamine neurons go ping! for the sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I keep tapping you on the shoulder, and keep giving you a sweet, your dopamine neurons stop going ping for the sweet — getting a sweet is great but it is no longer unexpected (and frankly you’d rather I respected your personal space a bit more). Instead, the dopamine neurons go ping! for the tap itself. This is the clever bit: the neuron goes ping! because the tap on the shoulder now reliably predicts a sweet is coming (a good thing), but it’s unexpected because you don’t know when the tap is coming — so the tap on the shoulder becomes the unexpectedly good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory also says that dopamine neurons, like people, are deeply upset by their routines being violated. Having established this relationship of trust — me repeatedly tapping you on the shoulder and you at least getting a series of sweets out of this violation of social norms — what happens if I tap you on the shoulder and then don’t give you a sweet? Your dopamine neurons then shut down completely, stop firing at all for a brief period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, dopamine neurons send a rapid signal that covers all three possible errors in predicting a reward: that the reward was better than expected (a positive error); that the reward was exactly as expected (no error); or that the reward was less than expected (a negative error). We can label all this using one of those torturous compound nouns beloved of scientists: dopamine neurons send a reward prediction error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This correspondence between dopamine and “reward prediction error” has its roots in the branch of AI called reinforcement learning (well, technically, it’s a branch of machine learning, but as everything is now labelled AI, including a FitBit which I’m pretty sure is just an accelerometer with a strap, then AI it is). Reinforcement learning is the accumulation of algorithms for how something can learn from being told only how wrong or right its own predictions were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the classic algorithms of reinforcement learning have an explicit signal for the error in predicting how valuable a choice will be (where the roll call of algorithms include bandits, Temporal Difference learning, Q learning, SARSA, or Actor-Critic). This is the signal between the predicted value of what happens next, and the actual value of what happens next — where value is measured by the expected amount of future reward. The magic of reinforcement learning is that by simply minimising this error between the predicted and actual value of each next thing in the world, an artificial agent can learn remarkably complex sequences of events, like navigating across a world, or how to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is the computational part of the dopamine theory: that the rapid responses of dopamine neurons just are the prediction error of reinforcement learning algorithms. That they are the error between the predicted and actual value of what happens next. And that they are used to learn. The key to this theory is not just that the dopamine neurons signal the difference between what reward you got and what you expected. It is that they also transfer that signal to unexpected things that predict reward, exactly as reinforcement learning algorithms say they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that dopamine neuron are only encoding this prediction error. There are many nuances to what dopamine neurons themselves may be interested in, a super-set of things beyond prediction errors. And indeed errors in predicting reward are but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817301587?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;a sub-set of the possible errors in predictions about the world&lt;/a&gt; that could exist in the brain (a story for next time). But that dopamine neurons encode an error in predicting reward seems a well-established part of what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And this proposed correspondence between the rapid response of dopamine neurons and a prediction error is true of more elaborate reinforcement learning algorithms too, such as the exciting revival and extension of Peter Dayan’s “successor representation” idea by Sam Gershman, Ida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8#auth-1&quot;&gt;Momennejad&lt;/a&gt;, Kim Stachenfeld and colleagues. In the successor representation account, there is not one simple error between what you predicted and what you got, but a whole vector of errors about predictions for changes to different features of the world — one of which is reward. &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1645&quot;&gt;A recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from Gershman and colleagues shows how thinking of the rapid dopamine neuron response as the sum of those errors can explain some perplexing recent findings about dopamine neurons sending rapid signals to changes in the world that aren’t reward.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was no need for this correspondence twixt neuron and theoretical error signal to exist. The algorithms of reinforcement learning are based on observations of animal behaviour. And they can be very successful: animals, including humans, often really do behave like they are using a prediction error in reward to learn about the world. But just because we can describe behaviour using an error in prediction about reward, it does not follow that there has to be such an explicit error signal in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For it is perfectly possible to construct a system that learns about the world using feedback that does not have an explicit signal for the error in its predictions. One example of these systems is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000049&quot;&gt;a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt;, one that learns about the probabilities of things in the future, rather than certainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1560&quot;&gt;Such a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt; might represent the uncertainty about what the value of taking action A will be. This uncertainty will encoded by a probability distribution — which we might write P(value|action A) — for the possible values of taking action A. For example, there might be a high probability that taking action A will have a low value, and a low probability it will have a high value; or vice-versa; or something far more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We plonk our poor Bayesian agent in the dullest world imaginable. Its entire life consists of choosing which of three levers it should pull in order to win a coin, over and over again. As the chances of winning a coin are different between the three levers, so the agent has to work out which to pull in order to get the most coins in the long run. Three levers, so three possible actions, so three corresponding probability distributions for the value of each lever. Each round the agent picks a lever based on those probability distributions — perhaps it tends to pick the one which currently gives the highest probability of the largest reward — and watches for the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coin or not, the agent uses the outcome to update its probability distribution. A coin is evidence that the lever is good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a high value; no coin is evidence that the lever is no good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a low value. Either way, the agent now has more information about the action it chose, regardless of whether it was a good outcome or a bad outcome. The probability distribution for that action is updated to reflect that information by changing the parameters of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no error signal. The agent is learning from feedback about the world, and can use its learning to make decisions, but has no prediction error signal. Sure, we could construct one — by computing the difference between the probability distributions before and after the coin arrived — but we don’t need one. The error signal is implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is behaviour, not yet the brain. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2004.10.007&quot;&gt;many believe&lt;/a&gt; the brain represents the world using probability distributions; and there are plausible theories for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3495&quot;&gt;how to represent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.01.003&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; probability distributions using neurons. These boil down adjusting the firing of the population of neurons representing a probability distribution. And you do that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004485&quot;&gt;by adjusting the strengths of the inputs&lt;/a&gt; to those neurons (whether those inputs be from within the population or outside it). So the brain just needs a signal about whether or not a reward occurred, and use that to adjust connections. No complicated signal about the error in predictions is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a brain could learn from reinforcement with or without an explicit signal for errors in predicting that reinforcement. But the brain does have an explicit error signal encoded by dopamine neurons. What does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it tells us three interesting ideas for how the brain works. I think — fully prepared to be wrong about this, and for there to be a water-tight argument for why you can’t build a brain without an explicit signal for errors in predicting reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first idea is that the existence of an explicit error signal implies the existence of a simple representation of the world in the brain. A so-named “model-free” representation that does not represent every possible outcome of an action, and likely does not use probability either. A quickly accessible look-up table of the values of actions, that is used to choose actions when time is pressing or the world is unchanging. We already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2011.02.009&quot;&gt;some good ideas&lt;/a&gt; of where such representations live in the brain. And all forms of such simple representations we know about require an explicit signal for the error between actual and predicted values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second idea is that what is one concept in reinforcement learning is actually two processes in the brain. The one concept in reinforcement learning is that you use the error in your prediction to change your estimate of an action’s value. Why is this two processes in the brain? Because the brain might want to separately control short-term and long-term changes in the estimates of an action’s value. And having an explicit error signal carried by dopamine lets it do both with one signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get long-term changes we could adjust our estimate of an action’s value by changing up or down the strength of connections onto neurons representing that action. Adjusting our estimate of value in this way changes long-term behaviour. And the rapid dopamine signal is indeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002034&quot;&gt;thought to control&lt;/a&gt; whether and in which direction some connections in the brain are allowed to change their strengths. Here you need the sign of the error signal to tell the connections which direction to change in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the brain doesn’t necessarily want each and every bit of feedback it gets to change a connection between neurons. For that locks it into a path from which it might be difficult to recover. Indeed, when we try and change the strengths of these connections ourselves, by stimulating the inputs to a neuron, some of them can prove remarkably difficult to shift. Which raises the possibility that, in the short-term, the brain may want to hedge its bets, by changing its estimates of an action’s value without changing any connection strengths. And it can do this by instead changing how responsive neurons are to their inputs. If you make the neuron for action A more likely to fire, then you’ve increased its predicted value; and vice-versa. Guess which transmitter in the brain has many hundreds of papers showing it changes the responsiveness of neurons that control action? Yep, dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, the argument here is that the explicit error signal exists to allow the brain to control changes of predicted value on two time-scales. And do that using one error signal coded by dopamine: to both allow changing connection strengths in the long-term, and change how responsive neurons are in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third idea is that an explicit error signal in the brain is evolutionary happenstance. Building a system to learn from feedback is easier with an explicit error signal than with representations of probabilities across a group of neurons. Ancient animals likely had a neuron or two that spritzes dopamine, or something similar, as part of their control of movement. We can find plenty of invertebrates with a just a few thousand neurons in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0136-08.2008&quot;&gt;dopamine alters movement &lt;/a&gt;by changing the ways neurons respond to their inputs. With this dopamine system in place, perhaps the path of least resistance for evolution was to co-opt this broadcast signal to change the coupling between neurons following an error. Which seems potentially easier than, from the same crude beginnings, first evolving a distributed system for representing information that does not require an explicit error signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributions of theory to neuroscience are as much about showing what the brain doesn’t or can’t do, as what it can do. Yes, if we allow any arbitrary idea, this space is practically infinite: theories showing that the brain doesn’t use strawberry jelly as a neurotransmitter, or doesn’t compute using the back of an envelope and a blunt pencil are not useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here we find an explicit error signal in the brain, and that rules out a whole class of ways of doing learning from feedback, and rules some in. The reward prediction error theory of dopamine tells us as much by what it doesn’t do, as what does. In the garden of forking paths, we should be glad of some help — and few garden paths are more forking complicated than the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?
