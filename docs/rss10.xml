	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Meet Service Providers with ADC (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) Expertise</title>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/03/meet-service-providers-with-adc-antibody-drug-conjugate-expertise/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1040&quot; style=&quot;width: 379px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1040&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Emtansine_mab_structure_coloured-300x147.png&quot; width=&quot;369&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Chemical structure of “emtansine” (mertansine plus linker) linked to a monoclonal antibody (maytansine black, mertansine modification red, linker blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The excitement around ADCs for treating cancer stems from the realization that traditional, small-molecule cytotoxic drugs and radiation are still some of the most potent anticancer agents, and that targeting them by tethering them to antibodies might bypass some of the side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent founding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170223005390/en/Fusion-Pharmaceuticals-Launches-25M-USD-Series-Financing&quot;&gt;investment by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson of the ADC-focused startup, Fusion Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, may provide some momentum to the development of targeted radiotherapeutics, a specific type of ADC. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s investment followed on the heels of recent ADC investments by other large pharmas, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b3cnewswire.com/201611031480/nbe-therapeutics-raises-chf-20-million-in-series-b-funding.html&quot;&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/astrazeneca-backs-adc-105m-to-support-6-clinical-oncology-candidates&quot;&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/18/906673/0/en/Immunomedics-Announces-New-Data-for-IMMU-132-at-Investor-R-D-Day.html&quot;&gt;IMMU-132&lt;/a&gt;, the ADC being developed by Immunomedics, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01969643&quot;&gt;SGN-LIV1A&lt;/a&gt; from Seattle Genetics are ADCs that are reported to target triple-negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biopharmaceutical industry currently has over two dozen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3929452/&quot;&gt;ADC candidates estimated to be in its pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that there is a current demand for scientists with specific expertise in the techniques required for designing, synthesizing, and studying these molecules. In addition to developing expertise in-house, companies are frequently partnering with smaller companies or outsourcing projects to service providers to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Science Exchange, we have a unique bird’s-eye view of ADC-focused research and the service providers that are facilitating progress in this exciting field. Researchers who order services using the Science Exchange marketplace gain rapid access to an innovative network of 3,000+ service providers, including a number that supports ADC studies, through a single contract with Science Exchange. In this blog post, we’ll go through some of the key techniques and show how featured service providers in our network are meeting needs of ADC researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key techniques for studying ADCs: Science Exchange service providers step up.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Target discovery: the abundance challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ADC research programs seek to target cell surface proteins that are unique to the cell type that is to be killed by the cytotoxin. However, cell surface proteins, and other ADC targets, are usually low in abundance and underrepresented in traditional proteomic measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newest, cutting-edge providers on the Science Exchange network is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/biognosys-zurich&quot;&gt;Biognosys&lt;/a&gt;, offering discovery proteomics solutions based on Hyper Reaction Monitoring (HRM-MS™), a Next Generation proteomics technology. Invented at Biognosys, HRM-MS delivers quantification of up to 9’000 proteins per sample across treatments or conditions and identifies significantly regulated proteins. This platform is ideal for ADC target discovery studies, with one proof-of-concept study showing the quantification of over 500 cell surface proteins from matched biopsy samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;The conjugation challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;The ideal linker between the antibody and the &lt;/span&gt;cytotoxin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt; drug is stable in the bloodstream, and if needed, can be cleaved in the specific environment of the target. Some ADC linkers are designed to dissolve the &lt;/span&gt;the reducing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt; environment of the cytosol, while others require specific enzymes of certain subcellular compartments. Other linkers are non-cleavable. The linker also has to have minimal toxicity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to some wizardry in chemical synthesis, ADC development therefore requires experience in cell-based assays and drug metabolism studies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/wuxi-apptec&quot;&gt;WuXi Apptec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/mabplex&quot;&gt;MabPlex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/chempartner&quot;&gt;ChemPartner&lt;/a&gt; are service providers listed on the Science Exchange marketplace that have worked side by side with ADC developers on all aspects of linker synthesis and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugation-related services that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/wuxi-apptec&quot;&gt;WuXi Apptec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/chempartner&quot;&gt;ChemPartner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/mabplex&quot;&gt;MabPlex&lt;/a&gt; provide include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cytotoxin development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linker development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linker and cytotoxin conjugations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drug linking site determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability studies for ADC products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Bioanalysis in ADC development: the heterogeneity challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other categories of drug molecules, ADCs can be structurally heterogeneous, because of dynamic drug:antibody ratios (DAR) and variations in linker attachment chemistry. In a recent survey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioanalysis-zone.com/2015/08/19/commentary-on-bioanalysis-of-adcs-survey-results/&quot;&gt;69% of researchers cited this structural heterogeneity as the #1 challenge&lt;/a&gt; facing bioanalysis in ADC development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;85% of the surveyed researchers reported using LC-MS for ADC bioanalysis. However, over 24% respondents had to adapt traditional LC-MS methods, using affinity capture LC-MS or accelerator MS. 42% of respondents reported using ligand-binding assays, illustrating that most researchers use more than one technique in analyzing ADCs. The complexity of analytes, in combination with the lack of regulatory guidance around ADC analysis, have resulted in the need to use multiple, individually developed, methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Science Exchange marketplace features the services of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/biognosys-zurich&quot;&gt;Biognosys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/anaquant&quot;&gt;Anaquant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/chempartner&quot;&gt;ChemPartner&lt;/a&gt;, all of which provide experience in developing analytical methods for ADCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of quantifying multiple species per sample, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/biognosys-zurich&quot;&gt;Biognosys&lt;/a&gt; provides targeted proteomics services using Multiple and Parallel Reaction Monitoring (MRM and PRM), which are techniques that offer highly specific and sensitive multiplexed quantification of selected proteins from complex biological samples. These techniques deliver absolute or relative quantification of up to 150 target proteins per run with a dynamic range of 6 orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless other service providers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/bio-synthesis&quot;&gt;Bio-Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/bionova-scientific-inc&quot;&gt;Bionova&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/maine-biotechnology-services&quot;&gt;Maine Biotechnology Services&lt;/a&gt;, are experts in analyzing ADCs using ligand-binding assays. In addition, Science Exchange’s in-house regulatory compliance team has expertise in working with representatives from regulatory agencies, to ensure that the analytical services carried out by our service providers meet necessary requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
ADC bioanalysis services on the Science Exchange marketplace include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAR (drug:antibody ratio) determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residual free drug analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmacokinetics (PK) determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Process development for ADC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the heterogeneity of a batch of ADC can make it challenging to develop a scalable, reproducible, and robust manufacturing process. Manufacturing the antibody component of the ADC faces all the same challenges as does traditional therapeutic mAb production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the demands of manufacturing, engineering quality by design is important in the nonclinical, preclinical and early clinical phases of ADC research. Expertise in antibody optimization, protein purification, and chemical synthesis are required to create less heterogeneous batches of antibodies, linkers, cytotoxins and conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Exchange service providers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/wuxi-apptec&quot;&gt;WuXi Apptec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/mabplex&quot;&gt;MabPlex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/chempartner&quot;&gt;ChemPartner&lt;/a&gt; all support ADC process development, with MabPlex’s services extending to GMP and scale-up (to kilogram scale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;PLOS is pleased to highlight here an important Op-Ed written by PLOS Co-Founder Harold Varmus, published in The New York Times on March 22, 2017.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/opinion/why-trumps-nih-cuts-should-worry-us.html?_r=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Trump’s N.I.H. Cuts Should Worry Us – The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; [Featured image: Thoka Maer]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Last week I was in London to participate in a scientific symposium. During coffee breaks, many British colleagues asked me and other American visitors to explain the bewildering news that President Trump had announced his intention&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/climate/trump-budget-science-research.html&quot;&gt; to cut the budget for the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; by 18.3 percent, about $5.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;My answer to “What is going on?” did include some consoling reminders. A presidential budget request is a proposal, not a done deal. The actual fiscal year 2018 appropriation for the N.I.H. will be determined by Congress, which has historically provided enthusiastic bipartisan support for biomedical research. Although the N.I.H. has lost a substantial amount of its spending power gradually over the past decade, it has only rarely experienced a sharp decline in actual dollars and never of this magnitude. Furthermore, strong nonpartisan opposition to Mr. Trump’s proposal will come from many quarters, including advocates of research on specific diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;But it would be a mistake to be complacent about the president’s proposal, because it is likely to have real consequences. Yes, some have said that the proposed cut to the N.I.H. will be dead on arrival in Congress. But the president’s budget proposal is still important: The administration’s representatives will need to defend it at hearings, and it could be the starting point for negotiations among appropriators. It is not difficult to imagine a compromise in which the N.I.H. suffers a steep reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7420&quot; style=&quot;width: 492px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DK comment&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7420 size-full&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/DK-comment.jpg&quot; width=&quot;492&quot; /&gt;David Knutson, speaking for PLOS, offered this comment on the New York Times Op-Ed by Harold Varmus.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;To understand just how devastating a cut of less than 20 percent of an agency’s budget would be requires some understanding of how the N.I.H. operates. Very little of its typical annual budget is spent on the agency’s administration: The industrious, underpaid government scientists who manage the funding of the N.I.H.’s research programs consume less than 5 percent of its budget. Only a bit more, about 10 percent, supports the work of government scientists. In sharp contrast, over 80 percent of its resources are devoted to competitively reviewed biomedical research projects, training programs and science centers, affecting nearly every district in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;The N.I.H. awards multiyear grants and contracts, but receives annual appropriations that must be spent that year. This means that at the start of each year most of its dollars are already committed to recipients of awards from prior years. A budget cut of the size that is proposed would effectively prevent the awarding of new grants or the renewal of any that have reached the end of a multiyear commitment. Junior scientists, already struggling in a highly competitive atmosphere, may not get a chance to have an academic career. Senior investigators might need to lay off staff, disrupting research teams and leaving projects unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-1&quot;&gt;A substantial N.I.H. budget cut would undermine the fiscal stability of universities and medical schools, many of which depend on N.I.H. funding; it would erode America’s leadership in medical research; and it would diminish opportunities to discover new ways to prevent and treat diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harold Varmus, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine and a co-recipient of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was the director of the National Institutes of Health from 1993 to 1999 and of the National Cancer Institute from 2010 to 2015.

&lt;p&gt;Some fortunate people have more “working memory” than others. It’s as if they have an extra pair of hands available for mental juggling; extremely useful for doing arithmetic and similar tasks in your head. These folk with abundant working memory capacity also tend to fare well academically and in their careers. Little surprise that “brain training” games like Lumosity and Cogmed target working memory in pursuit of these knock-on benefits (though &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/&quot;&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the training brings such benefits is weak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is surprising is the discovery a number of years ago that mentally dextrous people with greater working memory capacity seem to be particularly susceptible to “brain freeze” or choking under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368116302091&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the University of Chicago and Michigan State University attempted to find out more about why this happens. Their results suggest that actually it’s only a subgroup of high working memory people who have this problem and it’s because of their high distractibility. These high ability chokers or brain freeze victims are “typically reliant on their higher working memory resources for advanced problem solving” but their poor attentional control renders them easily distracted by anxiety, causing their usual mental deftness to break down when the pressure is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21226&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Sattizahn and his colleagues recruited 83 participants aged 18-35, including 35 men, from areas near universities. First they tested the participants’ attention control abilities using the well-established Flanker Task: participants had to identify as quickly as possible the direction of central arrows that were either surrounded by congruent flankers (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;) or incongruent flankers (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;). It’s a test of attention control because it takes mental concentration to ignore the flankers, especially on incongruent trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers tested the participants’ on some tricky mental arithmetic questions, both without any pressure and then under high pressure conditions in which there was a monetary incentive, peer pressure (poor performance would adversely affect another participant) and risk of public shaming (they were told their performance would be shared with professors and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participants completed two tests of their working memory capacity: they had to solve a sequence of basic mathematical operations or sentence comprehension questions, with each one interspersed with presentation of a single letter on screen. At the end of each run of between three and seven trials, the participants had to try to recall the letters in the correct order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: high stakes pressure adversely affected the maths performance of participants with high working memory capacity, but did not affect the performance of participants with lower working memory capacity (replicating a phenomenon first identified in a paper published in 2005; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpl.uchicago.edu/sites/hpl.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Psychological%20Science2005.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;). What’s new here is the additional measure of attentional control. This showed that only high working memory participants with poor attentional control showed evidence of this mental performance choking under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be happening is that, under low pressure conditions, people with high working memory capacity make use of their extra pair of mental hands when performing arithmetic and similar tasks, deploying more sophisticated and demanding strategies that usually allow them to excel. When they are distracted by pressure – which is especially likely if they have poor attentional control – people with high working memory still try to rely on their usual cognitively demanding approach, but now their extra mental hands are tied, so they drop the balls, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you – perhaps your brain works like lighting on your own but goes into meltdown when someone puts you on the spot at work – the good news is that the researchers have a few suggestions for how to protect yourself from choking under pressure. Sattizahn and his colleagues suggest two strategies: either reduce the distracting anxiety you experience under pressure, for example by using expressive writing to reflect on a challenge that you know is coming up; or boost your attention control skills, for instance by practising mindfulness or simply remembering to take time out to walk in nature, which is known to refresh our powers of concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a third, lazier approach: next time you suffer a potentially embarrassing bout of brain freeze in front of friends or colleagues, simply point them to this article and explain: thanks to your impressive working memory capacity you can be a little sensitive at times, would they please back off and allow your shy super brain the space that it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The metabolism of carbohydrate polymers drives microbial diversity in the human gut microbiota. It is unclear, however, whether bacterial consortia or single organisms are required to depolymerize highly complex glycans. Here we show that the gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron uses the most structurally complex glycan known: the plant pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II, cleaving all but 1 of its 21 distinct glycosidic linkages. The deconstruction of rhamnogalacturonan-II side chains and backbone are coordinated to overcome steric constraints, and the degradation involves previously undiscovered enzyme families and catalytic activities. The degradation system informs revision of the current structural model of rhamnogalacturonan-II and highlights how individual gut bacteria orchestrate manifold enzymes to metabolize the most challenging glycan in the human diet.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structural insights into adiponectin receptors suggest ceramidase activity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ZJui0D6hdxg/nature21714</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adiponectin receptors (ADIPORs) are integral membrane proteins that control glucose and lipid metabolism by mediating, at least in part, a cellular ceramidase activity that catalyses the hydrolysis of ceramide to produce sphingosine and a free fatty acid (FFA). The crystal structures of the two receptor subtypes, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, show a similar overall seven-transmembrane-domain architecture with large unoccupied cavities and a zinc binding site within the seven transmembrane domain. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ADIPORs function are not known. Here we describe the crystal structure of ADIPOR2 bound to a FFA molecule and show that ADIPOR2 possesses intrinsic basal ceramidase activity that is enhanced by adiponectin. We also identify a ceramide binding pose and propose a possible mechanism for the hydrolytic activity of ADIPOR2 using computational approaches. In molecular dynamics simulations, the side chains of residues coordinating the zinc rearrange quickly to promote the nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion onto the ceramide amide carbonyl. Furthermore, we present a revised ADIPOR1 crystal structure exhibiting a seven-transmembrane-domain architecture that is clearly distinct from that of ADIPOR2. In this structure, no FFA is observed and the ceramide binding pocket and putative zinc catalytic site are exposed to the inner membrane leaflet. ADIPOR1 also possesses intrinsic ceramidase activity, so we suspect that the two distinct structures may represent key steps in the enzymatic activity of ADIPORs. The ceramidase activity is low, however, and further studies will be required to characterize fully the enzymatic parameters and substrate specificity of ADIPORs. These insights into ADIPOR function will enable the structure-based design of potent modulators of these clinically relevant enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21714&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21714&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/ZJui0D6hdxg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The lung is a site of platelet biogenesis and a reservoir for haematopoietic progenitors</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ptOQ8VkEocA/nature21706</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses, but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also contribute to platelet biogenesis. Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Somatic mutations reveal asymmetric cellular dynamics in the early human embryo</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/zId4E5Uyy8s/nature21703</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Somatic cells acquire mutations throughout the course of an individual’s life. Mutations occurring early in embryogenesis are often present in a substantial proportion of, but not all, cells in postnatal humans and thus have particular characteristics and effects. Depending on their location in the genome and the proportion of cells they are present in, these mosaic mutations can cause a wide range of genetic disease syndromes and predispose carriers to cancer. They have a high chance of being transmitted to offspring as de novo germline mutations and, in principle, can provide insights into early human embryonic cell lineages and their contributions to adult tissues. Although it is known that gross chromosomal abnormalities are remarkably common in early human embryos, our understanding of early embryonic somatic mutations is very limited. Here we use whole-genome sequences of normal blood from 241 adults to identify 163 early embryonic mutations. We estimate that approximately three base substitution mutations occur per cell per cell-doubling event in early human embryogenesis and these are mainly attributable to two known mutational signatures. We used the mutations to reconstruct developmental lineages of adult cells and demonstrate that the two daughter cells of many early embryonic cell-doubling events contribute asymmetrically to adult blood at an approximately 2:1 ratio. This study therefore provides insights into the mutation rates, mutational processes and developmental outcomes of cell dynamics that operate during early human embryogenesis.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The allosteric inhibitor ABL001 enables dual targeting of BCR–ABL1</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is driven by the activity of the BCR–ABL1 fusion oncoprotein. ABL1 kinase inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes for patients with CML, with over 80% of patients treated with imatinib surviving for more than 10 years. Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50% of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR–ABL1 transcript levels for at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib. Consistent with this profile, acquired resistance was observed with single-agent therapy in mice; however, the combination of ABL001 and nilotinib led to complete disease control and eradicated CML xenograft tumours without recurrence after the cessation of treatment.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 For 130 years, dinosaurs have been divided into two distinct clades—Ornithischia and Saurischia. Here we present a hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships of the major dinosaurian groups that challenges the current consensus concerning early dinosaur evolution and highlights problematic aspects of current cladistic definitions. Our study has found a sister-group relationship between Ornithischia and Theropoda (united in the new clade Ornithoscelida), with Sauropodomorpha and Herrerasauridae (as the redefined Saurischia) forming its monophyletic outgroup. This new tree topology requires redefinition and rediagnosis of Dinosauria and the subsidiary dinosaurian clades. In addition, it forces re-evaluations of early dinosaur cladogenesis and character evolution, suggests that hypercarnivory was acquired independently in herrerasaurids and theropods, and offers an explanation for many of the anatomical features previously regarded as notable convergences between theropods and early ornithischians.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The brain’s ability to associate different stimuli is vital for long-term memory, but how neural ensembles encode associative memories is unknown. Here we studied how cell ensembles in the basal and lateral amygdala encode associations between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS and US, respectively). Using a miniature fluorescence microscope, we tracked the Ca2+ dynamics of ensembles of amygdalar neurons during fear learning and extinction over 6 days in behaving mice. Fear conditioning induced both up- and down-regulation of individual cells’ CS-evoked responses. This bi-directional plasticity mainly occurred after conditioning, and reshaped the neural ensemble representation of the CS to become more similar to the US representation. During extinction training with repetitive CS presentations, the CS representation became more distinctive without reverting to its original form. Throughout the experiments, the strength of the ensemble-encoded CS–US association predicted the level of behavioural conditioning in each mouse. These findings support a supervised learning model in which activation of the US representation guides the transformation of the CS representation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells. However, the personalized identification and validation of neoantigens remains a major challenge. Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle-cell lymphomas by using an integrated genomic and proteomic strategy that interrogates tumour antigen peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to systematically characterize MHC ligands from 17 patients. Remarkably, all discovered neoantigenic peptides were exclusively derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions. Although we identified MHC presentation of private polymorphic germline alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-immunoglobulin somatically mutated genes. Somatic mutations within the immunoglobulin variable region were almost exclusively presented by MHC class II. We isolated circulating CD4+ T cells specific for immunoglobulin-derived neoantigens and found these cells could mediate killing of autologous lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification, and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumour neoantigens. Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Post-mitotic, differentiated cells exhibit a variety of characteristics that contrast with those of actively growing neoplastic cells, such as the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors and differentiation factors. We hypothesized that the gene expression profiles of these differentiated cells could reveal the identities of genes that may function as tumour suppressors. Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo studies in mice and humans, that the mitochondrial protein LACTB potently inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Its mechanism of action involves alteration of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and differentiation of breast cancer cells. This is achieved, at least in part, through reduction of the levels of mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, which is involved in the synthesis of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine. These observations uncover a novel mitochondrial tumour suppressor and demonstrate a connection between mitochondrial lipid metabolism and the differentiation program of breast cancer cells, thereby revealing a previously undescribed mechanism of tumour suppression.

	<title>BMC Series blog: Cobweb spiders wrap prey with diverse silk proteins, expanding silk applications</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/03/21/cobweb-spiders-wrap-prey-diverse-silk-proteins-expanding-silk-applications/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;nature-1242617_960_720&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/nature-1242617_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through a spider web in the woods or sweeping out the silk from the corners of your house may seem like a pesky nuisance, but these tenacious webs are engineering feats. The majority of the cobweb, the frame of the orb-web, and the nearly invisible spider lifeline are all made of one type of spider silk that can have tensile strength rivaling steel. This is the major ampullate silk, named after the specialized abdominal gland in which it is synthesized. In terms of toughness, or the total amount of energy required to break, major ampullate silk outperforms steel and Kevlar. Consequently, it has been a prime target for human applications, with some textiles &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/in-the-future-well-all-wear-spider-silk?mbid=nl_170313_Daily&amp;amp;CNDID=29472763&amp;amp;spMailingID=10610432&amp;amp;spUserID=MTMzMTgyOTk4NzI0S0&amp;amp;spJobID=1121040554&amp;amp;spReportId=MTEyMTA0MDU1NAS2&quot;&gt;near production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more remarkable is that spiders do not produce just one silk type, unlike the silk moth caterpillars whose cocoons we use to make silk cloth. Instead, an orb-web weaving garden spider or cobweb weaver like the black widow make at least seven types of silk in as many morphologically distinct silk glands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8730&quot; style=&quot;width: 1290px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Silk glands were dissected from the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, and are still attached to their spinnerets (bottom center). The large ampule-shaped glands on other side are major ampullate. The smaller similar shaped glands in center top are minor ampullate.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8730&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Ayoub-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Silk glands were dissected from the false black widow, &lt;em&gt;Steatoda grossa&lt;/em&gt;, and are still attached to their spinnerets (bottom center). The large ampule-shaped glands on other side are major ampullate. The smaller similar shaped glands in center top are minor ampullate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Nadia Ayoub&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material properties of each of these silks appear to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/13/2452&quot;&gt;tailored to their ecological functions&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, spiders cover their eggs with tubuliform silk, which in garden spiders is stiffer than any other silk type. Egg sacs are thus resistant to pressure that could crush the eggs. The aciniform silk used to wrap prey by garden spiders is the toughest of its silk types, withstanding the energy output of a struggling insect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orb-web weaving spiders use minor ampullate silks as temporary capture spirals, which are not as strong as draglines but are equally tough due to their higher stretchiness. Alternatively, black widow spiders use minor ampullate silk to wrap prey, but material properties from this species were previously unknown. My colleagues and I predicted that black widow and other cobweb weaver minor ampullate silks would have divergent material properties from orb-web weavers in part due to their varying functions. We further predicted that the DNA sequences of the genes encoding the minor ampullate silk proteins would differ between orb-web and cobweb weaving spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequencing spider silk genes in undergraduate courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each type of spider silk is primarily made of one or more unique proteins that are collectively called spidroins (spider fibrous proteins). Spidroins and insect silk proteins share the property of being long (typically &amp;gt;2000 amino acids) and repetitive (short sequences of amino acids could repeat 10-100s of times). Spidroins are thus notoriously difficult to completely sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I have been using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563967/pdf/mss254.pdf&quot;&gt;combination of approaches&lt;/a&gt; to characterize spidroins. Undergraduate students started helping me collect these data when I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, Riverside in Cheryl Hayashi’s lab. When I took a tenure-track job at Washington and Lee University I decided to scale up undergraduate involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year in my Genetics Lab, 17-24 students tackle a new spider species. For our research on minor ampullate silks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0927-x&quot;&gt;recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, encoding gene sequences were characterized by three different cohorts. Three students continued working with me in the summers and ultimately became the first three authors on our publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8731&quot; style=&quot;width: 2394px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Undergraduates, Jeremy Miller (far left) and Jannelle Vienneau-Hathaway (second from left and first author), worked with Nadia Ayoub (second from right) on cobweb spiders’ minor ampullate silk genes.

Pictured at Arthropod Genomics Symposium, 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Jessica Garb&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variation in minor ampullate silk proteins correlates with variation in silk properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of sequencing spider silk genes, we discovered unexpected diversity of minor ampullate silk proteins. Not only did orb-web weaver sequences differ from cobweb weavers’, dramatic differences were also found among cobweb weavers. Even more surprising was that each species’ genome included multiple genes encoding minor ampullate silk proteins, and these sequences were often strikingly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, the brown widow (invasive in the United States), has one minor ampullate gene that encodes a protein only 815 amino acids long and includes “motifs” typical for minor ampullate proteins: e.g. glycine-alanine repeats. Another brown widow gene encodes a minor ampullate protein more than double the size of the first (1791 amino acids) that is riddled with glycine-proline-glycine. Proline tends to make a kink in proteins. Thus many glycine-proline-glycine iterations form spring-like spirals, which should make the protein elastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The false black widow’s minor ampullate proteins were the most proline-rich. Their minor ampullate silks were correspondingly twice as extensible as the minor ampullate silks of the black and brown widow. Overall, cobweb weaver minor ampullate silks were more extensible, but not as strong as orb-web weaver silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging cobweb prey wrapping proteins for human applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sequencing methods resulted in minor ampullate-encoding genes isolated in a format that would facilitate expression of pure protein. Our work could thus contribute to efforts to spin artificial fibers with custom-made properties. For instance, the proline-containing brown widow minor ampullate spidroin could be used to make extensible fibers incorporated into artificial tendons or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/1094-spider-silk-repair-human-ligaments.html&quot;&gt;ligaments&lt;/a&gt;. The longer alanine-rich black widow proteins may make stiffer fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have a sense of what it means to be human. Research shows that we agree with each other that traits like friendly, jealous or impatient are more “human” than others like unemotional or selfless. What’s more, we like to see ourselves as human: we care more about human traits and claim to possess them more than other people. In other words, we “self-humanise”, laying claim to the good &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the bad as long as they emphasise our own humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this research on self-humanising presents a conundrum. A different, abundant line of evidence shows that humans bitterly protect a highly positive self-image, supported by cognitive biases that attribute our own failings to &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias&quot;&gt;circumstances&lt;/a&gt; and other people’s to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_attribution_bias&quot;&gt;deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;. So, do we really overestimate the bad in ourselves, claiming to be more human, warts and all? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2017.1282849&quot;&gt;a critique&lt;/a&gt; of the self-humanising field in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, this is an oversimplification: when it comes to undesirable human traits, we see ourselves as pretty similar to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21177&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Marzena Cypryańska of SWPS University Warsaw, conducted their work with 250 students from universities in Poland, Korea, and Italy. The participants – mostly in their twenties and fairly gender-balanced – rated themselves on 40 different traits relative to other students. Some traits like Sympathetic and Jealous were strongly associated with human nature, others like Selfless and Unemotional were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most previous self-humanising research has compared scores in two different categories, for example finding that people give themselves significantly higher self-ratings than others for negative human traits, but not for non-human negative traits. But Cypryańska’s team pointed out that this approach is problematic because of the kind of rating scales that have been used. Imagine a participant rates themselves on a “human” trait like Jealous using the scale below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;self-humanising scale&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-21182 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;21182&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;self-humanising scale&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;amp;h=109?w=361&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;amp;h=109?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;amp;h=109&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;361,82&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/21/more-human-than-thou-or-just-better-our-motivation-to-think-were-good-trumps-our-desire-to-feel-human/self-humanising-scale/&quot; height=&quot;109&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/self-humanising-scale.png?w=480&amp;amp;h=109&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, only a score above 4 would suggest that a participant truly believes they are “more Jealous than” others. However, the way that past research has worked, if a participant gave themselves a 3 on a negative human trait, this would be taken as a significantly higher self-rating than a 2 on a non-human negative trait. But the problem is that feeling “less” strongly that you have less of a trait than others is not the same as believing that you have “more” of it. Cypryańska and her colleagues point out that in their data, participants’ mean self-ratings of their negative traits – both human in nature and otherwise – were &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; significantly higher than 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Cypryańska and her team revisited previous work that has reported statistically significant self-humanising for negative human traits using similar rating methods, and the same pattern emerged: that is, participants rarely claimed to have more of negative human traits, they were just less bold in their claims to have less of them. So the evidence doesn’t show people are so motivated to appear human that they happily endorse ugly parts of their human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, participants did often rate themselves above the scale midpoint for positive traits, both human nature traits and other positive ones. Rather than proving we associate ourselves with human vices and virtues, these findings can be explained with the well-established &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-14648-005&quot;&gt;Better Than Average&lt;/a&gt; effect, where we associate ourselves more with positive attributes, less with negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be interesting to see how the self-humanising research body responds to this critique of their methods. Cypryańska’s group are not opposed to the idea that human traits are treated a little differently; perhaps we distance ourselves from our weaknesses, but with less fervour when they stem from a common human heritage. More research would be needed to unpick this. But according to this study, the ways we see ourselves as special have a pecking order. Good first, human later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who undertake psychotherapy seem to benefit from it. How do we know? Arguably, the most important evidence comes from meta-analyses that combine the results from many – sometimes hundreds – of randomly controlled trials. Based on this, it’s been estimated that psychotherapy is effective for about 80 per cent of people (meanwhile, between five to 10 per cent of clients &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-1/when-therapy-causes-harm&quot;&gt;may suffer adverse effects&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the more concerning news: a team of researchers led by Evangelos Evangelou at the University of Ioannina, Greece has assessed the quality of 247 of these psychotherapy meta-analyses and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acps.12713/full&quot;&gt;they report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica&lt;/em&gt; that many of them have serious methodological short-comings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, a separate research group led by Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616302410&quot;&gt;just published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt; some of the first observational data on how people’s personalities change after undertaking psychotherapy. In contrast to what’s been found &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/&quot;&gt;in the clinical literature&lt;/a&gt;, they report that people who’ve been in therapy seem to show negative changes in personality and other psychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their “umbrella review” of the psychotherapy literature, Evangelou and his team chose to include published meta-analyses covering any form of psychotherapy and almost any kind of target mental health condition, but with the proviso that each meta-analysis had itself combined the results from a minimum of ten studies. Their comprehensive search resulted in 247 unique meta-analyses which collectively synthesised data from over five thousand randomly controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 80 per cent of the published psychotherapy meta-analyses had reported a significant and positive benefit of whatever form of psychotherapy was their focus. This sounds impressive at first, but after applying “state-of-the-art” tests of their robustness, Evangelou and his colleagues report that just 16 of the 247 meta-analyses had provided “convincing evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified a number of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many meta-analyses showed a statistically significant amount of heterogeneity between the trials that they’d combined. The worry is that too many meta-analyses are comparing apples and oranges, although there is scholarly debate about what level of heterogeneity is unacceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The researchers found many instances of the “small study bias”, which is the tendency for smaller, less robust studies to report larger effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They found evidence of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1740774507079441?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&quot;&gt;excess significance bias&lt;/a&gt;“, which is when an over-abundance of trials seem to report positive findings given what we know so far about psychotherapy’s effectiveness. This suggests negative findings are remaining unpublished for whatever reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelou and his team conclude that the field of psychotherapy research needs to work harder to ensure that negative results are published as well as good news results, especially given &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/concerning-study-says-psychotherapy-research-has-a-problem-with-undeclared-researcher-bias/&quot;&gt;the findings of another recent paper&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the field has a problem with undeclared researcher allegiance to particular therapeutic approaches. One way round this is to ensure all trials and meta-analyses are preregistered before they are conducted, alongside information on the statistical tests that are planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reader undertaking psychotherapy or who knows someone who is, it is worth keeping some perspective: this is just one critique and the weight of evidence still suggests that psychotherapy is, more often than not, beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For scholars, the methodological concerns raised by this new paper feed into an already contentious field. Some experts believe that, high-quality or not, randomly controlled trials (and by extension, meta-analyses based on those trials) are not really an appropriate way to gauge the effectiveness of psychotherapy because of all complex, myriad factors involved in the dynamic between a client and his or her therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach is to look at observational data. Rather than signing people up to a controlled trial, with all the contrivances that that entails (such as standardising the delivery of therapy as much as possible), this approach is less hands-on and involves looking instead at the outcomes of people who happen to have been in therapy and those who haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Roberts and his colleagues found two sources of this kind of data: hundreds of students in Tübingen who were enrolled in a long-term personality study and who’d completed measures twice across four years; and a group of thousands of older Americans who similarly had completed personality and other measures twice across four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, both these longitudinal surveys included a question about whether the participants had undertaken psychotherapy in the intervening period between the two data collection points. One hundred and twenty-eight of the Tübingen students had completed some therapy and, compared to the other students, they showed negative changes in their personality in terms of higher scores in neuroticism, less extraversion and conscientiousness, as well as reductions in self-esteem, increases in depression, and less life satisfaction. It was a similar story for the older American adults who’d been in therapy: they showed negative changes in personality and other psychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems with how to interpret these findings – an obvious shortcoming of observational data of this kind is that it’s less controlled than an experimental trial. For example, perhaps undertaking therapy was a consequence of these unwelcome psychological changes rather than the cause (although this still wouldn’t explain why the therapy hadn’t been more helpful, more often). Whatever the explanation, however, the results &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/&quot;&gt;stand in contrast to the findings from controlled psychotherapy trials&lt;/a&gt; which have pointed overwhelming to positive personality changes arising from therapy. As Roberts and his team conclude, “the gravity of the issue necessitates that researchers investigate the apparent discrepancy between these findings and those from well-controlled trials”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Adult moths on a corn plant&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-1-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notorious fall armyworm – you’ve probably heard of it. It’s a night active moth and it’s been in the news lately as an invasive species in Africa that causes severe damage to corn and other crops, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38859851&quot;&gt;threatens the livelihoods of farmers&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/southern-africas-food-crops-under-threat-from-fall-armyworm-invasion&quot;&gt;strip southern Africa of key food sources&lt;/a&gt;. The fall armyworm (&lt;em&gt;Spodoptera frugiperda&lt;/em&gt;) originates from the Americas, where e.g. Brazil spends &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.herald.co.zw/fao-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-in-fight-against-fall-armyworm/&quot;&gt;over 600 million dollars every year&lt;/a&gt; to control the pest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we need to figure out how to control the crop pest in Africa, there are some important things we can already learn from the moth. One of the central questions in biology is: where does all the biodiversity come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall armyworm can help us answer this question, as this species occurs as two different strains, called corn-strain and rice-strain. The strains look exactly alike, but differ in some features, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456344&quot;&gt;pheromone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089255&quot;&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eea.12215/abstract&quot;&gt;host plant preference&lt;/a&gt;, but most importantly &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01759.x/abstract;jsessionid=85B84C3A8F56A14D4DCFF7F3FCB8EDD3.f04t04&quot;&gt;in their timing of mating&lt;/a&gt;: the corn-strain mates early in the night, while the rice strain mates late in the night. How did we find these differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed hundreds of couples in a dark room, lit by a red light and a red flashlight, as moths can’t see red light. After the lights went off and night set in, the corn-strain moths became active, soon followed by matings. Meanwhile, the rice-strain moths were sitting still, motionless. Only after several hours, the rice-strain moths woke up and started their mating activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8725&quot; style=&quot;width: 2570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Female adult moth extruding her pheromone gland, advertising her availability for mating&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8725&quot; height=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Female adult moth extruding her pheromone gland, advertising her availability for mating&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Sabine Hänniger&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two populations (or strains) of the same species don’t mate with each other, genes are not exchanged between these populations. Mutations that occur spontaneously are thus not exchanged and stay within the population, so that different mutations can accumulate in each population. In this way, two populations will become more and more genetically different over time, which can result in the development into two species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the strains in our dark room that were either mating early or late, we wanted to know what genetic differences had accumulated between the two strains that could explain their differences in mating times at night. Therefore, we hybridized the two strains and observed the mating activities of the parental strains together with the hybrids and their offspring throughout the night with our red flashlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8726&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hundreds of beakers for observation&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8726&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-4-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Hundreds of beakers for observation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Sabine Hänniger&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then analyzed all those individuals genetically, and by combining the observation and genetic data, we could identify one chromosome that explained most of the timing difference between the strains. We were excited when we also found out that this chromosome harbors a gene that is part of the circadian clock: &lt;em&gt;vrille&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the circadian rhythm of the corn-strain and the rice-strain appear to be out of sync and we identified &lt;em&gt;vrille&lt;/em&gt; as a candidate to cause the asynchrony. When comparing the DNA sequence of this gene between the strains, we found some interesting differences in the promoter region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circadian clock is an internal molecular clock present in most living beings on earth. Dependent on light input, genes and proteins interact with each other in a circadian rhythm that is roughly 24 hours. This rhythm helps mice, for example, to wake up and get active at night when they can’t easily be seen by predators, and it helps the fall armyworm to wake up at the right time to find a mating partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8727&quot; style=&quot;width: 2570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adult moths mating.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8727&quot; height=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Hanninger-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Adult moths mating.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Sabine Hänniger&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also looked at differences in the mRNA levels at every hour for 24 hours and found that &lt;em&gt;vrille&lt;/em&gt; is always more expressed in the rice-strain than in the corn-strain. This made us curious about how this difference influences the other genes of the circadian clock. Excitingly, we did find some differences in expression levels of the genes that directly interact with vrille in the circadian clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we may have identified a mechanism underlying evolution in progress between two strains that seem to become two different species. A change in the promoter region of the gene &lt;em&gt;vrille&lt;/em&gt; may cause a change in the transcription of the gene, which can influence the circadian clock. An altered circadian clock alters the behavior of the fall armyworm, causing the different strains to mate at different time points at night. This timing difference constitutes a mating barrier that keeps the strains apart and may facilitate the development into different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in addition to being a severe pest that needs to be eradicated, the fall armyworm has given us insights in the evolutionary process of speciation, which has led to the great biodiversity on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want more than the TL;DR, please read &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the story so far can be quickly summarised as follows: we got our Oracle Express database installed and set up by adding the required users; we then built the ODB libraries and installed the ODB compiler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After this rather grand build up, we shall finally get to look at Dogen - just about. It now seems clear these series will have to be extended by at least one or two additional instalments in order to provide a vaguely sensible treatment of the material I had initially planned to cover. I wasn't expecting N to become so large, but - like every good software project - I'm now realising you can only estimate the size of the series properly once you've actually finished it. And to rub salt into the wounds, before we can proceed we must start by addressing some of the instructions in the previous posts which were &lt;i&gt;not quite right&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Est Humanum Errare?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost point in the &lt;i&gt;errata&lt;/i&gt; agenda is concerned with the additional Oracle packages we downloaded in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;. When I had originally checked my Oracle XE install, I did not find an &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;directory, which led me to conclude that a separate download was required for driver libraries and header files. I did find this state of affairs somewhat unusual - but then again, it is Oracle we're talking about here, so &quot;unusual&quot; is the default behaviour. As it turns out, I was wrong; the header files are indeed part of the Oracle XE install, just placed under a rather… shall we say, &lt;i&gt;creative&lt;/i&gt;, location: &lt;code&gt;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/rdbms/public&lt;/code&gt;. The libraries are there too, under the slightly more conventionally named &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; directory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is quite an important find because the downloaded OCI driver has moved on to v12 whereas XE is still on v11. There is backwards compatibility, of course - and everything should work fine connecting a v12 client against an v11 database - but it does introduce an extra layer of complexity: you now need to make sure you do not simultaneously have both v11 and v12 shared objects in the path when linking and running or else you will start to get some strange warnings. As usual, we try our best to confuse only one issue at a time, so we need to make sure we are making use of v11 and purge all references to v12; this entails recompiling ODB's oracle support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; and you have already installed the ODB Oracle library, you'll need to remove it first: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rm /full/path/to/local/lib/libodb-oracle* /full/path/to/local/include/odb/oracle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember to replace &lt;code&gt;/full/path/to/local&lt;/code&gt; with the path to your local directory. Then, you can build by following the instructions as per previous post, but with &lt;b&gt;one crucial difference&lt;/b&gt; at configure time: point to the Oracle XE directories instead of the external OCI driver directories: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh&lt;br /&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/rdbms/public&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib&quot; ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, replacing the paths accordingly. If all goes well, the end result should be an ODB Oracle library that uses the OCI driver from Oracle XE. You then just need to make sure you have executed &lt;code&gt;oracle_env.sh&lt;/code&gt; before running your binary, but don't worry too much because I'll remind you later on. Whilst we're on the subject of Oracle packages, it's worth mentioning that I did a minor update to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;: you didn't need to download SQLPlus separately either, as it is also included in XE package. So, in conclusion, after a lot of faffing, it turns out you can get away with just downloading XE and nothing else. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other minor alteration to what was laid out on the original posts is that I removed the need for the &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt; database schema. In truth, the entities placed in that schema were not adding a lot of value; their use cases are already covered by the &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt; schema, so I removed the need for two schemas and collapsed them into one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A final note - not quite an &lt;i&gt;errata per se&lt;/i&gt; but still, something worthwhile mentioning. We didn't do a &quot;proper&quot; Oracle setup, so when you reboot your box you will find that the service is no longer running. You can easily restart it from the shell, logged in as root: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# cd /etc/init.d/&lt;br /&gt;# ./oracle-xe start&lt;br /&gt;Starting oracle-xe (via systemctl): oracle-xe.service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice that Debian is actually clever enough to integrate the Oracle scripts with systemd, so you can use the usual tools to find out more about this service: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# systemctl status oracle-xe&lt;br /&gt;● oracle-xe.service - SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking care of&lt;br /&gt;   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/oracle-xe; generated; vendor preset: enabled)&lt;br /&gt;   Active: active (exited) since Sun 2017-03-12 15:10:47 GMT; 6s ago&lt;br /&gt;     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)&lt;br /&gt;  Process: 16761 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/oracle-xe start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz systemd[1]: Starting SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking c…e of...&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz oracle-xe[16761]: Starting Oracle Net Listener.&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: Successful su for oracle by root&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: + ??? root:oracle&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:37 lorenz su[16772]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user oracle by (uid=0)&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz oracle-xe[16761]: Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance.&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: Successful su for oracle by root&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: + ??? root:oracle&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:39 lorenz su[16800]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user oracle by (uid=0)&lt;br /&gt;Mar 12 15:10:47 lorenz systemd[1]: Started SYSV: This is a program that is responsible for taking care of.&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all of this said, lets resume from where we left off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Installing the Remaining Packages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still have a number of packages to install, but fortunately the installation steps are easy enough so we'll cover them quickly in this section. Let's start with Dogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-2-1&quot;&gt;Dogen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-2-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing Dogen is fairly straightforward: we can just grab the latest release from BinTray: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen/0.99.0/dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb&quot;&gt;dogen 0.99.0 amd64-applications.deb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it happens, we must install v99 or above because we did a number of fixes to Dogen as a result of this series of articles; previous releases had shortcomings with their ODB support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected, the setup is pretty standard-fare debian: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ wget https://dl.bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen/0.99.0/dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb -O dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb&lt;br /&gt;$ sudo dpkg -i dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb&lt;br /&gt;[sudo] password for USER:&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package dogen-applications.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 551550 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack dogen_0.99.0_amd64-applications.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking dogen-applications (0.99.0) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up dogen-applications (0.99.0) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all has gone according to plan, you should see something along the lines of: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ dogen.knitter --version&lt;br /&gt;Dogen Knitter v0.99.0&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (C) 2015-2017 Domain Driven Consulting Plc.&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (C) 2012-2015 Marco Craveiro.&lt;br /&gt;License: GPLv3 - GNU GPL version 3 or later &amp;lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&amp;gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-2-2&quot;&gt;Dia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-2-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogen has multiple frontends - at the time of writing, JSON and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/&quot;&gt;Dia&lt;/a&gt;. We'll stick with Dia because of its visual nature, but keep in mind that what you can do with Dia you can also do with JSON. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quick word on Dia for those not in the know, copied &lt;i&gt;verbatim&lt;/i&gt; from its home page: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program for GNU/Linux, MacOS X, Unix, and Windows, and is released under the GPL license. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dia is roughly inspired by the commercial Windows program 'Visio,' though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use. It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and many other diagrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dia does not change very often, which means any old version will do. You should be able to install dia straight off of package manager: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apt-get install dia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-2-3&quot;&gt;Other Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-2-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had previously assumed Boost to be installed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; but - if nothing else, purely for the sake of completeness - here are the instructions to set it up, as well as CMake and Ninja. We will need these in order to build our application, but we won't dwell on them &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; much on them or else this series of posts would go on forever. Pretty much any recent version of Boost and CMake will do, so again we'll just stick to vanilla package manager: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# apt-get install cmake ninja-build libboost-all-dev&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mind you, you don't &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; need the entirety of Boost for this exercise, but it's just easier this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-2-4&quot;&gt;Emacs and SQL Plus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-2-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of lose notes which I might as well add here. If you wish to use SQLPlus from within Emacs - and you should, since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dbspecialists.com/an-introduction-to-emacs-sqli-mode/&quot;&gt;SQLi mode&lt;/a&gt; is just simply glorious - you can configure it to use our Oracle Express database quite easily: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(add-to-list 'exec-path &quot;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;(setenv &quot;PATH&quot; (concat (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;) &quot;:/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin&quot;))&lt;br /&gt;(setenv &quot;ORACLE_HOME&quot; &quot;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;After this you will be able to start SQL Plus from Emacs with the usual &lt;code&gt;sql-oracle&lt;/code&gt; command. I recommend you to do at least a minimal setup of SQL Plus too, to make it usable: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; set linesize 8192&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; set pagesize 50000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Introducing Zango&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this excruciatingly long setup process, we can at &lt;i&gt;long last&lt;/i&gt;start to create our very &quot;simple&quot; project. Simple in quotes because it ended up being a tad more complex than what was originally envisioned, so it was easier to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/zango&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for it. It would have been preferable to describe it from first principles, but then the commentary would literally go on for ever. A compromise had to be made. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to follow the remainder of this post please clone &lt;code&gt;zango&lt;/code&gt;from GitHub: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;git clone git@github.com:DomainDrivenConsulting/zango.git&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zango is a very small Dogen project that builds with CMake. Here are some notes on the folder structure to help you navigate: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;build/cmake&lt;/code&gt;: additional CMake modules that are not part of the standard CMake distribution. We need this for ODB, Oracle and Dogen. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;: some application data that we will use to populate our database. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt;: where all the code lives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;projects/input_models&lt;/code&gt;: location of the Dogen models - in this case, we just have one. You could, of course, place it anywhere you'd like, but traditionally this is where they live. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;projects/northwind&lt;/code&gt;: code output of the Dogen model. This is the key project of &lt;code&gt;zango&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;projects/application&lt;/code&gt;: our little command line driver for the application. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, before we get to look at the code I'd like to first talk about Northwind and on the relationship between Dogen and ODB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-1&quot;&gt;Northwind Schema&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft makes the venerable Northwind database available in CodePlex, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; location. I found a useful description of the Northwind database &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which I quote: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwind Traders Access database is a sample database that shipped with Microsoft Office suite. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called Northwind Traders, which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. You can use and experiment with Access with Northwind database while you're learning and develop ideas for Access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want a thorough introduction to Northwind, you could do worse than reading this paper: &lt;a href=&quot;http://eduglopedia.org/resource/cea008e18dee42899aeff7a0c58dddaf8e9b5bc6/download&quot;&gt;Adapting the Access Northwind Database to Support a Database Course&lt;/a&gt;. Having said that, for the purposes of this series we don't really need to dig &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; deep. In fact, I'll just present CodePlex's diagram with the tables and their relationships to give you an idea of the schema - without any further commentary - and that's more or less all that needs to be said about it: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img height=&quot;80%&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/Northwind_A4_size_for_Print.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Northwind Schema (C) Microsoft.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;i&gt;in theory&lt;/i&gt;, we could use this image to manually extract all the required information to create a Dia diagram that follows Dogen's conventions, code-generate that and Bob's your Uncle. However, &lt;i&gt;in practice&lt;/i&gt; we have a problem: the CodePlex project only contains &lt;a href=&quot;https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/releases/view/71634&quot;&gt;the SQL statements for Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the point of this exercise is to show that we can load real data from Oracle, rather than just generate random data, so it would be nice to load up the &quot;real&quot; Northwind data from their own tables. This would be more of an &quot;end-to-end&quot; test, as opposed to using ODB to generate the tables, and Dogen to generate random data which we can push to the database. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, its not entirely trivial to convert T-SQL into Oracle SQL, and since this is supposed to be a &quot;quick&quot; project on the side - focusing on ODB and Dogen - I was keen on not spending time on unrelated activities such as SQL conversions. Fortunately, I found exactly what I was looking for: a series of posts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/&quot;&gt;GeeksEngine&lt;/a&gt;entitled &quot;Convert MS Access Northwind database to Oracle&quot;. For reference, these are as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle.html&quot;&gt;How the data types in Access Northwind are converted to Oracle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle-2.html&quot;&gt;Building Oracle Northwind database objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind-oracle-3.html&quot;&gt;Queries to generate aggregated data for Oracle Northwind database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don't care too much about the details, you can just look at the Oracle SQL statements, available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksengine.com/lg.php?i=oracle-northwind-sql&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and copied across into the Zango project. I guess it's still worthwhile mentioning that GeeksEngine has reduced considerably the number of entities in the schema - for which they provide a rationale. Before we start an in-depth discussions into the merits of normalisation and de-normalisation and other DBA level topics, I have to stop you in your tracks. Please do not get too hung-up on the &quot;quality&quot; of the database schema of Northwind - either the Microsoft or the GeeksEngine one. The purpose of this exercise is merely to demonstrate how Dogen and ODB work together to provide an ORM solution. From this perspective, any vaguely realistic database schema is adequate - provided it allows us to test-drive all the features we're interested in. Whether you agree or not with the decisions the original creators of this schema made is a completely different matter, which is well beyond the scope of this series of posts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right, so now we need to setup our Northwind schema and populate it with data. For this you can open a SQL Plus session with user Northwind as explained previously and then run in the SQL script: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@/path/to/zango/data/Oracle-Northwind.sql&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;/path/to&lt;/code&gt; with the full path to your Zango checkout. This executes the GeeksEngine script against your local Oracle XE database. If all has gone well, you should now have a whole load of tables and data. You can sanity-check the setup by running the following SQL: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; select table_name from all_tables where owner = 'NORTHWIND';&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TABLE_NAME&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;ORDER_DETAILS&lt;br /&gt;CATEGORIES&lt;br /&gt;CUSTOMERS&lt;br /&gt;EMPLOYEES&lt;br /&gt;SUPPLIERS&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPERS&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;ORDERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 rows selected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; select employee_id, firstname, lastname from employees where rownum &amp;lt;3;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMPLOYEE_ID FIRSTNAME  LASTNAME&lt;br /&gt;----------- ---------- --------------------&lt;br /&gt;      1 Nancy      Davolio&lt;br /&gt;      2 Andrew     Fuller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now then, let's model these entities in Dogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-2&quot;&gt;The Dogen Model for Northwind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, I'm afraid I must make yet another disclaimer: a proper explanation on how to use Dia (and UML in general) is outside the scope of these articles, so you'll see me hand-waving quite a lot. Hopefully the diagrams are sufficiently self-explanatory for you to get the idea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process of modeling is simply to take the entities of the GeeksEngine SQL schema and to model them in Dia, following Dogen's conventions: each SQL type is converted to what we deemed to be the closest C++ type. You can open the diagram from the folder &lt;code&gt;projects/input_models/northwind.dia&lt;/code&gt;, but if you haven't got it handy, here's a screenshot of most of the UML model: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img height=&quot;90%&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/dia_with_northwind.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dogen Northwind model.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first point of note in that diagram is - if you pardon the pun - the UML note. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;odb_uml_note.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_uml_note.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/span&gt; UML Note from northwind model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This configuration is quite important so we'll discuss it a bit more detail. All lines starting with &lt;code&gt;#DOGEN&lt;/code&gt; are an extension mechanism used to supply meta-data into Dogen. First, lets have a very quick look at the model's more &quot;general settings&quot;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.dia.comment&lt;/code&gt;: this is a special command that tells Dogen to use this UML note as the source code comments for the namespace of the model (i.e. &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;). Thus the text &quot;The Northwind model is a…&quot; will become part of a doxygen comment for the namespace. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.dia.external_modules&lt;/code&gt;: this places all types into the top-level namespace &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.input_language&lt;/code&gt;: the notation for types used in this model is C++. We won't delve on this too much, but just keep in mind that Dogen supports both C++ and C#. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt.cpp.enabled&lt;/code&gt;: as we are using C++, we must enable it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt.cpp.hash.enabled&lt;/code&gt;: we not require this feature for the purposes of this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt.csharp.enabled&lt;/code&gt;: As this is a C++-only model, we will disable C#. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;annotations.profile&lt;/code&gt;: Do not worry too much about this knob, it just sets a lot of default options for this project such as copyright notices and so forth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As promised, you won't fail to notice we hand-waved quite a lot on the description of these settings. It is very difficult to explain them properly them without giving the reader an immense amount of context about Dogen. This, of course, needs to be done - particularly since we haven't really spent the required time updating the manual. However, in the interest of keeping this series of posts somewhat focused on ODB and ORM, we'll just leave it at that, with a promise to create Dogen-specific posts on them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about ORM, the next batch of settings is exactly related to that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.database_system&lt;/code&gt;: here, we're stating that we're interested in both &lt;code&gt;oracle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;postgresql&lt;/code&gt; databases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.letter_case&lt;/code&gt;: this sets the &quot;case&quot; to use for all identifiers; either &lt;code&gt;upper_case&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;lower_case&lt;/code&gt;. So if you choose &lt;code&gt;upper_case&lt;/code&gt;, all your table names will be in upper case and vice-versa. This applies to all columns and object names on the entirety of this model (e.g. &lt;code&gt;customers&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;CUSTOMERS&lt;/code&gt; and so forth). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.schema_name&lt;/code&gt;: finally we set the schema name to &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that we are in upper case, so the name becomes &lt;code&gt;NORTHWIND&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the meta-data, the second point worth noticing is that there is a large overlap between C++ classes and the entities in the original diagram. For example, we have &lt;code&gt;customers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;suppliers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;employees&lt;/code&gt; and so forth - the Object-Relational Mapping is very &quot;linear&quot;. This is a characteristic of the Dogen approach to ORM, but you do not necessarily need to use ODB in this manner; we discuss this in the next section. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If one is to look at a properties of a few attributes in more detail, one can see additional Dogen meta-data. Take &lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;customers&lt;/code&gt; class: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;odb_customer_id_attributes.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_customer_id_attributes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/span&gt; Properties of customer&lt;sub&gt;id&lt;/sub&gt; in the customer class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The setting &lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.is_primary_key&lt;/code&gt; tells Dogen that this attribute is the primary key of the table. Note that we did not use an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; as the type of &lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt; but instead made use of a Dogen feature called &quot;primitives&quot;. Primitives are simple wrappers around builtins and &quot;core&quot; types such as &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, intended to have little or no overhead after the compiler is done with them. They are useful when you want to use domain concepts to clarify intent. For example, primitives help making it obvious when you try to use a &lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt;when a &lt;code&gt;supplier_id&lt;/code&gt; was called for. It's also worth noticing that &lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt; makes use of &lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.is_nullable&lt;/code&gt; - settable to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. It results in Dogen telling ODB if a column can be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;or not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we stated, each of the attributes of these classes has the closest C++ type we could find that maps to the SQL type used in the database schema. Of course, different developers can make different choices for these types. For example, were we to store the picture data rather than a path to the picture as GeeksEngine decided to do, we would use a &lt;code&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, we'd have to perform some additional mapping too: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#DOGEN yarn.orm.type_override=postgresql,BYTEA&lt;br /&gt;#DOGEN yarn.orm.type_override=oracle,BLOB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This tells Dogen about the mapping of the attribute's type to the SQL type. Dogen then conveys this information to ODB. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogen's ORM support is still quite young - literally a couple of sprints old - so there will be cases where you may need to perform some customisation which is not yet available in its meta-model. In these cases, you can bypass Dogen and make use of ODB pragmas directly. As an example, GeeksEngine Oracle schema named a few columns in &lt;code&gt;Employees&lt;/code&gt; without underscores such as &lt;code&gt;FIRSTNAME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LASTNAME&lt;/code&gt;. We want the C++ classes to have the correct names (e.g. &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;last_name&lt;/code&gt;, etc) so we simply tell ODB that these columns have different names in the database. Take last name for example: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;odb_last_name_attributes.png&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/odb_last_name_attributes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/span&gt; Properties of last name in the employee class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A final note on composite keys. Predictably, Dogen follows the ODB approach - in that primary keys that have more than one column must be expressed as a class on its own right. In &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;, we use the postfix &lt;code&gt;_key&lt;/code&gt; for these class names in order to make them easier to identify - e.g. &lt;code&gt;order_details_key&lt;/code&gt;. You won't fail to notice that this class has the flag &lt;code&gt;yarn.orm.is_value&lt;/code&gt; set. It tells Dogen - and, by extension, ODB - that it is not really a full-blown type, which would map it to a table, but instead should be treated like other value types such as &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-3&quot;&gt;Interlude: Dogen with ODB vs Plain ODB&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The technical minutiae is all well and good&quot;, the inquisitive reader will say, &quot;but why Dogen &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; ODB? Why add yet another layer of indirection when one can just use ODB?&quot; Indeed, it may be puzzling for there to be a need for a code-generator which generates code for another code-generator. &quot;Turtles all the way down&quot; and &quot;We over-engineered it yet again&quot;, the crowd chants from the terraces. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me attempt to address some of these concerns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, it is important to understand the argument we're trying to make here: Dogen models benefit greatly from ODB, but its not necessarily the case that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; ODB users benefit from Dogen. Let's start with a classic ODB use case, which is to take an existing code base and add ORM support to it. In this scenario it makes no sense to introduce Dogen; after all, ODB requires only small changes to the original source code and has the ability to parse very complex C++. And, of course, using ODB in this manner also allows one to deal with impedance mismatches between the relational model and the object model of your domain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogen, on the other hand, exists mainly to support &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_software_development&quot;&gt;Model Driven Software Development&lt;/a&gt; (MDSD), so the modeling process is the driver. This means that one is expected to start with a Dogen model, and to use the traditional MDSD techniques for the management of the life-cycle of your model - and eventually for the generation of &lt;i&gt;entire software product lines&lt;/i&gt;. Of course, you need not buy into the whole MDSD sales pitch in order to make use of Dogen, but you should at least understand it in this context. At a bare minimum, it requires you to think in terms of Domain Models - as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design&quot;&gt;Domain Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;defines them - and then in terms of &quot;classes of features&quot; required by the elements of your domain. These we call &quot;facets&quot; in Dogen parlance. There are many such facets like &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt;, which is the ability to dump an object's state into a C++ stream - at present using JSON notation - or &lt;code&gt;serialization&lt;/code&gt; which is the ability to serialise an object using Boost serialisation. It is in this context that ODB enters the Dogen world. We could, of course, generate ORM mappings (and SQL) directly from Dogen. But given what we've seen from ODB, it seems this would be a very large project - or, conversely, we'd have very poor support, not dealing with a great number of corner cases. By generating the very minimal and very non-intrusive code that ODB needs, we benefit from the years of experience accumulated in this tool whilst at the same time making life easier for Dogen users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, as with all engineering trade-offs, this one is not without its disadvantages. When things do go wrong you now have more moving parts to go through when root-causing: was it an error in the diagram, or was it Dogen, or was it the mapping between Dogen and ODB or was it ODB?  Fortunately, I found that this situation is minimised by the way in which you end up using Dogen. For instance, all generated code can be version-controlled, so you can look at the ODB input files generated by Dogen and observe how they change with changes in the Dogen model. The Dogen ODB files should also look very much like regular hand-crafted ODB files - making use of &lt;code&gt;pragmas&lt;/code&gt; and so forth - and you are also required to run ODB manually against them. Thus, in practice, I have found troubleshooting straightforward enough that the layers of indirection end up not constituting a real problem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, its worth pointing out that the Domain Models Dogen generates have a fairly straightforward shape to them, making the ODB mapping a lot more trivial that &quot;general&quot; C++ code would have. It is because of this that we have &lt;code&gt;orm&lt;/code&gt; parameters in Dogen, which can expand to multiple ODB pragmas - the user should not need to worry about that expansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part is already becoming quite large, so I'm afraid we need to stop it here and continue on Part IV. However, we have managed to address a few of the mistakes of the Oracle setup of previous parts, introduced the remaining applications that we need to install and then discussed Northwind - both in terms of its original intent and also in terms of the Dogen objectives. Finally we provided an explanation of how Dogen and ODB fit together in a tooling ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2017-03-19 Sun 23:07&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.1.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Thank-you-640x320&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/Thank-you-640x320-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2017 marks the third year that PLOS formally acknowledges our community of reviewers and editors with a public thank you published as a citable journal article. We do this to honor the dedicated service and substantial contributions made by working scientists – scientists with day jobs – who graciously provide their time and expertise to our organization. Thank you journal articles provide reviewers and editors the academic citation and recognition for their valuable service to colleagues, institutions, funders and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a global network of more than 78,000 reviewers and 7,000 editors to ensure that articles, perspectives, editorials and more achieve the highest quality possible. The more than 12 million article views per month (on average) this past year shows that PLOS reviewers and editors are up to the task of vetting the science, the ethics, the reporting guidelines and journal publication criteria presented in the more than 27,000 research articles published in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time we are including in each of the seven journals’ thank you articles the number of newly submitted and published research articles brought to the public in 2016. We are confident that this data, in real terms, supports our ongoing commitment to increased transparency surrounding the publishing process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also confident that readers will appreciate the workload required of reviewers and editors to support these publication numbers. In addition, contributors to &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; were tasked with fine-tuning Aperta™, our new submission system, as they reviewed, discussed and moved submissions through the publication process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they shepherd papers and provide feedback so authors may improve manuscripts and refine experimental work, it is more than quality that our contributor community champions. Reviewers, Editors and Editorial Board members who choose to do so also communicate the mission of Open Access, the value of Open Data and the relevance of Open Science to society at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;These individuals serve as ambassadors not just for PLOS but for all of science. Public access to rigorous peer-reviewed research, the role of journals in communicating the work of our communities and the enthusiasm of our own staff are all sustained by this extensive pool of inspired and dedicated scientists.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of our Reviewers, Academic Editors, Guest Editors and Editorial Board members, thank you! Those wanting to explore deeper will find every reviewer’s and editor’s name in the Supporting Information of each journal’s published article; links to these articles are below.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cerebellar granule cells encode the expectation of reward</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/_o_IrLjJIGU/nature21726</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately 60 billion cerebellar granule cells, which outnumber all other brain neurons combined. Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21726&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21726&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/_o_IrLjJIGU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Ancient evolutionary origin of vertebrate enteric neurons from trunk-derived neural crest</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/4L_QZ9jdkQI/nature21679</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The enteric nervous system of jawed vertebrates arises primarily from vagal neural crest cells that migrate to the foregut and subsequently colonize and innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Here we examine development of the enteric nervous system in the basal jawless vertebrate the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to gain insight into its evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for the existence of a vagally derived enteric neural crest population in the lamprey. Rather, labelling with the lipophilic dye DiI shows that late-migrating cells, originating from the trunk neural tube and associated with nerve fibres, differentiate into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole. We propose that these trunk-derived neural crest cells may be homologous to Schwann cell precursors, recently shown in mammalian embryos to populate post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia, including enteric ganglia. Our results suggest that neural-crest-derived Schwann cell precursors made an important contribution to the ancient enteric nervous system of early jawless vertebrates, a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest cells in early gnathostomes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/qRvuaLHKn7c/nature21676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 A significant fraction of patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy experience relapse with relentless progression to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Immune checkpoint blockade using antibodies against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) or programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PD-L1) generates durable therapeutic responses in a significant subset of patients across a variety of cancer types. However, mCRPC showed overwhelming de novo resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, motivating a search for targeted therapies that overcome this resistance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to play important roles in tumour immune evasion. The abundance of circulating MDSCs correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels and metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. Mouse models of prostate cancer show that MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+) promote tumour initiation and progression. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that robust immunotherapy responses in mCRPC may be elicited by the combined actions of immune checkpoint blockade agents together with targeted agents that neutralize MDSCs yet preserve T-cell function. Here we develop a novel chimaeric mouse model of mCRPC to efficiently test combination therapies in an autochthonous setting. Combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 engendered only modest efficacy. Targeted therapy against mCRPC-infiltrating MDSCs, using multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and BEZ235, also showed minimal anti-tumour activities. Strikingly, primary and metastatic CRPC showed robust synergistic responses when immune checkpoint blockade was combined with MDSC-targeted therapy. Mechanistically, combination therapy efficacy stemmed from the upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and suppression of MDSC-promoting cytokines secreted by prostate cancer cells. These observations illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining immune checkpoint blockade with MDSC-targeted therapies in the treatment of mCRPC.

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/03/16/systems-medicine-computing-state-body/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Genetic code&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Genomic-research-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Systems Medicine’ is a multidisciplinary field focused on unravelling, computing and integrating physiological and biochemical data, with the mission to develop a specially tailored system of information. As computer-based approaches become increasingly pervasive, not just in developed countries, but worldwide, the need to take physician-centred and patient-centred approaches in the design and development of this field becomes ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For roughly 50 years now, researchers and practitioners in computational and biomedical sciences have worked to formulate theory and practice that influences the direction of these approaches, and this diverse work makes up the field of Systems Medicine [1, 2]. Broadly speaking, it includes the study of what technology might be able to do for physicians and patients and how both parties might interact with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Good Practices are already in place, such as: the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), the E-Cell, as well as established educational curricula such as the MS Degree program in Georgetown University, USA and networking and society efforts, such as the European Association for Systems Medicine (EASyM) [3, 4, 5, 6]. This collection on ‘‘Systems Medicine’’ constitutes a significant milestone on an idea that stretches back through the vision posed by Allanson and Fairclough’s ‘‘A research agenda for physiological computing’’ [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of work planned in the thematic series is to provide a platform for a systemic approach, which avoids reductionism and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, immunological, gastrointestinal, etc.) [7, 8]. The results of any experiment require interpretation, especially when the data relate to systems as complex as living organisms. To be meaningful, the data has to fit within the family of ideas, principles or paradigms recognized by the field [9]. Biomedical data is most easily interpretable, for example, when it fits the expectations of a practicing physician, e.g. cardiologist; data that doesn’t fit these expectations often gets ignored [10]. Therefore, a computational reframing and establishment of good simulation practices, similar to the good clinical practices, will benefit medicine as a whole, if it allows physicians to incorporate into the field heretofore -unexpected or ill-fitting observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel character of computation in systems medicine seems to nurture the imagination and foster ingenuity. It is exhilarating to witness the inventiveness which is abundant in the biomedical computing field and the meaningful application of analysis tools that are being brought to bear on the fascinating challenges of the blend of medicine with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These editors’ writings have already helped me to get my bearings amid the concepts of digital health, orienting my perspective on even my own work. I look forward to furthering that educational process with the present volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would hence welcome submissions of original research articles (including systematic reviews and meta-analyses), but also methodology, software and database articles. This collection in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Systems Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will also include invited reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of manuscripts is 15th December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racism and prejudice are sometimes blatant, but often manifest in subtle ways. The current emblem of these subtle slights is the “microaggression”, a concept that has generated a large programme of research and launched itself into the popular consciousness – prompting last month’s decision by Merriam-Webster &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/microaggression-words-were-watching&quot;&gt;to add it to their dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new review in &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; by Scott Lilienfeld of Emory University argues that core empirical and conceptual questions about microaggressions remain unaddressed, meaning the struggle against them takes place on a confusing battlefield, one where it’s hard to tell between friend and foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20999&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a microaggression? First coined in the 1970s but rejuvenated in 2007 in a paper in the &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt; by Derald Wing Sue and colleagues, it originally referred only to racism but has expanded to a range of commonplace slights or hostility towards an oppressed group. The definition includes &lt;em&gt;microinvalidations&lt;/em&gt;, such as being told that a negative interaction couldn’t have been due to racist motives, and &lt;em&gt;microinsults&lt;/em&gt;, such as a teacher avoiding calling on you in class due to your gender, as well as a third class of &lt;em&gt;microassaults&lt;/em&gt;. The prototypical microaggression hides the offence within apparently innocent words or actions, which places those on the receiving end into a catch-22: swallow the indignity, or respond and risk being accused of overreaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems coherent on its face, but Lilienfeld argues there is an elastic nature to the definition, for example allowing Sue to assert that “the fact that psychological research has continued to inadequately address race and ethnicity…is in itself a microaggression.” In addition, items filed as microassaults include racial slurs and swastika graffiti; Lilienfeld argues that there is nothing micro about these events, so including them alongside the other examples muddies the waters and could spuriously make microaggressions appear culpable for harm, when the responsible party was old-fashioned abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that the edges of microaggression are poorly defined: ambiguity is baked into the entire concept. Advocates see this as a key feature, and claim that more ambiguous acts of prejudice are the most damaging, because they are the hardest to deal with – that aforementioned catch-22. (Sue again: “The invisibility of racial microaggressions may be more harmful to people of color than hate crimes or the covert and deliberate acts of White supremacists such as the Klan and Skinheads.”) Ambiguity can have its uses but the risk is that the concept becomes overly subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it could be that the experience of microaggressions is at least partially explained by a propensity to see fault or attack in statements. It could also be that the apparent impact of microaggressions on health or wellbeing is because people prone to negative emotionality (they score high on the trait of neuroticism) are more likely both to perceive microaggressions and to experience poorer health. One study did find an effect of microaggressions on negative moods and physical symptoms even after controlling for trait neuroticism, but the personality scale used in this study didn’t include any items related to proneness to feeling victimised, which seems an oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality having a hand in microaggression experience would also explain why some people from minority groups report no microaggressions when canvassed. The (limited) evidence that more ambiguous slights lead to more negative outcomes could also reflect the established psychological fact that in “weak” situations with no clear guidelines for action, people’s personality – in this case, their negative emotionality – tends to assert itself to fill in the interpretive gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilienfeld raises a lot of other issues we simply don’t have space for here: political assumptions, no measurement of base rates of everyday slights, inclusion criteria that limits participants to those who already buy into the concept to begin with, and the need to address whether people who commit microaggressions show other signs of a prejudicial mindset (something that research into the Implicit Affect test &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;has also struggled to demonstrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But he stresses that while he is not here to praise research into microaggression, nor is he here to bury it. He emphasises that many of these issues could be addressed by joining the microaggression field more closely with other more established areas of psychological research, and he offers a number of steps researchers could take to strengthen their research base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilienfeld also suggests we all consider putting aside the word microaggression in favour of “perceived racial slight” – because we don’t yet understand the role of interpretation due to personality, and because it simply isn’t clear that those using microaggressions are showing aggression as we usually understand the word. Putting aside the charged term, together with the “victim and perpetrator” parlance used by advocates and researchers, would allow us to affirm that these ambiguous events have a reality of their own, while recognising that the nature of that reality needs further investigation to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Conserving a behavior: a unique fish behaviour observed for the first – and last – time?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Grouper fig 1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-fig-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fishing for a unique behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well do we understand fish behaviour? Many fish species, in many habitats, have been extensively studied. Yet with the increasing impact of fishing and other human activities on the marine environment, we can question how much natural behaviour that would be observed in pristine environments has vanished from the areas we are actually able to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take fish mating behaviour. The classic pattern is of male and female fish gathering at spawning grounds, females releasing their eggs directly into the water, and males releasing their sperm to fertilise these eggs. Beyond these basic behaviours however, fish utilise a huge range of mating strategies, with individuals within a single species flexibly using different tactics depending on the situation and their own status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fish behave during mating will often depend on the density at which they gather at spawning grounds, with some mating tactics only seen when a considerable number of females have aggregated. Given how increasingly rare pristine spawning grounds are – especially for large, commercially fished species – we have to question how much mating behaviour we never see because these exploited species are never able to gather in sufficiently large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes research conducted on spawning aggregations in un-fished areas – if they can still be found – especially valuable, providing a critical opportunity to observe baseline behavior and determine what impact overfishing is having on natural mating practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the authors of an article &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0120-5&quot;&gt;recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to achieve. The researchers, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncf-india.org/people/rucha-karkarey&quot;&gt;Rucha Karkarey at the Nature Conservation Foundation in India&lt;/a&gt;, studied the squaretail grouper; a common species on coral reefs across the Indo-Pacific, very well studied, but heavily exploited by fisheries. With considerable effort, the researchers located an un-fished, pristine spawning ground and observed new mating behaviors never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8691&quot; style=&quot;width: 677px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A male grouper, showing the scars from past battles, guards his territory.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8691&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A male grouper, showing the scars from past battles, guards his territory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Rucha Karkarey&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Island Eden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted on Bitra, one of the most remote islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago, itself located a remote 400km south-west of the Indian coast. Bitra is a tiny island, home to just over 200 people, but crucially is surrounded by a substantial coral reef. Traditionally, local fishing has only been an artisanal enterprise, so the researchers hoped there was a good chance Bitra could be the place to observe an ‘untouched’ spawning aggregation of the squaretail grouper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on such a remote island was not without its challenges. The logistics of travelling to such a remote place and the difficulties of surveying the reefs meant it was several years before the researchers determined when the squaretail grouper gather to spawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific region, grouper spawn on the day of either the new moon or the full moon, depending on location and species. After several years of opportunistic surveys, and much questioning of local fishermen, the researchers determined that the new moon in January was when squaretailed groupers would gather in the largest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with this intelligence, the researchers set out to survey the reefs during the new moon of January in 2013 and 2014, hoping to see behavior never observed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moonless rendezvous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male grouper arrived at the spawning site up to three days before the new moon in order to establish territories. Females, easily distinguishable from males by their distended bellies, arrived the day prior to the new moon in large schools of 150-200 fish. After their arrival, the researchers surveyed the breeding ground through snorkelling and scuba diving, observing and videoing mating behaviours. As they had hoped, the grouper aggregation was substantial, containing the highest densities ever recorded for this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males made their territories on two types of habitat, either the slope of the reef or the reef shelf. Large males were much more common on the slope, with smaller males more likely to make their territories on the shelf; given the fierce competition between males to establish and defend territories, this implies that the reef slope provides the best mating grounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the majority of females gathered on the slope, where fish density was approx. six times higher than on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet unexpectedly, larger females seemed to prefer searching for mates among the smaller males on the reef shelf. Meanwhile, larger males on the slope were observed preferentially courting smaller females even when larger females were present. Among fish generally, it is common – and intuitive – for larger males to prefer larger females (who can produce more eggs) and vice versa. The inverse size-assortment seen in these large aggregations of grouper is a unique behaviour never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8690&quot; style=&quot;width: 648px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Courtship tactics. In image a. a school of females swim over the territory of a male. B. shows the 'traditional' pair-courtship behavior, as male displays to a female who has entered his territory. C &amp;amp; D show the newly observed school courtship behavior; two large males (circled in c.) make a foray into the female school, while in d. a group of females simultaneously spawn with a single male.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8690 size-full&quot; height=&quot;860&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Grouper-fig-1-full.jpg&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Courtship tactics. a. a school of females swim over a male’s territory. b. the ‘traditional’ pair-courtship behavior, as a male displays to a female who has entered his territory. c. &amp;amp; d. the newly observed school courtship behavior: two large males (circled in c.) make a foray into the female school, while in d. a group of females simultaneously spawn with a single male.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Karkarey et al. 2017&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just who the fish chose to mate with that surprised the researchers; &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they mated was unusual as well. The ‘classic’ squaretail grouper mating behaviour, commonly observed in other locations, is pair spawning. Here, a female will break away from her larger school and visit a male’s territory. The male courts her by approaching with a quivering motion, followed by a display of the underside of his body. If she’s impressed, the pair will release their eggs and sperm in a ‘spawning rush’ just above the male’s territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the large mating aggregations on the reefs around Bitra, the researchers also observed a second, never before seen, mating behaviour which they term ‘school-courtship’. Here, males made regular forays into the water above their territories, courting multiple females in a school before rapidly returning to their territory. This is distinct to the usual pair spawning in that it took place outside the male’s territory and involved a single male mating simultaneously with multiple females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the school-courtship strategy was very dependent on the size of a male and the location of its territory; only larger males with territories on the reef slope were observed using this novel tactic. For these males the tactic was highly successful, as they associated with three times more females than males using pair-courtship tactics. It came with a cost though; these males spent almost quadruple the time engaging in aggressive behaviour with other males to defend their territories. This newly discovered mating behavior seems to be very much a high-risk-high-reward tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above video shows an example of the unique school-spawning behavior. In the foreground, a male guards his territory in ‘traditional’ style. To the left, in the background, another male can be seen leaving his territory to make a foray into the school of females above. The male is seen courting multiple females in the school, followed by a sudden upward spawning rush between the male and 4–5 females from the school, proceeded by a release of gametes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paradise lost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the sting to this tale. During the course of their investigations, the researchers noted that a nascent but troubling commercial fishing industry had appeared on the reefs around Bitra. While not specifically targeting grouper, such an increase in fishing pressure clearly presents a threat to their breeding aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the researcher’s most recent data from 2015 and 2016 found an alarming 50% decline in peak aggregation compared to 2013 levels. Surveying the breeding schools in 2016 they were unable to observe a single instance of the novel school courtship behaviour. Is this unique behaviour to become extinct almost as soon as we have learnt of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the specific case of the squaretail grouper, these findings raise a wider concern about the perils of overfishing. Even if commercially exploited species are able to survive with sustainable populations (a big if for many species) we may still be eliminating unique and important behaviors that can only exist when fish are able to gather in large densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have potentially substantial effects on these species. In the squaretail grouper, the novel school-courtship behaviour is only used by the ‘best’ males (i.e. the largest individuals, able to obtain the best territories) and potentially substantially increases their mating success. This suggests that its elimination in overfished populations could have significant effects on the future demographics and evolution of the species. Even aside from this, isn’t there something tragic about seeing such unique and fascinating behaviour, the product of countless years of evolution, disappear from our oceans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope for the Bitra squaretail grouper. The researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncf-india.org/projects/aggregating-groupers&quot;&gt;presented their findings&lt;/a&gt; to the local community and sought their support in protecting the grouper. The response has been positive, with many even expressing a local pride that their island hosts an apparently unique natural phenomenon. With the cooperation of the Lakshadweep Fisheries Department and Administration they are attempting to establish a reserve that will ban commercial fishing in the grouper breeding areas in the few days around the January new moon. If these efforts are successful then perhaps the squaretail grouper will continue to display the full variety of their natural behaviour in at least one part of our vast oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: No WAVE, no reward: hope for addictive brains</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/PVqXQtEwm9A/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cocaine&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/03/Cocaine-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine is a common illicit drug of abuse which is able to strongly modify the brain. Cocaine-induced synaptic modifications are implicated in the neuronal adaptations underling addiction. Cocaine is able to increase the synaptic contents of dopamine (the “feel-good” chemical), by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) which is in charge for the synaptic re-uptake of the neurotransmitter. This massive increase in dopamine produces euphoria and pleasure. Despite several decades of efforts, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for cocaine-induced neuronal maladaptations are far from being completely understood and unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/6/1395.full.pdf&quot;&gt;PNAS article&lt;/a&gt;, the laboratory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2000/greengard-bio.html&quot;&gt;Paul Greengard&lt;/a&gt; (Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000) has revealed for the first time how a protein called WAVE1 is able to regulate the brain’s response to cocaine. Indeed, these results provide novel insights into the molecular functioning of the “addicted brain” and could lead to better interventions for treating addiction to cocaine and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We knew about the connection between WAVE1 and dopamine many years ago, but until now no one knew the mechanisms by which cocaine stimulates WAVE1 and how WAVE1 regulates cocaine’s actions&lt;/em&gt;” says Yong Kim, a Research Assistant Professor in Greengard’s lab and the senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the authors showed that WAVE1 was necessary to induce the rewarding and psychomotor effects of cocaine administration by knocking-down WAVE1 in the dopaminoceptive neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region highly involved in reward and motivation. However, it must be noted that the neurons of the NAc are not all the same. In fact, the nucleus accumbens is mainly composed of medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) which can be further subdivided depending on the expression of the dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) or the dopamine receptor 2 (D2R). We can then distinguish D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs. Surprisingly, cocaine-induced behavioral alterations were strongly reduced only when WAVE1 was genetically ablated in D1R-MSNs. However, this effect was not observed when WAVE1 was removed from cells containing the D2R, thus revealing new details about the neurobiological mechanisms of cocaine. In addition, the authors observed that WAVE1 phosphorylation was modulated by dopamine through its dopamine D1R receptor since pharmacological blockade of this specific receptor was able to block cocaine-induced WAVE1 post-translational modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this study also provides new evidence regarding the functional role of WAVE1 at the level of the brain’s synapses, the tiny junctions between neuronal cells through which impulses pass. The authors observed that WAVE1 activation is associated with morphological and functional decreases in excitatory synapses on specific D1R-MSNs. Importantly, “&lt;em&gt;certain polymorphisms in WAVE1 complex proteins in humans might contribute to vulnerability in functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses underlying addiction behavior such as cocaine craving and relapse&lt;/em&gt;”, say Ilaria Ceglia, the leading author of the study. Altogether the results suggest that this protein may play a critical role in providing a regulatory negative feedback at the level of specific excitatory synapses as a part of the cellular and molecular maladaptations induced by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It’s well known that cocaine increases the signaling of dopamine in the brain&lt;/em&gt;” Kim says. “&lt;em&gt;Understanding more about the mechanism of cocaine action is providing new insights into the neurobiology of addiction. Our eventual goal is to use these findings to find a way to develop a drug to treat addiction&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies will obviously be required to deeply understand all the molecular actors responsible for the psychostimulant effects induced by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this session, I will discuss dynamic report generation using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; (Sweave). &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; is an R package that enables R code integration into various markup languages such as LaTeX, HTML, Markdown etc. It can be used for writing research papers, theses, or even producing web-pages for presenting results. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; is valuable in scientific circles for several reasons. Beside allowing reports to be flexible and modified automatically, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; makes reproducible research simpler than manual approaches. When used properly, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; describes the steps of an experiment explicitly, and these steps are self-documented (by using R code). &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; itself is not complicated, however it does require some knowledge of the R language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be divided in two parts. In first part I will give a brief background to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt;. I will use second part of the talk to demonstrate several examples on how to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://yihui.name/knitr/&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; to make a (dynamic) research paper.&lt;/p&gt;
