Over recent years, the traditional Cornish fishing harbor town has become one of the countys most popular holiday destinations, helped in part by the establishment of a chain of business by celebrity chef Rick Stein and the popularity of the local area as a domestic UK holiday choice for people including the Prime Minister David Cameron and his family. However the tourist boom has had a downside for some residents, with second home buyers driving up property prices and forcing some local people away from the town.

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-31075-001&quot;&gt;have noticed&lt;/a&gt; that aspiring leaders generally pursue one of two different approaches for getting to the top of the social food-chain. Some people exert influence by building up skills or knowledge that command respect and deference from their peers – known as the prestige strategy. Others prefer to rule by fear instead, forcing others to fall into line – the dominance strategy. This dichotomy has even been suggested to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/&quot;&gt;account for the vastly different leadership styles&lt;/a&gt; of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many of the studies that have looked at the dynamics of prestige and dominance have done so in artificial social situations, examining groups of strangers brought together for a short time in the lab. So in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181621&quot;&gt;new study published open-access in &lt;i&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Charlotte Brand and Alex Mesoudi went out into the world and looked at how hierarchies based on prestige and dominance affected the behaviour of real social groups.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37311&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 30 community groups from Cornwall, each made up of 5 individuals and ranging from choirs to chess clubs (my favourites include a band known as Falmouth Fish Sea Shanty Collective, and a group of board game creators called Pirates of Penryn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed a 40-item quiz covering topics like art and geography, first individually and then together with their group. The groups were told they had to come to an agreement on each answer, and the group that scored the highest overall would win £500. Finally, each individual cast an anonymous vote for the group member they wanted to represent them in a set of bonus quiz questions which could win them even more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also rated each member of their group on prestige (e.g. “Members of your group respect and admire them”), dominance (e.g. “They are willing to use aggressive tactics to get their way”), their likability, and how much influence they had during the quiz and in the group generally. Thankfully for the enduring survival of the groups, these ratings were all anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within groups, individuals who had more influence were more likely to be rated as highly prestigious or highly dominant, consistent with previous research suggesting that both strategies can be used to gain status in social groups. Dominance and prestige ratings were not related to each other, again in-line with findings that the two strategies are quite distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But intriguingly, neither dominance nor prestige ratings determined whether someone would be elected to take the bonus quiz – even though prestige in particular is thought to be closely tied to having superior knowledge. Instead, elected representatives tended to be those who had scored highly during the individual quiz, suggesting that the other group members had picked upon their expertise in this specific context, and made a pragmatic decision based on this, rather than being swayed by people’s status in the group more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings contrast with previous studies that suggested prestige has a greater influence over group behaviour. They perhaps illustrate the pitfalls of performing social psychology studies solely in the lab: in natural groups, where individuals have had the chance to interact and establish hierarchies over long periods of time, group dynamics may be quite different to those among strangers who have just met. Of course, a selection of community groups from Cornwall is still not necessarily representative of the wider population, and it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of prestige and dominance in more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when it comes to groups in the real world, the authors say, “prestige and dominance may be more domain-specific, or more fixed, than we had anticipated”. For example, group members may have gained their prestige because of a specific skillset – perhaps they were particularly good at singing or making board games – which was less useful for the general knowledge quiz.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This study shows that running on the ground naturally stimulates a flapping motion in feathered forelimbs, and suggests that this flap may be the origin of avian flight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Author Zhao explains: “Our work shows that the motion of flapping feathered wings was developed passively and naturally as the dinosaur ran on the ground…although this flapping motion could not lift the dinosaur into the air at that time, the motion of flapping wings may have developed earlier than gliding.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216362&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; from PLOS ONE found that that in a test room set to temperatures ranging from 16.19 C/61.14 F -32.57 C/90.63 F, female study participants performed best on math and verbal tests at the higher end of the temperature range, while male participants performed most strongly on the same tests at lower temperatures. This is the first experimental research supporting anecdotal and survey responses indicating women tend to prefer warmer room temperatures than men, by showing that temperatures can affect both comfort and performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Authors Kajackaite and Chang summarize: “In a large laboratory experiment, over 500 individuals performed a set of cognitive tasks at randomly manipulated indoor temperatures. Consistent with their preferences for temperature, for both math and verbal tasks, women perform better at higher temperatures while men perform better at lower temperatures.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A 2016 mass die-off of puffins and other seabirds in the Bering Sea is reported in a new PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216532&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;by Timothy Jones of the citizen science program COASST at University of Washington, Lauren Divine from the Aleut Community of St Paul Island Ecosystem Conservation Office, and colleagues. Up to 8,500 puffins and auklets may have died in this event, which appeared to be due to starvation; the authors suggest that climate shifts may have resulted in a lack of prey.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Author Rachel Dale notes: “This study shows that domestication did not necessarily make dogs more prosocial. Rather, it seems that tolerance and generosity towards group members help to produce high levels of cooperation, as seen in wolves.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Becerril-García believes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is undesirable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Heeded and acted upon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11&quot;&gt;rumour on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on open access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in &lt;i&gt;vis-à-vis&lt;/i&gt; the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaemex.mx/&quot;&gt;UAEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

Redalyc has developed technology to strengthen and provide visibility to journals in the region. Currently, there are 1,305 journals and upwards of 650,000 full-text articles available on the platform from which more than 100 million texts are downloaded per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Redalyc provides an indexing system. To be accepted for inclusion in the index, journals first have to go through a rigorous quality evaluation process. We also offer services to complement what journals provide on their own websites – e.g. tools to enable journals to generate XML that is compliant with ANSI/NISO JATS standards and to provide PDF, HTML and ePUB reading formats, as well as an article interactive reader for reading articles on desktop computers as well as on mobile devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also provide interoperability and search engine optimisation services to enable the journals to be transparently integrated with the Directory of Open Access Journals (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;DOAJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; and hundreds of content aggregators and libraries all around the world.

From where I stand the situation is more complex, and even more complex when we observe the different regional contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We know that before the Second World War the participation of commercial publishers was limited, and journals depended mostly on professional associations. In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;the oligopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;amp;Src=IP&amp;amp;Alias=WOK5&quot;&gt;Web of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scopus.com/&quot;&gt;Scopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Consequently, researchers are forced to publish in journals owned by commercial publishers who are mainly based outside the region, and in order to make their work open access they now have to pay an APC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of AmeliCA is to support and consolidate a native model that has operated in Latin America for more than 30 years, a model in which the publishing process is financed in a structured and rooted manner with public resources provided via local universities. This is the starting point and our aim is to demonstrate that different models of scholarly publishing have developed than one controlled by commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What has also been happening in our region recently is that journals that have been locally founded and developed – with public resources – and then internationalised, are being acquired by commercial publishers; there are several examples where the publisher is not an academic publisher anymore. These are journals that were created and consolidated with public resources, and then supported by Redalyc for years in order to attain international visibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our view is that this kind of appropriation, and the considerable restrictions researchers now face in order to share, process and publish their work open access, among many other characteristics of the models used by big commercial publishers, are unacceptable for the development of science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The commercial strategies that for-profit publishers have adopted for open access are ravenous, exclusionary and unsustainable.

For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm&quot;&gt;BBB definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A clear example of this can be seen at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unlp.edu.ar/&quot;&gt;National University of La Plata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; in Argentina. There you can see a very strong, determined, and prepared group already using AmeliCA’s technology to sustain its journals and prevent the implementation of APCs, or the intervention of commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This group is composed of researchers and students and they are being trained in publishing matters in order to sustain the work in the future. Everything is financed with resources from the university and supported by the infrastructure and technology that AmeliCA offers and that Redalyc developed over many years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: AmeliCA is focused primarily on Latin America. More recently, UNESCO announced the launch of the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;. This brings together the coordinators of six platforms: AmeliCA, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajol.info/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;AJOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;É&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;rudit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/&quot;&gt;J-STAGE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openedition.org/?lang=en&quot;&gt;OpenEdition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scielo.org/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, with the aim “to democratize scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”. Aside from the geographical spread of the participants, and the emphasis on language diversity of GLOALL, what distinguishes its aims from those of AmeliCA and Plan S? Is GLOALL more about &lt;/i&gt;articulating&lt;i&gt; an alternative vision to Plan S or are there real-life &lt;/i&gt;practical initiatives&lt;i&gt; planned? If so, what kind of initiatives?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLOALL, in my view, offers the potential for great platforms to work together to create a non-commercial open access future. This need not explicitly oppose commercial publishers but could work from another point of view, one that conceives knowledge as a public common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I should stress that this is my personal view. GLOALL is a new initiative and the scope has yet to be defined. We know that we share common goals and that these need to be realised in the form of policies, projects and strategies, and to be focused on achieving open access aligned with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;established in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/sustainable-development/SDGs/index_en.htm&quot;&gt;United Nations 2030 Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA will willingly share its technology and experience with GLOALL members, and with any region that wishes to strengthen the model we believe in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Three weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://africanopenscience.org.za/&quot;&gt;African Open Science Platform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;joined with cOAlition S (the group of funders behind Plan S) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/&quot;&gt;OA2020&lt;/a&gt; (a European initiative with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/oa2020-and-coalition-s/&quot;&gt;same goals as Plan S&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on Open Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; This was done at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/news/2019-annual-meeting-sao-paulo/&quot;&gt;annual meetin&lt;/a&gt;g &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of the Global Research Council (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/&quot;&gt;GRC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Can you say how this statement came about (i.e. who approached whom?) and how the statement fits with the goals of AmeliCA and GLOALL? How difficult was it to arrive at wording that all sides could agree on? What are the next steps if any?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The question is wrongly posed: AmeliCA didn’t join with either cOAlition S or with OA2020. AmeliCA was invited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/&quot;&gt;Science Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to participate in an event. Several other platforms were invited and together we signed a statement reaffirming the common goal we all share of freeing knowledge from paywalls. This is the goal of dozens and hundreds of platforms. The São Paulo Statement does no more than state that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our concern is not over the goals of Plan S but how they are implemented. The purpose of the meeting we had with the Plan S architects was to discuss that. And at that meeting, I explained our stance (as discussed in the previous questions). I also presented our stance publicly in a panel held at the GRC event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aside from stating that we reject the APC model, I mentioned in that meeting the risk of disrupting the Latin American system by implementing a Eurocentric model, and I resolutely asked why institutions and governments in Latin America would be motivated to continue subsidising scholarly publishing if strategies are put in place that will end up driving more public money to commercial enterprises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I pointed out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. And I asked: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have repeatedly expressed our concerns about Plan S. Now we are waiting for cOAlition S to announce its final implementation plans. We hope that the feedback phase has been useful, and that cOAlition S will adjust their strategy to enable an inclusive, participative open access model to be developed, one in which non-profit scholarly communication is taken into account when financial resources are distributed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If they don’t, Plan S will only further weaken those publishing activities that are still in the control of the academy, and strengthen commercial publishers – to the point perhaps where the former will disappear altogether. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA’s goals are crystal clear: we want scholarly publishing to be in the hands of the academy – universities and professional associations. In other words, to continue working in the way that Redalyc has been working for decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: The wording of the São Paulo Statement is very general and does not specify much in the way of practical action. As you will know, cOAlition S has been struggling to get global buy-in for Plan S, and has attracted criticism in the Global South for attempting to foist a one-size-fits-all Eurocentric model (as you call it) of scholarly publishing on the world. I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement? What benefits do you think signing it might bring to the Global South?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Scholarly publishing is a global ecosystem that already exists. Consequently, for a proposal to be established as global, and for everyone’s benefit, all countries and institutions need to participate in the discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would highlight several points about which I believe there is agreement in the South, although with some nuances: the present model is unsustainable, and knowledge must be freed from paywalls. Every stakeholder agrees with this other than those who benefit from the way things currently are. The only point of disagreement, as I said, is over how open access is achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the South, Redalyc, AmeliCA, CLACSO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latindex.org/latindex/inicio&quot;&gt;Latindex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lareferencia.info/en/&quot;&gt;LaReferencia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (amongst others) have &lt;a href=&quot;http://reuniondeconsorcios.conricyt.mx/index.php/primera-reunion/declaraciones/?lang=en&quot;&gt;expressed their strong objection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to the APC model. And I expressed this clearly and vehemently at São Paolo, so I hope that the final implementation guidelines will demonstrate that cOAlition S has listened to the feedback it has received and is prepared to provide resources for non-profit players. Here I am thinking of non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools. If this happens then our engaging with cOAlition S will have led to something positive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if Plan S ends up dismantling the current harmful system for evaluating research and researchers based on the false prestige bestowed on publications by the Impact Factor – as called for by the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – there is no doubt that the South would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As to any PR benefits the São Paulo Statement may have: I wouldn’t like to think the meeting was only undertaken for media purposes. In signing the statement, we wanted to give a vote of confidence to the notion that communication and feedback between the North and South is a good thing. Plan S and the general public know AmeliCA’s principles and values. We unwaveringly affirm them and will keep working towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I believe AmeliCA plans to publish a public response to the São Paulo Statement.

However, I would stress that several platforms signed it, some of which AmeliCA and Redalyc distance themselves from completely. It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together with other institutions AmeliCA and Redalyc are working towards, and hope to further, non-commercial open access (as I have explained) and we resolutely support DORA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal. I would, however, note that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – another regional initiative in Latin America – has signed an agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/&quot;&gt;Clarivate Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. In doing so they have chosen a different route, one that legitimises the Impact Factor as a way of ranking the importance of journals. They have also chosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/products/scholarone/&quot;&gt;ScholarOne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (which is a proprietary Clarivate Analytics product) as their publishing platform in Brazil, rather than the open source software Open Journal Systems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;OJS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; developed by Public Knowledge Project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;PKP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;.

We are all waiting for news from Plan S about that. Let’s see how they’ve enriched their understanding and stance after the multiple conversations they have had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Terribly alarming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I sometimes think that OA advocates in the global North have spent 17-odd years working towards a solution that (as AmeliCA puts it) “simply aims to regulate commercial agreements” and are now realising that this approach is creating a system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberquarterly.eu/article/10.18352/lq.10280/&quot;&gt;no more financially sustainable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; than the subscription system. Would you agree? If so, how can this be resolved at this point in time? Might it be too late?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; If the focus of any new initiative is on replacing the model of paying-to-read with one based on paying-to-publish, it will inevitably create an unsustainable and non-inclusive system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is clear is that at this point in time the control of scholarly publishing is in the hands of commercial publishers, and so any planned change must necessarily include them. However, in the process of change control needs to be transferred to academia – to academic institutions, to universities, to academic associations, and to other stakeholders whose focus is on the development of science rather than promoting private commercial interests. And if this is done in a collective manner and in a distributed and fair way the value and power of scholarly communication can be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means building infrastructure, taking advantage of the great benefits that communication and information technologies now offer, professionalising institutions so that they can create a publishing tradition, and anything else that can further the task of taking back control of scholarly communication which is currently dominated by private interests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As things stand, the South cannot escape the perversion of the system. It saddens us to see how more and more national systems of journal assessment disqualify local journals if they don’t rank in the first quartiles of Scopus or Web of Science, no matter how much they have contributed to the history and problem solving of the discipline or region concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a consequence, local journals are now receiving fewer direct resources. And they are receiving fewer contributions because researchers are discouraged from publishing in them. Researchers are discouraged because local journals do not fulfil the requirements needed to be considered “mainstream”, and researchers’ salaries and incentives depend on being published in mainstream journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has happened in Colombia, in Mexico and in many other countries. The agreements between SciELO and Clarivate Analytics, the appropriation of journals by commercial publishers, the hiring of SpringerOpen by public universities to dictate how and where to publish, the list of such examples is vast. Right now, we are looking at an ecosystem at risk of total collapse. And that is terribly alarming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Million-dollar question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Is it in your view possible to build a global system of scholarly communication (and an open-access infrastructure) able to meet the needs of all countries in a fair and equitable way, both countries &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in the Global South and those in the Global North?

Thank you for asking, and for thinking that I could provide even the draft of an answer. Undoubtedly, that is what we all want, and because of that we gather together and debate the issue. But let me share my viewpoint on that with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to start by asking: what science communication model or paradigm can be considered a suitable one for humanity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not necessarily a matter of South or North. We must go back to basics and recover the essence of what science communication is and should be. Is it to communicate research, and to do so to the limit of what is possible in order to attain the greatest efficacy and efficiency in putting scientific and technological advances at society’s disposal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We must remind ourselves that the goal of publishing is to make our research available for the public, to submit findings to public scrutiny, and to do so in a way that allows everyone to access knowledge without restriction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to facilitate a global conversation that focuses on both the large and small problems humanity faces and to ensure that all researchers are able to participate in that conversation, not only those who can pay to take part in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current information technologies enable us to rethink what is now taken for granted. We can deconstruct what we know does not work and we can decide what engine is needed to further the agendas and work of researchers. And we can be more creative in planning how to distribute resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many efforts have been made to do this around the world, there hasn’t yet been enough determination and resources put into uniting these isolated and disparate efforts. Open access and scholarly communication find themselves at a key historical moment and we are now in a position, and have a great opportunity, to redraw the system of scholarly communication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I imagine a web of data for science, a knowledge cloud – sustainable and open – that promotes a participatory and inclusive science communication system, one in which every institution that is generating knowledge is able to connect it into a giant graph of knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to do that I strongly believe that academic institutions must not only be the generators – as it were – of this asset, but also the owners and transmitters of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for answering my questions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world with magic, how much effort do you think it would take to cast a spell to make a frog appear out of nowhere? What about to turn a frog invisible? Or make it levitate? And would it be easier to levitate a frog than a cow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers John McCoy and Tomer Ullman recently put such questions to hundreds of participants across three studies and found they were in remarkable agreement. The findings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217513&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217513&quot;&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; suggest that we invoke our intuitive understanding of the physical world – our “folk physics” – to make sense of imaginary worlds. And they help explain why fantasy TV shows and books can lose their magic as soon as it feels like anything goes. “Superman leaps tall buildings in a single bound, but a building takes more sweat than an ant-hill,” the researchers said. “And even for Superman, leaping to Alpha Centauri is simply silly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37308&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of three studies, McCoy and Ullman asked over 200 online participants (aged 18 to 83) to imagine a world in which wizards cast spells and to rank 10 spells in order of how much effort they would require. There was striking agreement across the participants that the easiest spell would be one that changed a frog’s colour and the hardest would be to conjure a frog into existence. In between, from easiest to hardest, the participants ranked the other spells as follows: levitate; teleport; make bigger; turn invisible; turn to stone; split into two frogs; transform to a mouse; and make cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study with nearly 400 participants was similar but this time some of the participants considered the same spells but applied to a cow, or involving a greater distance than before (for instance, levitating a frog 100 feet off the ground rather than one foot). Also, this time the participants specified how many magic points would be required for each spell (providing a continuous measure of perceived effort), and the researchers converted their estimates to rank the different spells in order of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, there was striking agreement among participants in the relative effort required for the different spell types. For instance, the conjure spell was seen as about four times more taxing than the levitate spell. And there was agreement that the same spell type would require more effort when applied to a cow than a frog, and when greater distances were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these two studies and a third (a direct replication of the second involving 600 participants), the researchers also assessed the participants’ familiarity with fantasy and magic in books, TV, movies and games. There was no evidence that exposure to fantasy and magic made any difference to participants’ estimates of the difficulty of the spells, ruling out “cultural learning” as an influence on the judgments. “We suggest that the  media does not primarily affect what spells are seen as more difficult, but rather than people bring their intuitive physics to bear when they engage with fiction,” McCoy and Ullman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the pair note that the spells that were consistently judged most effortful – conjure, and cause to cease to exist – “… violate object permanence and cohesion, which are the earliest developing principles at the core of object understanding.” That is, even babies would have the intuition to recognise that something magical was going on if a frog suddenly appeared or disappeared out of nowhere. At the other extreme, the spells judged easiest, such as changing a frog’s colour or levitating it, “…change only accidental object properties such as location and colour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with US participants – it will be interesting to see if and how these findings differ in other cultures. For now, though, the results help explain why fantasy is most enjoyable when it is rooted in reality. The researchers conclude by citing the novelist George Macdonald: “The natural world has its laws, and no man must interfere with them … but they themselves may suggest laws of other kinds, and man may,  if he pleases, invent a little world of his own” – to which McCoy and Ullman add “It seems people’s little worlds do not stray far from home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217513&quot;&gt;Judgments of effort for magical violations of intuitive physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drtimlomas.com&quot;&gt;Tim Lomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novelist David Foster Wallace famously told a story of two young fish swimming in the sea, whereby an older fish glides by and asks, “how’s the water?”, to which they look at each other in puzzlement and say, “What’s water?” The central point of the parable is that we are constantly immersed in contexts to which we give little thought or consideration, but which nevertheless influence us profoundly. Among the most powerful of such contexts is language. A century of research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis (LHR; also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) has shown that the language we speak profoundly affects our experience and understanding of life, impacting everything from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/&quot;&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt; of time and space to the construction of our self-identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might the implications of the LHR be for psychology itself? As a science, the field generally aims to be neutral and objective, and to discover universal truths about the human mind. Yet it is surely consequential that the field mostly conducts its business in English, this being the default language in international journals and conferences. For instance, if a phenomenon has not been identified in English – even if it has in other languages – it is unlikely to be a topic of concern, and may not even “exist” for English-speaking scholars at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that the field has sought to address this limitation is by “borrowing” words from other languages and cultures.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To ascertain the extent of this cross-cultural borrowing, I analysed a sample of words in psychology and recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1615107&quot;&gt;published my results in the Journal of Positive Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37301&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on my own specialism of wellbeing and in particular on a seminal article from positive psychology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-13324-001&quot;&gt;published in American Psychologist&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 by Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which inaugurated this emergent field. My approach was to identify the etymology of every word in the main text of the article using the online etymology dictionary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etymonline.com&quot;&gt;www.etymonline.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My findings reveal the diverse etymological roots of psychology, and of English more broadly. Of the 1333 distinct lexemes (words and their variants) in the article, ‘native’ English words – belonging either to the Germanic languages from which English emerged, or originating as neologisms in English itself – comprise only 39.4 per cent of the sample. Thus, over 60 per cent of the article’s words are loanwords, borrowed from other languages at some point in the development of English. This is higher than analyses of the percentage of borrowed words in English for other categories of phenomena, such as religion and belief (41 per cent), clothing and grooming (39), the body (14), spatial relations (14) and sense perception (11), and in English as a whole (estimated at between 32 and 41 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt; text, the largest contributor of loan words is Latin (44.5 per cent) – which frequently arrived via French following the Norman conquest of 1066 – followed by French itself (7 per cent) and Greek (7 per cent), with the remainder provided by modern German (0.7 per cent), Old Norse (0.5 per cent), Italian (0.4 per cent), and Arabic, Dutch, and Scottish (all 0.1 per cent). Moreover, of the words treated as English in origin, 52.1 per cent are neologisms created from other languages (mainly Latin and Greek). If such words were also deemed loanwords (or at least, loan adaptations), the number of borrowed words rises to 70 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may wonder &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; psychology has borrowed so many words. Sometimes borrowing reflects the importation of new psychological theories and practices. One example is “psychoanalysis” (coined by Freud as &lt;i&gt;psychische analyse&lt;/i&gt;, before being rendered in French as &lt;i&gt;psychoanalyse&lt;/i&gt; then Anglicised in 1906). Other borrowed words articulate phenomena of which English speakers may already have known but not yet named or conceptualised, hence the ready adoption of terms to allow such vocalisation. For instance, behaviours we would identify as altruistic presumably occurred throughout the centuries. However, the term “altruism” was not coined until the 1830s – in French as &lt;i&gt;altruisme&lt;/i&gt; by the philosopher August Comte, based on &lt;i&gt;autrui&lt;/i&gt;, meaning of or to others – and soon after entered English.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By borrowing words from other languages, psychology and our understanding of life become more nuanced and enriched. In that respect, psychology would surely do well to go further, and more consciously and actively engage with non-English languages and cultures. Indeed, this is one aim of my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drtimlomas.com/lexicography&quot;&gt;lexicographic project&lt;/a&gt;, which involves collecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/28/there-are-at-least-216-foreign-words-for-positive-emotional-states-and-concepts-that-we-dont-have-in-english/&quot;&gt;“untranslatable” words relating to wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., words without an exact equivalent in English). This is an evolving and collaborative work-in-progress, which currently includes nearly 1200 words, around half of which are crowd-sourced suggestions to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key premise of the project is that the augmentation of English over the centuries has been a haphazard and arbitrary process – shaped especially by conceptual innovation in the “classical” world (particularly Greece around the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries BCE, and the Roman empire between the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries), and by the vicissitudes of geopolitical power (notably the invasion by Germanic tribes in the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and the Norman conquest in the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century). By contrast, English – and psychology too therefore – has largely overlooked the conceptual and lexical innovations made in more distant cultures. There are exceptions though, such as the fruitful engagement by psychology with mindfulness, derived from a Buddhist concept and practice known in Pāli as &lt;i&gt;sati&lt;/i&gt;, which illustrates the great value of this kind of cross-cultural engagement.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project therefore proposes that the field can engage with non-English ideas and practices in a much more inclusive and systematic way (including, of course, through collaboration and co-production with scholars from the cultures in question). Through this and other such endeavours, we can continue to add to the melting pot of ideas, helping the field to continue to develop over the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>NeuroFedora blog: Keeping software in NeuroFedora up to date</title>
	<link>https://neurofedora.github.io/2019/06/06/keeping-software-in-neurofedora-up-to-date.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Given the large number of software updates we published recently, we thought
this is a good chance to explain how the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team (and the Fedora
package maintainers team in general) stays on top of all of this software that
is constantly being updated and improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/PackageMaintainerFlowChart.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Simplified schematic of the package maintenance workflow in Fedora&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/PackageMaintainerFlowChart.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the (simplified) figure shows, there is a well defined process to ensure
that we keep our software in good shape---updating it all in a timely manner.
The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://apps.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Fedora Infrastructure team&lt;/a&gt; maintains
lots of tools to enable the community in this aspect too, and all of these
tools continuously evolve as the community moves to newer directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sections below, we go over the process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;upstream-releases-a-new-version&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Upstream releases a new version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with &lt;em&gt;upstream&lt;/em&gt; releasing a new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upstream&lt;/em&gt; are the developers of the software. We at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; (and most
Linux distributions) are &lt;em&gt;downstream&lt;/em&gt;: we take developed software, build and
integrate it all, and provide it in easily installable &lt;em&gt;packages&lt;/em&gt; to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Fedora, these packages are provided as &lt;code&gt;rpm&lt;/code&gt; archives via the
repositories. Other distributions may use other formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anitya&lt;/strong&gt;  runs at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://release-monitoring.org&quot;&gt;https://release-monitoring.org&lt;/a&gt; and monitors upstream for
new versions.  &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/release-monitoring/anitya&quot;&gt;Anitya&lt;/a&gt; is
able to monitor different upstream release methods such as Github, PyPi,
Sourceforge, Gitlab, and so on.  When Anitya detects a new version it first
checks to see what version of this software we are currently providing in
Fedora. If it sees that the Fedora version is older than the new upstream
version that it has detected, it files a bug on our community bug tracker at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com&quot;&gt;https://bugzilla.redhat.com&lt;/a&gt; notifying the maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIP: you can use the Fedora packages application at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages&quot;&gt;https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages&lt;/a&gt; to search the full list of software
that is currently included in Fedora. If you already know the name of the
package, you can use &lt;code&gt;https://bugz.fedoraproject.org/&amp;lt;package name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
(replace &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;package name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the name of the package, such as
&lt;code&gt;nest&lt;/code&gt;) to go straight to a package's summary page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;maintainers-test-and-update-the-fedora-package&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Maintainers test and update the Fedora package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bugzilla.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot: Anitya files a bug notifying the maintainers&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bugzilla.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the bug has been filed, the next steps require manual work. There are
tools to make it all easier, but this is where we humans come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora package maintainers&lt;/a&gt; notices the bug and begins
to work on it. All notifications from bugzilla are sent to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/neuro-sig@lists.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;neuro-sig
mailing list&lt;/a&gt;,
so the team is usually always aware of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we fetch the new source code and test it to see how it has changed in
the new release. Is it a minor release with bug-fixes and enhancements, or is
it a major release where lots of functionality has changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, especially with development libraries, there are API/ABI changes
that make the new version incompatible with the older ones. In such cases, we
have to see how &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other software that depends on these is affected.  This
is documented in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/&quot;&gt;community policy on updating software&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is
that when new versions of software are released, as package maintainers, one of
our duties is to ensure that the new versions do not break existing
systems for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is software that does not work with the latest versions, we
maintainers try to help developers update their code. Here are some examples
where we've notified maintainers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/145&quot;&gt;Neuron: use newer libstdc++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/113&quot;&gt;Neuron: use a more recent SUNDIALS version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues/627&quot;&gt;VXL: use newer openjpeg2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues/550&quot;&gt;VXL: use newer DCMTK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When possible, we do try to provide patches and open pull requests. However,
this depends on how much time we maintainers have and of course, it also
depends on the complexity of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/pull/86&quot;&gt;libNeuroML: tweaks to manifest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/genesis-sim/genesis-2.4/pull/3&quot;&gt;genesis: update scripts to use python3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, &lt;strong&gt;we try to stay as close to upstream as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. This page
lists the advantages of doing so:
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects&quot;&gt;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3a. Maintainers update the spec file and build new rpms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything seems to work fine after we've managed to fix any issues, we
begin to update the Fedora package. The first step here is to update the &lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt;
file. The &lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt; file resides in the package's dist-git repository on
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/&quot;&gt;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/&lt;/a&gt; where other Fedora tools can access it.
When this has been updated to build the newest release, we queue up a new build
on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/&quot;&gt;Koji build system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt; files provide instructions that tell the &lt;code&gt;rpmbuild&lt;/code&gt; tool how to
build the software, and where all its files should go in the &lt;code&gt;rpm&lt;/code&gt;
package. More information on the process can be found &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Package_Maintainers#Introduction_to_packaging&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
You can see a relatively simple &lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt; file for &lt;code&gt;python-indexed_gzip&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-indexed_gzip/blob/master/f/python-indexed_gzip.spec&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nest/blob/master/f/nest.spec&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt;
for the &lt;code&gt;nest&lt;/code&gt; simulator, however, is a lot more complex since we must
build it with MPI support also. If you want to see a real scary &lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt; file,
though, look at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/texlive/blob/master/f/texlive.spec&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for
the &lt;code&gt;texlive&lt;/code&gt; package. It is auto generated from the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;texlive&lt;/a&gt; sources, but you can imagine how hard it must
be to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-koji.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot: A package maintainer queues up a new build.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-koji.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build system handles all our supported arches unless told not to do so.
Currently, the Fedora community supports: &lt;code&gt;x86_64, i686, armv7hl,
aarch64, ppc64le, s390x&lt;/code&gt;. More information on these architectures can be found
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;quality-assurance-the-community-tests-the-updated-packages&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Quality assurance: the community tests the updated packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the builds have completed successfully, we push the builds to our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA&quot;&gt;Quality
Assurance&lt;/a&gt; pipeline for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bodhi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot: The Bodhi QA system manages our updates and their testing.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bodhi.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't enough to get the software to build correctly. We must also ensure
that it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; correctly.  The pipeline lets community members (including
users) &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; these updated packages in a &lt;em&gt;staging repository&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can help test these updates.&lt;/em&gt; All you need to do is install them, and
provide feedback. This is all explained &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bodhi-ind.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot: An update on Bodhi that has been pushed to stable.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/20190603-indexed-gzip-bodhi-ind.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the packages pass the community's battery of automated checks, and testers
provide positive feedback on their functioning, they are then moved from the
staging repositories to the &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; repositories where they are available to
all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These general steps are not limited to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team. They are followed
by all &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_what_is_fedora_all_about&quot;&gt;Fedora community&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers&quot;&gt;package maintainers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-community-uses-develops-extends-shares-their-work&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The community uses/develops/extends/shares their work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all this is done and the packages available to install via the different
package management tools (&lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;/Gnome-software/DNFDragora/Discover),
other community members are able to use, develop, extend, share and do more
with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like to use the word &quot;users&quot; because unlike let's say Nvidia who is a
&quot;vendor&quot; and provides software to its &quot;users&quot;, Fedora is a community with a
large portion of people using our software also helping maintain and develop
it. Everyone who uses Fedora is already a community member, for they help us
achieve our goal---to spread Free/Open source software and awareness about it.
This is perhaps worth a whole post in itself, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;join-the-community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Join the community!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since community projects aren't profit focussed, instead of money, the resource
we most need is man-power. Each new contributor increases the sum total man-power
possessed by the community and this enables us to work with more software, help
more developers, improve all of this software in general---get more work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've gotten this far, you would have probably realised that there is quite
a bit of work to be done, and there are ample opportunities where you can help
in this area of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;/Fedora.  You can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggest software for inclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package and maintain software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test packaged software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file bugs and report issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help maintain the tools that are required to keep the community ticking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on all of this is included in our documentation &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/contributing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The
easiest way, though, is probably just to have a chat with the team. Catch us
anytime on our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is an old favourite – if you could travel back in time, what advice would you give to your younger self? Yet despite the popularity of this thought experiment, no one has, until now, actually studied what people would tell themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2019.1609401&quot;&gt;Reporting their findings in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2019.1609401&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Robin Kowalski and Annie McCord at Clemson University have done just that in two surveys of hundreds of participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. Their findings show that people’s advice to their younger selves is overwhelmingly focused on prior relationships, educational opportunities and personal worth, echoing similar results derived from research into people’s most common regrets in life. Moreover, participants who said they had followed the advice they would give to their younger selves were more likely to say that they had become the kind of person that their younger self would admire. “…[W]e should consult ourselves for advice we would offer to our younger selves,” the researchers said. “The data indicate that there is much to be learned that can facilitate wellbeing and bring us more in line with the person that we would like to be should we follow that advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37287&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two studies followed a similar format with the participants (selected to be aged at least 30 years) asked to provide either three pieces or one piece of advice to their younger selves; to reflect on whether following this advice would help them become more like the person they aspire to be or ought to be; whether they had actually followed the advice later in life; to consider a pivotal event that had shaped them in life, especially in light of the advice they’d chosen to give their younger selves; and to reflect on what their younger self would make of their current self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants mostly gave themselves advice around relationships (“Don’t marry her. Do. Not. Marry. Her.”), education (“Go to college”), selfhood (“Be yourself”), direction and goals (“Keep moving, keep taking chances, and keep bettering yourself”), and money (“Save more, spend less”). These topics closely match &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394712/&quot;&gt;the most common topics mentioned in research on people’s regrets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most participants said that the advice they offered was tied to a pivotal event in their past, such as a time they were bullied, a relationship breakup, or an incident involving drink or drugs, and about half the time they had regret for what had happened. The timing of these pivotal events was most commonly between age 10 and 30 (consistent with research into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/09/what-your-choice-of-best-ever-footballer-says-about-human-memory/&quot;&gt;reminiscence bump&lt;/a&gt; – the way that we tend to recall more autobiographical memories from our teens and early adulthood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over half the participants in both studies said that they had since followed the advice that they would offer to their younger selves. The majority of participants also said that following the advice would have brought their younger self closer to the kind of person they aspired to be, rather than making them more like their “ought self” (that is, the kind of person that other people or society said they should be). Finally, as mentioned, participants who said they’d followed their own advice (to their younger selves) were more likely to say that their younger high-school self would have respect for the person they had now grown into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is preliminary research on an unexplored topic and it’s possible the results might differ in other cultures and using other methods of collecting people’s reflections. However, the work lays the foundation for further questions, such as: how the advice we give our past selves might vary in quantity and kind as we get older; and how following the advice might affect our emotions and hope for the future. “This initial foray into advice to one’s younger self clearly raises so many interesting research questions, many of which will hopefully be examined in months and years to come,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2019.1609401&quot;&gt;If I knew then what I know now: Advice to my younger self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open and Shut?: Why did Riksbankens Jubileumsfond decide to leave cOAlition S?</title>
	<link>https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span&gt;Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Image Simeon87 &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home&quot;&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; of protest being launched. &lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/&quot;&gt;revised guidelines&lt;/a&gt; last week (31st May). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcomed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” them, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; open access advocates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;10 funders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; today there are still only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;two largest producers of research papers in the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/en&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to leave the coalition. RJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How, when and why did RJ leave?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March RJ published &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an open letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Leave or remain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next day (7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March) RJ posted a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;May 28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;) RJ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that it had left the coalition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Confusingly, although the May 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin&quot;&gt;Marika Hedin&lt;/a&gt;. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Evolved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;letter. It is also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;10 Plan S Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More puzzling perhaps, the May 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Head of Open Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; May).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;amp;A. She replied, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank you, but I have no further comments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Openness and transparency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm. And this change appears to date from&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html&quot;&gt; the point at which funders began to take up the cause&lt;/a&gt; and started introducing ever more oppressive OA mandates. Increasingly, decisions are taken behind closed doors and new rules are imposed on unwilling and hapless researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And is there not a hint of hypocrisy here? Principle 5 of Plan S insists that publishers must be transparent about their pricing and processes, including their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/journal-transparency-rules-help-scholars-pick-where-publish&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;editorial policies, their decision-making, their acceptance rates and their review times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Researchers, meanwhile, face ever more bureaucratic scrutiny in order to ensure compliance and are threatened with sanctions if they fail to comply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should we not expect cOAlition S members to live by the same rules of responsibility and transparency that they seek to force on publishers and researchers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it not therefore incumbent on RJ to explain in more detail what it thought it was signing up to, why it signed up if it did not understand the implications of doing so, and why it subsequently chose to leave, despite apparently having had its demands met – that is, both the timetable and the implementation of Plan S were adjusted to become more flexible? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should we not also expect decisions about open access to be decided in a democratic and open manner? How, for instance, did signatory funders make their decisions about joining Plan S and how open to scrutiny is that decision-making process?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1100679321868554240&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;invited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; all members of cOAlition S to send me a link to, or copy of, the minutes of the meetings of the board (or similar) where it was agreed to join the coalition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only three funders responded and not one pointed me to any minutes. Of those who responed, two were private funders – the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation – and one a public funder, Formas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In responding for Wellcome, Kiley &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1100168492848951296&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been taken by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/executive-leadership-team&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Executive Leadership Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This might seem to suggest that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/governance/board-governors&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wellcome Board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which has ultimate responsibility for Wellcome’s activities) had not been consulted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Formas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pressformas/status/1111600447628955648&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;replied&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been made by the Director General, with no mention of the Formas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://formas.se/om-formas/sa-styrs-formas/forskarradet.html#Innehall&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific Council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; having been asked to give approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the minutes of the Board meetings of the Research Council of Norway posted on the Web suggested that the funder did not discuss Plan S until three months after it had signed up. (The minutes of the meeting appear now to have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Saklister_og_referater/1195592857784&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;taken down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from the embarrassment of signing up to an initiative like Plan S only to have the decision later overturned by the Board, this kind of executive power grab is out of tune with the open, transparent and democratic principles that the OA movement was built on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In its letter of March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; RJ makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an important point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: it says that by seeking to force Plan S on researchers without adequate consultation the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt; of Plan S, “has succeeded to turn researchers who have been in favour of Open Science and Robert Merton’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CUDOS principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against these positions. This is an unfortunate development.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That perhaps is the key issue: forcing oppressive OA mandates on researchers may turn out to be counterproductive. Perhaps that is the real reason why RJ left cOAlition S: the failure to get researcher buy-in &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;announcing the initiative. But then why did RJ’s CEO sign up in the first place? Why did RJ not express concern until six months later? And why is it not willing to talk openly and publicly about what happened? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all, if RJ’s concerns about the dangers of seeking to force open access on researchers are valid then the issue is of wider significance than Plan S alone. It is of relevance to the very future of open access and how it is (or is not) achieved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;It’s well-established in psychology that intense emotion and physiological arousal interfere with people’s ability to think straight. Most theories explain this in terms of anxiety consuming mental resources and focusing attention on potential threats. Although it’s tricky to study this topic in the psych lab, a handful of field studies involving parachutists and emergency simulations have largely supported this picture. However, a team at the Autonomous University of Barcelona believe that not enough consideration has so far been given to what they call the “valence” of intense situations – whether or not the person sees the intense experience as positive or negative. To find out whether this makes a difference, Judit Castellà and her colleagues tested dozens of bungee jumpers (most of them first-timers) three times: 30 minutes before a 15M free fall jump; immediately afterwards; and again eight minutes after that.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprising findings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1617675&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1617675&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cognition and Emotion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that when an intensely arousing experience is perceived positively, it may actually enhance cognition rather than be impairing. “Although we expected some degree of moderation, that is, an attenuation of the negative impact of high arousal reported in the literature, we did not predict an actual improvement or a total lack of impairment,” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37281&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the three testing stages conducted on a 30M high bridge in Catalonia, the bungee jumpers rated how positive or negative they were feeling, and the intensity of those feelings. They also completed tests of their working memory (the ability to recall strings of digits); their ability to concentrate and pay attention (using what’s known as the Go/No Go Task); and their decision making (their ability to identify which of four packs of cards was the most financially rewarding over time). Their performance was compared with an age-matched group of control participants who completed all the same tests in a similar environment but who were not performing a jump.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the jumpers reported far more intense emotions than the control group. Importantly, the jumpers rated these feelings as highly positive before and especially after the jump. However the main finding is that working memory actually improved in the jumpers after their jump (but not in the controls), and there was a hint that the jumpers’ decision making might have improved too. Meanwhile, the jumpers’ attention performance was unaffected. In short, bungee jumping, although perceived as an intense emotional experience, was not found to impair cognition, and in fact enhanced aspects of it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castellà and her colleagues interpreted their findings in terms of the “Broaden and Build Theory” – the idea that positive emotions can make cognitive functions more flexible and can counteract the narrowing influence of negative emotions. This is just one small study and, as always, the results need replicating and extending. However, the researchers added that their findings could have practical relevance for the training of emergency responders or any professionals who need to make rapid decisions in intensely arousing situations. “Training these professionals to cope with emergency situations by enhancing and focusing on the positive emotions derived from their actions could improve – or at least not impair – their cognitive performance when facing threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;critique of the neural coding metaphor&lt;/a&gt;, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/&quot;&gt;Mark Bickhard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129&quot;&gt;subjective physics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;neural coding essay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9&quot;&gt;in my response to commentaries&lt;/a&gt; (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/&quot;&gt;problematic aspects&lt;/a&gt; with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Building on campaign promises, President Trump has declared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national emergency&lt;/a&gt; to fund a wall on the US-Mexico border, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-dreamers-daca-immigration-announcement-n798686&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to end the DACA program&lt;/a&gt; that allows undocumented children to remain in the US, and threatened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180927.100295/full/#.W7GHsdt-Gns.twitter&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;change public charge rules&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, President Trump doubled down by announcing an immigration reform proposal that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-05-16/trump-to-announce-new-immigration-plan&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase border security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/donald-trump-jared-kushner-white-house-immigration-plan-principles/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;limit visas given to relatives&lt;/a&gt; of US residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a statement by President Trump on immigration, health clinics were deserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a well-regulated immigration system is certainly important, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hispanics-forgo-health-services-to-avoid-officials-attention-advocates-say/2018/01/21/3555412e-ff1d-11e7-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.60bb356523a4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/legal-immigrants-in-seattle-area-alarmed-over-possible-penalties-for-using-benefits/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration’s efforts could lead to an unintended consequence: reducing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1700829?casa_token=CHdj17HI_iwAAAAA:knd2T9vTo6H9mC1MVtc4B8G8wqkAIkizhkCdNsg2geRHB3FrW0geHyjR3oxRYJDgaCgZGZt7oEheX88&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health access&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1711416?casa_token=5y5swy7vY74AAAAA%3AoBrX72-FdlnA9Cctk9BGudA5BLTKSYVPHrISxJ65mfgciZxgqiCcgbnV-xgiNi1t-dFywFBxQdVLD3Q&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; for immigrants already in the US. Scholarly research into this possibility however, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/15/18094901/trump-immigration-policy-food-stamps-snap&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05495&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the large Hispanic immigrant population here in Texas, our research team decided to explore the relationship ourselves, investigating if and how the Trump administration’s immigration efforts have affected Hispanic immigrant health in newly published research in BMC Health Services Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study this relationship, we conducted focus groups with health advocates and Community Health Workers across the state of Texas. These health workers serve as bridge figures between vulnerable populations like immigrant communities and the health system. In detailed discussions held in major cities (Houston and Dallas), border regions (El Paso and McAllen), and more rural parts of Texas, these experienced health workers provided insight into the barriers faced by documented and undocumented Hispanics across the state. Our research identified several key changes in Hispanic health that the Trump administration’s efforts have brought about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is on the rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across our discussions with these health workers, perhaps the most common theme was that fear is on the rise among Hispanic populations. While fear is ever-present in daily life for undocumented immigrants, our participants noted growing fear in the current political environment. For example, one health worker noted that “when he (President Trump) became president, it was noticeable the fear was rising” and another noted that it is “immobilizing people” and that “fear has become a factor of life.” Interestingly, health workers in Houston noted that this fear was particularly problematic during Hurricane Harvey – as many Hispanics avoided the help they needed because in some cases, Customs and Border Patrol boats were being used for water rescues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies and rhetoric matter for health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear, which health workers attributed to the Trump administration’s policy efforts as well as the President’s rhetoric, is decreasing access to needed health services for Hispanics across Texas. For example, one health worker noted that in the wake of a statement by President Trump on immigration, health clinics were deserted: “It was like a Friday… he [Trump] was threatening to deport people left and right. That next Monday and almost the entire week, our clinics, everybody didn’t even cancel, they didn’t show up. They were terrified.” Our participants have suggested that this trend is pervasive across Texas. As the President and his administration continue to emphasize immigration, people are avoiding engaging in many of the activities typical in daily life, including visits to health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children’s nutrition is at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11045&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11045 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Health-access3-300x200.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fearful parents may withdraw their children from nutritional support programs. © FatCamera / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health workers in Texas, the policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children. Our research suggests that children who are eligible for food assistance through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are not getting the nutritional services they need. Some immigrant parents, fearful of their enrollment information being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are dis-enrolling their families in these programs that provide important nutritional services. As one health worker noted, many clients “say I’m not renewing because if I renew I’m going to get deported. So we lost a lot of people… their kids are the ones that were suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, our research suggests that as the Trump administration continues to pursue a hard line on immigration, Hispanic health access could continue to decline. As fear rises, many are not seeking out the social services that they need, affecting documented and undocumented immigrants in Texas, as well as their children. With additional immigration reforms under consideration, health officials in Texas and beyond need to be aware that vulnerable populations may be facing additional barriers to getting the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Looking Good: Tips for creating your PLOS figures graphics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/cMZuq99n1yk/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/art-color-color-palette-159560-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance your research with tips and tools from the experts on the PLOS Production Team. This post is part of our new Format for Success series where we’ll share advice for generating figures and graphics that make submitting a breeze. Stay tuned for more. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that preparing graphics files can be one of the most challenging parts of submitting your hard work to a publisher, when you would rather be observing in the field, experimenting in the lab, or conversing with the community. Like you, we want your research to shine and be noticed by your peers, adding to the scientific discourse and fostering collaboration in and across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you create the best images possible and ensure a smooth article production experience, we’ve put together our top tips, distilled to a few major areas, for assessing your graphics files during submission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider raster images vs vector images&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;em&gt;Raster images&lt;/em&gt; are made of pixels. A pixel is a single point or the smallest single element in a display device. &lt;em&gt;Vector images&lt;/em&gt; are mathematical calculations from one point to another that form lines and shapes, which adjust to fit a monitor display and zoom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journal article pages use raster graphics for in-article figure display, the lightbox figure viewer, and carousel thumbnails.  Raster graphics are easier to create, store, and transfer across platforms, but limit resolution to 600 dpi. Alternatively, vector graphics are only available in the article PDF accessed online, but will result in a more detailed image at high zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a resolution between 300 and 600 dpi&lt;/strong&gt; – Effective resolutions below 300 dpi (dots/pixels per inch) often result in a blurry, jagged or pixelated image that is not optimal to publish, and resolutions above 600 dpi frequently must be resized or rescaled. We are required by the PLOS publishing platform, and community indexes like PubMed Central, to ensure content adheres to these resolutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine multi-panel images&lt;/strong&gt; – Often, it’s useful to exhibit a Part A, Part B, and Part C, all within one figure image. To create a multi-paneled figure from individual images, we suggest using a presentation program like PowerPoint, Word or GIMP to arrange your panels, create labels, and scale or size your figures. Multi-paneled figures need to fit into a single page or be broken apart into separate figures in order to publish clearly and accurately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatten image layers&lt;/strong&gt; – Unflattened images can incorporate alpha channels, which include a transparent layer potentially containing “junk”, “artifacts”. Sometimes, an unflattened image can also render a figure into a complete black or white rectangle, obscuring all your content. We recommend that you flatten your graphics to combine all the layers into a single background layer, so we can ensure the quality of the output equals your intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compress file size with LZW compression&lt;/strong&gt; – Data compression helps to reduce file size and also decreases time required to download and upload content. With compressed files, we can help you reduce the size of your article PDF, improving a researcher’s ability to access your work and send it to colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using PACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you assess your figure images, PLOS also offers authors a free, web-based imaging review tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&quot;&gt;PACE&lt;/a&gt;, that evaluates figures against our platform requirements and fixes the most-common image issues, detailing any changes made, or informs the user what outstanding issues may exist.  PACE compiles two, online review options in the form of typeset page mockups to give users an idea of how the uploaded image would appear in the final article. To use PACE, simply register with your email address: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&quot;&gt;https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to undertaking a scientific protocol, PLOS’s production team follows specific rules to ensure that the accepted content is correctly transformed to XML and PDF in order to publish accurately in our journal sites and syndication targets. In short, graphic images must generally conform to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;File format&lt;/em&gt; – TIFF or EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dimensions&lt;/em&gt; – Width: 789 – 2250 pixels (at 300 dpi). Height maximum: 2625 pixels (at 300 dpi).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resolution&lt;/em&gt; – 300 – 600 dpi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;File size&lt;/em&gt; – 10MB or under&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure files naming&lt;/em&gt; – Fig1.tif, Fig2.eps, and so on. Match file name to caption label and citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caption&lt;/em&gt; – Place within the manuscript as simple text, not within the figure file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve posted additional graphics recommendations, as well as instructions for exporting graphics from specialized software, here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures&quot;&gt;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope these suggestions make figure preparation even easier so you can spend more time advancing your field and we can publish your work faster than ever.  We encourage you to email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:figures@plos.org&quot;&gt;figures@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; with further questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that more talkative parents have children with superior language or cognitive skills has a long – and sometimes controversial – history. An influential study from the early 1990s claimed that American children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have poorer language development because they hear fewer words from their parents. But scientists have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/01/615188051/lets-stop-talking-about-the-30-million-word-gap&quot;&gt;pointed out several issues with this early research&lt;/a&gt; – including that it involved researchers going into people’s homes to record them, potentially affecting the language they used.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, other researchers in the United States have researched families’ use of language in a less intrusive way – and found that any effects may be more subtle than originally claimed. Now, in what they say is the “largest naturalistic observation study of early life home environments to date”, scientists have brought these methods across the pond. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23388-001&quot;&gt;study of more than 100 London families&lt;/a&gt;, published recently in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, has found that the quantity of language used by parents &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; related to children’s cognitive skills – but exactly why remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37273&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katrina d’Apice from the University of York and her colleagues equipped 107 children aged between two and four with wearable devices that recorded all language spoken by them or their family for three days. Software then automatically processed the recordings, which averaged 15 hours per day, to calculate how many words were spoken by the adults in the family. The children also completed a series of cognitive tests, which involved tasks like copying and drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that adults spoke an average of 17,800 words per day – but this varied considerably. Even within families, the number of words spoken by adults across different days was only moderately correlated. “Our findings emphasize that early life experiences, especially with regard to language, are dynamic processes that change and evolve over time, rather than static environmental determinants,” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team found that, overall, adult word counts were related to children’s cognitive skills: children whose parents used more words tended to do better in the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at the richness of parents’ and children’s vocabulary, finding that children had a greater lexical diversity when adults’ vocabulary was also more diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlational design of the study means it’s impossible to tease apart cause and effect, so there are a number of possible explanations for the findings. It could be that more exposure to language fosters children’s intelligence, for example. Or parents could simply be stimulated to talk more when their children are smarter. There could also be shared genetic effects influencing both the parents’ language and children’s cognitive abilities.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether these results generalise to other groups remains to be seen – more than 80 per cent of parents in this study held a university degree; almost all of them were married; and they were mostly high socio-economic status. Nevertheless, the use of discreet recording devices and automatic language processing software would seem to open up the field to many more naturalistic studies like this in the future.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23388-001&quot;&gt;A naturalistic home observational approach to children’s language, cognition, and behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We move house, change jobs, begin new relationships, yet most of the time, most of us still experience a thread of inner continuity – a constant feeling of me-ness that transcends the various chapters of our lives. Indeed, there’s evidence that having a stable, constant sense of self and identity is important for psychological wellbeing. However, this thread can rupture, leading to an uncomfortable disconnect between who we feel we are today, and the person that we believe we used to be – a state that psychologists recently labelled “derailment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702619829748&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; a group led by Kaylin Ratner at Cornell University has explored the possibility that derailment both precipitates, and is a consequence of, depression. After all, people with depression often struggle with motivation, losing the will to pursue goals they previously held dear. They also frequently withdraw from their relationships and social roles. All of these changes could trigger sensations of derailment. Or perhaps derailment comes first, with the inner disorientation leaving one vulnerable to depression. Surprisingly these questions have been little studied before now. “We nominate derailment as a new feature of the depressive landscape and underscore the need for greater empirical and practical attention at the crossroads of mental health and human development,” Ratner and her team write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37243&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited nearly a thousand undergraduate students and asked them to complete measures of depression and derailment four times over the course of an academic year. The recently developed 10-item derailment measure was based on the students’ agreement or not with statements like “My life has been headed in the same direction for a long time,” and “I did not anticipate becoming the person that I currently am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the students’ scores on depression and derailment were relatively stable across the course of the year. Also, students’ derailment and depression symptoms tended to correlate at each of the measurement time points – implying there may well be an association between the two. In terms of cause and effect, and as the researchers predicted in advance, higher depression scores at an earlier time point tended to presage increases in derailment scores later on. However, in what they described as a “curious finding”, higher derailment scores earlier in the year actually tended to herald a &lt;em&gt;decline&lt;/em&gt; in depression symptoms later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratner and her team propose a number of explanations for this last finding – including that while derailment may be uncomfortable at first, it may catalyze people to withdraw from relationships and/or goals that are unfulfilling, thus leading to wellbeing gains in the longer term. The researchers also pondered whether there might be moderating factors that alter whether derailment leads to increases or reductions in depression – such as whether people find meaning in their feelings of derailment, and/or how much they end up ruminating over the feelings. Such questions remain for future research, as do many other outstanding issues, such as how derailment and depression might be related in other non-student groups and over longer time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although derailment is a novel construct and one that is still in the process of being mapped, researchers and practitioners would be keen to take note of derailment being a feature of depression’s landscape and continue to observe how such perceived changes in identity and self-direction could take shape and act within clinical presentations,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/breastfeeding-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe is working towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. All pregnant and breastfeeding women who are HIV-infected are initiated on Option B+ treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women on this regimen are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for six months along with starting or continuing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Exclusive breastfeeding is not an easy feat, particularly for HIV-infected mothers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2336-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; explored the challenges faced by these women on the PMTCT program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges in implementing and studying PMTCT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study is premised on the assumption that the biomedical framework of ART initiation has informed most of the studies on PMTCT at the expense of the social model of health.  The complex interactions of the biological, psychological and social processes that shape behavior have not been seriously considered.  Mothers on PMTCT are not considered within the context of the broader environmental factors that influence their behavior. Policymakers often do not account for cultural factors when introducing interventions to address societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are multiple advantages from the ‘test, treat, and breastfeed all infants’ strategy of PMTCT, a plethora of challenges can compromise and prevent the achievement of the desired health benefits for both the mother and her infant. These include HIV-related stigma, fear of transmitting HIV to the baby, and  ART side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women’s struggles, in their own words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in our study struggled with exclusive breastfeeding, which was promoted by the health professionals and policy makers. There was consensus among the women regarding their fear of infecting their infants through the breast milk. One woman felt that the nurses were cruel by insisting that they breast feed: &lt;em&gt;“If these nurses were HIV positive would they breastfeed”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our qualitative study revealed that stigma, both enacted and felt, was a reality. One woman felt that people gossiped about her HIV status: &lt;em&gt;“ Whenever I approach people they change the subject and you can tell they were talking about you,”&lt;/em&gt; while another felt that people did not want to be near her: &lt;em&gt;“It is as if I have a stench.” &lt;/em&gt;Health providers, perhaps unintentionally, enhanced the stigma by attending to HIV-infected patients at specific times and labeling them as &lt;em&gt;“those for tablets&lt;/em&gt;” (a local term used for people on ART).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concern about stigma further challenged the women’s adherence to exclusive breastfeeding, fearing that it would be tantamount to giving away one’s HIV status, as it is against the community norms of infant feeding which involves giving water, traditional medicines and foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure of HIV status to family was also a major challenge which negatively impacted on the women’s ability to follow through with exclusive breastfeeding. The women, despite the knowledge received from the health workers, ended up mixed feeding their babies and not adhering to their ART medication due to fear that their families would find out their status. One of the women said, &lt;em&gt;“When I was diagnosed HIV positive during antenatal care, I (hypothetically) asked my husband for his reaction … he became so livid … I hide my medication in the garden ….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study clearly shows that the success of the PMTCT program cannot be merely measured by uptake of Option B+, which rose from 65% to 99% in 2018. Taking cognizance of the contextual factors where interventions are being introduced is key. Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems. There is a need to address cultural practices which could lead to HIV infection in babies during the postnatal period, such as giving babies traditional medicines and other foods. Programs should be aware that a ‘one size fits all’ approach does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS welcomes the revised Plan S guidelines</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/i908V6XekWQ/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a fully Open Access publisher entirely ready to support cOAlition S-funded authors, we have always been in a position to give our support to this bold initiative, and entirely agree that the driving principles and overall objective of Plan S have not been lessened or changed. cOAlition S has clearly listened to constructive suggestions from the community, and there is now enhanced scope for continued community dialogue, alongside the forward momentum. There are a number of revisions which we recognize will make the transition easier for the community, and which clarify or acknowledge other important factors, such as:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversity of models underpinning OA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – The clarification that neither Plan S nor OA insists on the APC/publication fee model is a key refinement. While this has been a dominant model of OA publishing (including ours) in the Global North, it is absolutely necessary for any OA policies, plans, or mandates to be clear that OA is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for research, not a single or specific &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;business model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commitment to research assessment based on intrinsic merit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;– PLOS is an active member of DORA and appreciates the emphasis on changing the reward and incentive system of research. The OA movement has always operated closely with movements to improve the culture of research, and so we welcome this acknowledgement;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preprints and peer review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – PLOS advocates the posting of preprints to accelerate sharing of knowledge and welcomes cOalition S’s  “strong encouragement” for the early sharing of research through preprints while acknowledging that preprint posting alone is not a route to Plan S compliance. The value of high quality peer review as a “significant addition of value to scholarly communication” as emphasized in the Plan S Rationale is recognized at PLOS and was a driver in our move to offer published peer review, giving authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The timeline shift for Plan S implementation to 2021 will be helpful to gain even more community support for the initiative. But we (along with many other publishers) remind the community that PLOS is already 100% Plan S compliant, and our suite of seven journals is available immediately for your cOAlition S-funded work  in most scholarly disciplines relevant to Plan S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS was founded on the principle that scholarly knowledge is a public good. We welcome the bold move of funders aligned behind the fundamental principle that no scholarly publication should be locked behind a paywall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and I would often be so hooked on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis&quot;&gt;Sega Mega Drive&lt;/a&gt; video game that we’d play all day long, breaking only for munchies or when nature called. Our parents would urge (plead with) us to get outside, especially when it was sunny. “The fresh air and exercise will do you good”, they would say, or similar. Fast forward to now, and the anxiety over all the time that children and young people spend in front of screens, be it playing video games, watching TV or using social media, has of course only intensified. Surely it can’t be mentally or physically healthy, can it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look to psychologists to provide an answer, we find a field divided. At one extreme, some experts point to survey data throwing up apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/&quot;&gt;worrying correlations between increased screen time and increased mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;. Yet other experts are sceptical, in part because of what they see as the poor quality of much of the correlational evidence for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this latter camp are Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski at the University of Oxford, the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, which aims to set new standards for research in this area – including by using time-use diary-based reports of screen time (rather than relying on notoriously unreliable retrospective reports), and by pre-registering their methods and hypotheses, thus guarding against the kind of post-hoc data-mining that they say has plagued the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37215&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair began with an exploratory analysis of two large surveys of thousands of teenagers, one based in Ireland, the other in the USA. These included data on teens’ mental health and wellbeing (including mood, depression and self-esteem) and their screen time (including time on TV, computer, and video-games and smartphones). The screen time measures included commonly used retrospective reports, such as “how much time do you typically spend during a weekday watching TV, playing video games etc?”, but crucially also detailed diary-based measures, in which each participant broke down their precise activities during every 15-minute period of a given day (either completed through that day, in the evening or the next day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orben and Przybylski found a handful of statistically significant correlations between screen time and wellbeing, and then they used these to make some specific evidence-based, pre-registered (written down publicly in advance) predictions about the kind of screen time–wellbeing associations they were looking for in a second, “confirmatory study”. This is a robust methodological approach that avoids the pitfalls of scouring a large data set hunting for all and any significant correlations (such post-hoc result hunting carries the risk that any associations that do turn up are flukes rather than meaningful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey data Orben and Przybylski used in their confirmatory study involved over 10,000 British teenagers (aged 14 to 15) and their caregivers, who once again provided retrospective and diary-based information on their screen time and completed wellbeing measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a few statistically significant correlations, including: between greater self-reported screen time and lower wellbeing; and greater diary-recorded screen time and lower wellbeing. Based on some mixed results from the exploratory work, the pair also looked specifically at screen time prior to bed, but this was not found to be associated with wellbeing. Critically, the significant associations that Orben and Przybylski did find were very weak – in fact, of a magnitude “too small to merit substantial scientific discussion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair provide a graphic illustration of the average size of the associations between screen time and wellbeing that they found. Assuming that causality flows in the direction of greater screen time to poorer wellbeing (the research is cross-sectional so we don’t know if this is the case), then given the size of the association, teenagers would have to increase their screen time use by over 63 hours per day for it to have an effect on their wellbeing that they would actually notice (this is based on what is known from past research about the kind of wellbeing changes that are subjectively noticeable). Of course such an increase is a practical impossibility, thus showing the practical insignificance of the documented correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While aiming to set new standards for research in this area, the researchers admit their study has its own limitations – among them that the data on screen time and wellbeing were not collected at the same time, potentially reducing the chance to identify meaningful relations between the two. Also, some may wonder whether total screen time (however carefully it is measured) is the right metric – perhaps it is too crude and it is the nature of one’s relationship with digital devices that is more relevant to wellbeing, such as why they are used, whether the screen time displaces other meaningful activities, and if there is a compulsive quality to the usage or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329&quot;&gt;Screens, Teens, and Psychological Well-Being: Evidence From Three Time-Use-Diary Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How does family history affect the risk of preterm birth?</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/05/31/how-does-family-history-affect-the-risk-of-preterm-birth/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-4-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you look at a sibling design to study associations between maternal and offspring preterm birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to term infants, preterm infants, especially those born earliest, are more likely to experience a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608601361?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;myriad of health-related problems&lt;/a&gt;, from neurodevelopmental problems in childhood to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders later in life. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608600744?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;etiology of preterm birth&lt;/a&gt; is multifactorial, complex and not well understood. One poorly understood factor is the intergenerational recurrence of preterm birth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3109/00016340903358820&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; have consistently shown that women born preterm are more likely to have preterm babies. Based on this evidence, it has been recommended to include maternal birth status in risk assessment when planning pregnancy care for individual women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with most previous studies is that they were not designed to account for familial confounding. Comparing preterm delivery rates of women born preterm versus women born at term, regardless of family characteristics, does not answer the question of whether being born preterm is itself a risk factor for preterm delivery. Women born preterm may have different family characteristics than those born at term and those characteristics may account for the higher risk of preterm delivery. To answer that question appropriately and rule out familial confounding, we need to compare sisters of discordant preterm birth status using sibling designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibling designs are particularly suited to study the effect of a factor that differs between siblings; in this case, whether a woman who was born preterm is more likely to deliver preterm than her sister(s) not born preterm. If being born preterm is itself a risk factor, then preterm sisters would be more likely to deliver preterm babies than their sisters not born preterm. Conversely, if discordant siblings have a similar risk of delivering preterm, this means that being born preterm is not the cause, but something else that is shared by the sisters and puts both sister at higher risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2304-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;That is precisely what we found&lt;/a&gt;. Women born at term with a sister born preterm had a similarly elevated risk of delivering a preterm infant (10%) as their preterm sisters, in contrast with women born at term with sisters born at term (6.1%) or without sisters (6.0%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the potential implications of your research in identifying women at higher risks of preterm delivery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main implication is that the focus of the risk assessment may be better shifted from the individual to the family. Our results suggest that it is not the fact of having been born preterm that puts women at higher risk of delivering preterm, but the fact of having been born to a mother who ever delivered preterm. Our findings do not support the notion of seeing maternal preterm birth status itself as an individual risk factor for preterm delivery. Rather, consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery and perhaps other pregnancy complications characterized by intergenerational transmission patterns, such as hypertensive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/20/three-week-diary-study-sex-today-increases-sense-of-meaning-in-life-tomorrow/&quot;&gt;important part&lt;/a&gt; of most &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/14/try-something-new-together-research-shows-engaging-in-self-expanding-activities-rekindles-the-sexual-desire-of-long-term-couples/&quot;&gt;romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; – and when couples are not on the same page about their sex life, it can become a source of frustration. Research has found that couples have sex about 1 or 2 times a week, but about half of sexual advances between partners go unfulfilled.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/p9nc8/&quot;&gt;uploaded recently to PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; sheds some light on how responses to sexual advances influence individuals’ feelings of sexual and relationship satisfaction. The study suggests that while having an advance accepted leaves partners feeling more content, this effect may be short-lived compared to the dissatisfaction of being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37241&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a peek into the bedrooms of 115 heterosexual couples (participants were aged between 19 and 64), Kiersten Dobson from the University of Western Ontario and colleagues asked them all to keep sex diaries. Every day for 3 weeks, both partners independently logged whether they or their partner had made a sexual advance, and if so, whether that led to sexual activity. They also recorded their daily levels of satisfaction with their sexual relationship, as well as their relationship generally, answering questions such as “How good is your relationship compared to most?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found that accepting a sexual advance, or having an advance accepted by the partner, resulted in an increase in both sexual and relationship satisfaction that day compared to other days.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, being rejected decreased sexual satisfaction. But intriguingly, if the participant themselves was the rejecter – that is, if they shunned an advance from their partner – their sexual satisfaction still increased. (Neither being rejected nor being the rejecter had any effect on general relationship satisfaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in sexual satisfaction could still be detected days after advances were made. The team found that the boost in satisfaction from having an advance accepted persisted for 24 hours, with the slump of being rejected lasting twice as long. And the gratification that came from being either an acceptor or a rejecter lasted a remarkable 72 hours.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem especially surprising that rejecting a partner’s advances gives a boost in sexual satisfaction, particularly one that appears to last for three days. But rather than reflecting some pleasure derived from rejecting someone, the researchers suggest that being approached for sex leaves a person feeling desired, so enhances sexual satisfaction even when no actual sex ends up happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the negative effects of being sexually rejected by a partner last longer than the positive effects of being accepted mean that making an advance can be a risky move, the authors say.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“The act of making a sexual advance may be a high-risk situation for romantic partners, which may in turn lead those who feel less sure of their partner’s response to an advance to take the risk of making an advance less often,” they write. This could ultimately lead to fewer opportunities to bolster intimacy through sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t reveal anything about whether there is a way to buffer against the negative effects of rejection, though, or how different individuals respond. For example, the same team previously found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/25/study-of-long-term-heterosexual-couples-finds-women-over-estimate-and-men-underestimate-their-partners-sexual-advances/&quot;&gt;men underestimate, and women overestimate, how often their partners make sexual advances&lt;/a&gt; – though gender didn’t seem to play a role in the new study. However, it would be interesting to know whether other individual differences might alter people’s responses to acceptance or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/p9nc8/&quot;&gt;Responses to sexual advances and satisfaction in romantic relationships: Is yes good and no bad?&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version on which this report was based]&lt;/p&gt;

PLOS is excited to support reagent repositories such as Addgene as yet another step to improve scientific reproducibility. Open access to research findings and the underlying methods, materials and data, and issues surrounding reproducibility, replication, and research waste will be discussed this June 2-5 at the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcri2019.org/index/programme/conference-theme&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; World Conference on Research Integrity in Hong Kong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, where PLOS ONE’s Senior Editor, Renee Hoch, will present a talk on data availability and image integrity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Without materials and data, there is no research. Barriers to scientific progress can result from something as basic as not having access to reliable, validated information for research materials. That barrier is raised further when scientists cannot obtain samples or data in a timely fashion. Data and material repositories are breaking down these barriers. As a publisher, PLOS is supporting better, more open science by recommending repositories and encouraging use of standardized, unique identifiers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;for materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Centralized depositing of materials advances science in so many ways. It saves authors the time and burden of shipping requested materials. Researchers who request from repositories save time by not having to recreate reagents or wait months or years to receive samples. Many scientists have been on the receiving end of a request that was filled by an incorrect or degraded sample, which further delays research. Repositories like the ones recommended by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; handle the logistics of material requests, letting the scientists focus on what’s important: doing research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For example, repositories make it possible for researchers to get access to different cell lines (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atcc.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;American Type Culture Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coriell.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Coriell Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), plant materials (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://abrc.osu.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), organisms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsc.indiana.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/home&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Caenorhabditis Genetics Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xenopusresource.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;European Xenopus Resource Centre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jax.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), plasmids (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addgene.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;DNASU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/Home.xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PlasmID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) and many other biological materials. Moreover, many of these repositories provide web-based databases that are easy to search and provide openly available information about each material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For reagent reporting, many repositories also support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/unique-and-persistent-plasmid-ids-available-addgene-plasmid-ids-rrids&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; unique and persistent identification of reagents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Identifiers like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; make it easy for authors to cite materials and improves reporting through standardized identification and a permanent link to information about each reagent. For example, each &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Drosophila&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; strain at the Bloomington Fly stock Center is assigned a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=BDSC_722&amp;amp;l=BDSC_722&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;fly stock RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. For mice, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) provides a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=MMRRC_026409-UCD&amp;amp;l=MMRRC_026409-UCD&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mouse RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for mutant mouse strains. For plasmids, Addgene will automatically register a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;amp;l=Addgene_44362&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;plasmid RRID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; upon deposit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depositing increases materials transparency and reproducibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene currently contains over 70,000 unique plasmids and has distributed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/celebrating-one-million-plasmids-shared&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;over 1,000,000 plasmids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; worldwide since 2004. At Addgene, depositing plasmids is free and straightforward, with the added bonus that it provides quality control measures that contribute to improved reproducibility. Addgene performs full plasmid sequencing and each plasmid is assigned a unique &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;amp;l=Addgene_44362&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;RRID identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, along with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addgene.org/44362/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;a plasmid webpage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that provides sequence data, cloning information, and associated protocols. This ensures researchers have detailed information about each plasmid reagent. Moreover, each Addgene plasmid page provides an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/more-data-for-you-find-articles-citing-addgene-plasmids&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Articles Citing this Plasmid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; section which allows researchers to learn how the plasmid was used and validated by different labs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognition and credit for depositing authors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Depositing materials at the time of publication also provides benefits to both authors and publishers. Depositing authors gain recognition and are cited whenever requestors use the published materials in their own research articles. In fact, data from Addgene supports that depositing published plasmids in Addgene’s repository increases their use and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.addgene.org/addgene-depositors-get-more-citations&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;results in increased article citations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Deposition at the point of publication also ensures timely distribution of materials. Finally, the information linked to each deposited reagent serves as reliable open data for the materials reported in the publication, simplifying the manuscript-writing process. Overall, PLOS’s support of reagent repositories, follows the publisher’s steps in improving &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocol sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and is a welcome addition for improving materials access and scientific reproducibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New sharing practices will change science for the better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By encouraging authors to deposit materials at the time of publication, journals will help accelerate research through timely distribution and accurate identification of reagents. Biological repositories exist to serve the scientific community. Take &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/crispr.2018.0022&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addgene’s involvement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in the explosive advancement of CRISPR research. Since 2012, over 8,400 CRISPR plasmids have been deposited and Addgene has distributed over 144,000 CRISPR plasmids worldwide, enabling researchers to share, modify, and improve this game-changing molecular tool. It is a prime example of the positive impact that biological repositories are making on research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thanks to PLOS’s updated recommendations, the importance of depositing and sharing reagents is finally getting some much-needed recognition. If the positive outcomes of PLOS’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;protocol sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; policies is any indication of what’s in store for open material sharing, the future of science looks bright: speedier, more transparent, and more reproducible research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hurt myself today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To see if I still feel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Hurt &lt;/i&gt;by Nine Inch Nails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate self-injury (without the intent to commit suicide) is widely thought to be a way that some people, especially teenagers and young adults, cope with or express feelings that they find overwhelming. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/2azer/&quot;&gt;a set of three studies&lt;/a&gt; published as a preprint at &lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt; by psychologists at Swansea University, reveals that difficulties with perceiving and interpreting the bodily signals of emotion may also play a role – a finding that could help inspire new treatment approaches.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37238&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, interviews with people who have self-harmed have included reports that they feel both “overwhelmed” by emotions they can’t identify, but also emotionally detached or “numb”. Hayley Young and her colleagues reasoned that if an individual is struggling to read their bodily signals of emotion properly (and “interoceptive ability” – the ability to sense physiological signals – is known to dip in adolescence), then self-injury may work to generate a stronger bodily input into their emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three related studies using more than 300 young adult participants, mostly women. In the first few studies, the researchers looked for links between self-harm and self-reported factors, such as perceived difficulties in identifying and describing emotions. In the final study, interoceptive ability was measured using a standard method in which a person has to count their heartbeats over a period of time (without actually feeling for a pulse or using any other aid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results revealed that participants with a history of self-harm were characterised by “a difficulty in distinguishing and interpreting interoceptive signals”. Participants who had self-harmed reported being &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; aware than others of general bodily sensations, but they tended to score worse on the interoceptive accuracy test.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an important finding as low interoceptive awareness may be the biological basis for reports of ‘absent affect’ and ‘detachment’ and ‘disembodiement’” in those who self-harm, the researchers write. Low interoceptive accuracy may also contribute to self-harm, they suggest, in driving the individual to manipulate the way the body contributes to the experience of emotion.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function of self-harm “may be to resolve a state of interoceptive and emotional uncertainty —&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;[it] may serve to disambiguate the body’s role in emotional experience and provide clarity about what is being felt,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research that’s linked superior interoception to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68667/&quot;&gt;better emotional functioning&lt;/a&gt;, including experiencing more nuanced emotions. Conversely, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/74442/&quot;&gt;poor interoception has been associated with a wide range of mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including depression and schizophrenia.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young and her team added that their research suggests a pathway to new interventions: “a focus on improving compassionate self-focus may be beneficial.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, other groups are actively working on ways to improve people’s interoceptive accuracy. Sarah Garfinkel at the University of Sussex and her team are trialling just such a treatment for people with autism (poor interoception is relatively common in people with autism spectrum disorder). A pilot study on healthy people, which involved asking participants to count their heartbeats, and giving them feedback on how well they were doing, led to improvements in interoceptive accuracy and reductions in anxiety. This treatment research is ongoing. In theory, it might help with other conditions, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/2azer/&quot;&gt;Non-Suicidal Self-injury is associated with Multidimensional Deficits in Interoception: Evidence from Three Studies&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subject to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version upon which our report was based]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://flocktofedora.org/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt; will be held in Budapest from August 8--11.
As part of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, we've already proposed a talk to discuss how Free/Open
source software links very very well with Free/Open science. Please see the
proposal here, and give feedback: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112&quot;&gt;https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, given that a large number of community members congregate at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://flocktofedora.org/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;, it may be a good chance to get together those of us that work in
science/research and related areas. So, if you are planning to attend &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://flocktofedora.org/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;
and work in, or are interested in science/research, please drop a note at this
tracker ticket: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242&quot;&gt;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have enough of us, we can look at proposing a hackathon also. The first
round of CFPs for flock starts on June 1. So we won't make it for that. We
should be able to make it for the second round on June 15, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

They are canids – dog-like carnivores – with one of, if not the widest distributions of terrestrial mammals in the world. Due to their extreme adaptability, they have successfully colonized almost all terrestrial environments on the planet, from the icy tundra of the North to the scorching hot Australian Outback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11067&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11067&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/9550_07150799-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red foxes don’t need much of an introduction&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also cope well with landscape types that are heavily modified by humans, such as for example agricultural landscapes and even cities. Here, they find all the required resources in abundance and, as a result, can become very abundant themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem in itself, but it can become one for the species that foxes prey upon. Species that are very specialized in their habitat requirements often struggle to survive in heavily fragmented landscapes due to the loss of habitat, but also because of the lower suitability of the remaining habitat fragments. Picture a small forest surrounded by crop fields. Although it is normal for foxes to prey on these species, in such a situation, high predatory losses may become the nail in the coffin for some of those species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, it is often impossible to reverse changes to the landscape and its habitats. Instead, wildlife managers and conservation practitioners often attempt to control populations of abundant predators (including foxes) to benefit prey, usually by means of culling. However, owing to a variety of reasons (e.g. the legal framework, property rights, limited resources), control attempts often take place in comparatively small areas bordering on non-hunted sites that act as a source of foxes to compensate the cull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their widespread occurrence, the effectiveness of such control attempts in terms of their conservation returns is rarely evaluated and therefore not well understood. This may imply that their application is legitimized by conservation targets that are, in fact, often not being achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about effectiveness, we mean two things: first off, control attempts need to cause a reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11066&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11066&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/7765_08010371-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fox taking artificial eggs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in fox abundance of relevant magnitude at the target site. More importantly though, reduced abundance needs to be reflected by reduced predation risk for the prey species over a period of time that is considered particularly relevant, such as its reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, when we decide in favor of killing wild animal populations, we need to make sure that this will actually result in a better chance for the threatened prey to survive. Otherwise, both ethical and economic issues make the matter too contentious to qualify as a management tool in conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the issue we tackled in a recent research project using fox culls in fragmented montane forests as a study system. Using camera-supervised ‘artificial nests’ consisting of brown chicken eggs placed in the forest to serve as a standardized index of predation risk, we evaluated whether incentivized, but spatially heterogeneous fox culls led to a reduction in predation risk and the probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the early summer months of 2017 and 2018 for our experiments to coincide with the reproductive period of a locally threatened prey species: the capercaillie, a fairly specialist bird that nests on the ground in mature and well-structured forest stands. The majority of culling had taken place during the winters preceding the study periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11063&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11063&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Capercailliefemale-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A female capercaillie close to an artificial nest&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using statistical models, we did not find an effect of restricted-area fox culls on predation risk, nor a lower probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites. We know from other research (including our own) that culls of this magnitude can reduce local fox abundance, but effects appear to be compensated by fox populations too rapidly for conservation benefits to manifest. This was the case despite cull intensity likely exceeding red fox density in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly (and in contrast to previous work), there was no relationship between the degree of landscape fragmentation &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; and our index of predation risk, as soon as we had accounted for differences in predator abundance. Instead, predation risk appeared to be driven directly by the abundance of foxes in the landscape around a plot. This suggests that the increased abundance of generalist mesopredators in diverse, fragmented landscape types may be a key factor for elevated predation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implementation of our work is that predator control attempts will – to be effective as a conservation tool – need to be spatially and temporally coordinated to match the biology of both the predator and the target prey species. Whether this can be feasible, depends strongly on regional and local ecosystem contexts and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Otherwise, there is currently little evidence to support uncoordinated culls as a conservation measure.&lt;/p&gt;
