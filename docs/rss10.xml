&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bradley Busch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure does interesting things to an athlete. For some, it leads to an increase in tension, nerves and anxiety. Others are able to channel this increased pressure into running faster, jumping higher and throwing further. What strategies do these “big game players” use to raise their game under heightened pressure – known as a “clutch performance”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Sports Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, researchers from Australia and England recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2016.1265661?journalCode=rjsp20&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the results of their interviews with sixteen athletes from around the world just a few days after they had delivered an excellent sporting performance in a competition when under pressure. The findings represent a step forward in our understanding of expert and skilled performances, showing how clutch performance is similar to, but distinct from, the related concept of “flow”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26063&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Swann at the University of Wollongong, Australia, and his colleagues interviewed 16 athletes (5 women and 11 men, with an average age of 27) who came from a range of team and individual sports that included a Rugby World Cup Winner from New Zealand, a professional tennis player competing at Wimbledon, and an Olympic badminton player. The researchers asked the athletes to describe their recent outstanding performance in as much detail as possible, including what they were thinking and feeling at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the interviews revealed that there were twelve characteristics that underpinned a clutch performance. Six were similar to the state of flow, which is when performance feels effortless and skill set perfectly matches performance demands. These flow-like characteristics included: being fully absorbed in the task to the point that they were unaware of the crowd; high levels of confidence; a sense of control over their performance and the situation; enhanced motivation to succeed; enjoying it just enough (but not too much); and being fully alert. Some of the athletes even reported that time felt like it slowed down, and having a hazy memory of the event. These findings suggest that flow and clutch performances do overlap and are not completely distinct from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, six characteristics of the clutch state were distinct from flow. Whereas flow describes a gradual build-up of confidence and a feeling of effortlessness, other dimensions of clutch performances included: deliberate focus on the task at hand; having intense effort over a period of time (often characterised by not holding anything back); heightened self-awareness of what they were thinking and feeling at the time; high arousal levels; automaticity of skills; and the absence of negative thoughts about perceived consequences if they failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, expert performance has been viewed as largely automatic and dependent on an athlete not overthinking. The new results suggest that although this may be one avenue to heightened performance, it is not the only one. The interviewed athletes recalled raising their game through high levels of self-monitoring and making a conscious effort to raise performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the strategies underpinning clutch performance, such as deliberate focus, high arousal levels, and confidence, are malleable; that is to say that they can be taught, learnt and developed. Knowledge of these findings could be very useful for athletes, coaches and practitioners working with them. Central to this will be exploring when is the best time for athletes to relax and “let it happen”, and, conversely, when to consciously try harder “to make it happen”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study relied on athletes self-reporting their thoughts, feelings and strategies employed under pressure during a competition several days after the event. Although steps were taken within this study to improve accuracy, such as follow-up interviews, there are still obvious limitations with this approach including self-reporting biases and the limitations of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people need to perform under pressure at some stage in their life, be it in public speaking, academic exams, or working closely to a deadline. How much can these new findings be applied to these settings? The researchers urge a bit of caution, as this is still somewhat unknown. They stress that for now it is “important to avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach to expert performance. There may be some underlying principles that can be transferred, but knowing which ones will probably rely on knowledge of both the task at hand and the person who has to execute the skill. The mysteries of performance excellence under pressure in non-sporting domain promises to be an exciting area for psychologists to continue to research over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Statisticians are mounting a challenge to a much-publicized study suggesting that human lifespan has a limit of approximately 115 years — 125, tops. Published last October in Nature, the study from scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York was the eleventh most talked-about piece of research in 2016, according to Altmetric.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Best and Worst in Health and Healthcare – May 2017</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/06/28/best-and-worst-in-health-and-healthcare-may-2017/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;In May, next generation therapies took the spotlight: brain-computer interfaces, brain training, tDCS, DNA vaccines, probiotics… Yet, they weren’t all successful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Here’s the best and worst news of May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The best&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brain–computer interface therapy for post-stroke motor rehabilitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Functional recovery from motor disabilities can be a major challenge following stroke. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/05/26/STROKEAHA.116.016304&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; tested a new therapy for motor-related disabilities affecting the arm in hemiparetic stroke survivors. It consisted of an exoskeleton driven by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/24/brain-machine-interfaces-new-technology-in-the-making/&quot;&gt;brain–computer interface&lt;/a&gt; (BCI) that used neural activity from the unaffected brain hemisphere to control the movement of the affected hand. By using BCI control to associate imagined hand movements with the opening and closing of the affected hand, participants would train the uninjured parts of their brain to take over movements that were previously controlled by the injured areas of the brain. This BCI-based therapy was shown to be effective in improving motor performance. Another important aspect of this study was the fact that this method was designed and configured for home-based neurorehabilitation. Its efficacy therefore showed that BCI-driven neurorehabilitation can be effectively delivered in the home environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A probiotic for IBS-associated depression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 11% of the world’s population and is commonly accompanied by psychiatric symptoms, namely depression and anxiety. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/18/the-brain-gut-axis-part-1-a-paradigm-shift-in-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly acknowledged as a key player in IBS and, via the gut-brain axis, as a likely contributor to the development of the associated psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(17)35557-9/abstract&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; aimed at evaluating the effects of a probiotic bacteria on anxiety and depression in patients with IBS. The probiotic &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; NCC3001 (BL) was administered to 44 adults with IBS and anxiety and/or depression for 6 weeks. It was shown that patients who received the probiotic were more likely to have a reduction in depression scores (but not anxiety) and increased quality of life than patients in the placebo group. BL had no effect on IBS, indicating that the reduction in depression scores was not merely a consequence of a reduction in IBS symptoms. Through fMRI analysis, these effects were shown to be linked to changes in brain activation patterns reflecting an effect of the probiotic on the limbic system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brain training for chronic TBI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Brain training has shown beneficial effects in acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) therapy, but studies on its effects in chronic TBI are still lacking. Therefore, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434192/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; aimed at determining how the injured brain responds to cognitive training months-to-years after injury. Subjects with chronic TBI received &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/01/25/boost-confidence-with-brain-training/&quot;&gt;cognitive training&lt;/a&gt; for 8 weeks. Cortical thickness and brain connectivity were assessed as indicators of brain plasticity before training, immediately after training, and 3 months after training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Results showed that cortical thickness and brain connectivity were improved after strategy-based reasoning training, which focused on selective attention, abstract reasoning, and other cognitive strategies. Importantly, these improvements were evident even 3 months after training was completed, indicating a sustained effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNA vaccines for Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;DNA vaccines may be the next generation of vaccines. They are designed to induce the production of antigens through the action of genetically engineered DNA, thereby triggering a protective immunological response. Although they are not yet approved for human use, they have been showing interesting beneficial effects in pre-clinical research. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405538/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has tested a DNA A?42 trimer vaccine (targeting amyloid plaques) for its effect on experimental &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;It was shown that DNA A?42 immunization produced a high antibody response and that the antibodies generated after vaccination were able to detect amyloid plaques in the brain, suggesting a promising preventive effect for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cannabinoids for age-related cognitive decline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The activity of the endocannabinoid system declines during aging, with the expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the levels of the major endocannabinoid (2-AG) being reduced in the brain of older animals. In a letter published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4311&quot;&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, new data shows that a prolonged exposure to low doses of the cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive substance in cannabis) can reverse the age-related &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/29/running-from-aging-fitness-and-brain-health/&quot;&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in mice, improving spatial memory, long-term memory and learning flexibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; The effect was accompanied by an increase in synaptic density in the hippocampus and a restoration of hippocampal gene transcription to patterns similar to those of young animals. This indicates a potential beneficial effect of cannabinoids in treating age-related cognitive impairments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The worst&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep disturbances may increase the risk of dementia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Sleep disturbances are known to contribute to an overall deterioration of health. An association between &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/16/can-a-sleepwalker-feel-pain/&quot;&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt; and the development of dementia has also been proposed. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/4/329.long&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; aimed at determining if this association is indeed observable in population-based studies. A first phase of the study took place between 1984 and 1989, when data about the sleeping patterns of the participants was collected. The incidence of dementia in those participants was now assessed using data from health registries. It was found that the risk ratio for dementia was significantly higher in individuals with frequent sleep disturbances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maternal stress and fetal development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortin (UCN) are two proteins with important roles in both human stress regulation and pregnancy. Therefore, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10253890.2017.1312336&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the association between an acute stress response, social overload (as an indicator of chronic stress) and the levels of CRH and UCN in the amniotic fluid of healthy, second-trimester pregnant women. The analyzes revealed that an acute &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/24/9-personality-traits-putting-mothers-at-risk-of-postpartum-depression/&quot;&gt;maternal stress&lt;/a&gt; response was not associated with increased levels of the two peptides, but that maternal chronic social overload and amniotic CRH were positively correlated. Amniotic CRH was found to be able to influence fetal growth albeit in a non-linear way. This indicates that, although acute maternal stress may not be as influential, chronic maternal stress may affect the production of molecules, such as CRH, that can potentially influence fetal development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;tDCS does not improve the effect of cognitive training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested be able to enhance cognitive abilities when associated with cognitive training. This claim has been tested in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of 123 older adults, in whom the effects of 20 sessions of anodal tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex and simultaneous working memory training on cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/&quot;&gt;tDCS&lt;/a&gt; failed to improve the efficacy of cognitive training. A meta-analysis including younger and older individuals was also performed. It also indicated that tDCS is not effective at improving the effect of cognitive training in working memory and global cognition. It is possible that the inefficacy of tDCS may be due to an inadequacy of current tDCS protocols for enhancing the effects of cognitive training, indicating that those protocols may need to be optimized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The onset of cocaine addiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Cues associated with the consumption of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/05/diabetes-drug-for-addiction-treatment/&quot;&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; can lead to dopamine release in the striatum brain region. This response is believed to be associated with the the motivation to consume. The acquisition of drug-seeking behaviors is believed to be associated with conditioned dopamine responses in the ventral striatum. But as drug use continues and becomes a habit, the conditioned responses shift to the dorsal striatum, which may be associated with compulsive drug use and susceptibility to addiction. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405406/&quot;&gt;new study &lt;/a&gt;used PET imaging and&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;personalized cocaine cues to assess the pattern of the dopamine response in in recreational cocaine users without a substance use disorder. The results showed that the exposure to cues associated with the opportunity to use the drug increased the dopamine response in the dorsal striatum in recreational cocaine users. This indicates that a susceptibility to addiction may be developing even though there are no psychiatric signs of a substance abuse disorder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inflammation and oxidation in Huntington’s disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to play an important role in driving Huntington’s disease progression. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/06/how-prenatal-lead-exposure-results-in-neurodevelopmental-disorders/&quot;&gt;NRF2&lt;/a&gt; is a transcription factor with a chief role in regulating cellular anti-inflammatory and antioxidant defense genes. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/23/E4676.abstract&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has reveled that NRF2 activation was suppressed in neural stem cells of Huntington’s disease patients, suggesting that these cells may be abnormally susceptible to oxidative stress. On the bright side, it was shown that the pharmacological activation of NRF2 was able to decrease inflammatory responses in glial cells, the main cellular mediators of neuroinflammation, and in blood monocytes from Huntington’s disease patients. These findings also suggest that NRF2 may be an important therapeutic target in Huntington’s disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/28/the-effect-of-moose-harvest-remains-on-natural-ecosystems/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-collage-2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the boreal forest of Fennoscandia over 150,000 moose (&lt;em&gt;Alces alces&lt;/em&gt;) are harvested annually. Gut piles left in the field by hunters provide a large pulse of energy into the ecosystem, a potentially important food source for a range of scavenging predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased populations of these predators can negatively affect threatened or important game species. As a response to this, restrictions on field dressing of moose are under consideration in parts of Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used camera-trap data from 50 gut piles during 1043 monitoring days. Our research show that many species utilize gut piles, highlighting the potential importance of gut piles as a food source in the boreal ecosystem. Corvids (such as crows and ravens), medium-sized mammals, and raptors (such as golden eagles) were important scavengers in our study area, with corvids and the red fox (&lt;em&gt;Vulpes vulpes&lt;/em&gt;) the main scavengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9216&quot; style=&quot;width: 682px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9216&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-fig-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red foxes might be attracted by corvid activity during daytime. Here with five magpies (&lt;em&gt;Pica pica&lt;/em&gt;) and one hooded crow (&lt;em&gt;Corvus cornix&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corvids arrived first at the gut piles and could benefit from access to gut pile parts with the highest energy content. Corvid presence decreased with gut pile age, and we suggest that rather than feeding on parts with low energy content, corvids search for new gut piles when the energy rich parts are consumed, .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being quite abundant, corvids might limit mammal access to high energy content, as mammals in general arrive later at the gut piles. Hence, temporal and spatial variation in corvid density in the boreal ecosystem might affect the gut pile biomass available to mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammals scavenged on all parts of the gut piles, resulting in close to total consumption of the gut piles. The probability of mammal presence decreased at high gut pile densities. We suggest that this is due to a saturation effect – mammals can’t keep up with the input of fresh gut piles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During summer, surplus gut piles would probably be lost resources to mammals as gut piles would be consumed by insects, bacteria and fungi. Low temperatures prevent this during autumn, keeping surplus gut piles available for scavengers after the hunting season ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunting season ends in mid-November. Gut pile parts with low energy content accumulates during the hunting season, and are available in relatively high densities a month after the end of the hunting season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know little about how gut piles affect individual survival or population dynamics of scavenging species. However, many studies have shown positive effects from food subsidies on consumer species, and it is reasonable to assume that removing this large pulse of energy from the boreal forests of Fennoscandia would have a negative impact on some of the species scavenging on gut piles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to predict the long-term effect on the relative abundance of scavengers. Removing gut piles could potentially reduce less wanted species of corvids and red fox, but also impact less abundant species like raptors. Reducing the amount of gut piles in the landscape would on the other hand reduce the potential risk of lead poisoning from bullet fragments, an increasing concern in raptor conservation. However, to what extend this pulsed resource is important for the overall survival, reproduction and population dynamics of both scavenging and potential prey species needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us remember kids at school who seemed a little different – less sociable, more introverted and fragile, perhaps – and that they often seemed to be the ones to get picked on or rejected. Maybe you remember because you were one of those kids and you know what is was like to not fit in. Personality psychologists who study these things have partly backed this up: they’ve found that children and teens who score low in the “Big Five” traits of emotional stability, conscientiousness and agreeableness (similar to friendliness) are more likely to be bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course being different is relative, it depends a lot on the crowd you’re in. A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2105/full&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt; has looked into this, providing a more nuanced picture of how a teenager’s personality may place them at risk of being bullied. The results suggest that teenagers are more likely to be a victim of bullying if they have a personality that is unusual compared with what’s typical in their particular classroom. The researchers, led by Savannah Boele at Tilburg University, say their findings need to be extended and replicated, but they hope they could help teachers spot and support the kids in their class who are most likely to be bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25897&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from over a thousand pupils from six secondary schools in The Netherlands. Just under half were boys and the average age of the sample was 13.5 years.  All the participants completed measures of their Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional instability, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness) and their “Dark Triad” traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism). The participants also stated who from their class had bullied them, if anyone, and who, if anyone, they had bullied. The kind of bullying – verbal or physical and so on, was not specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure classroom personality, the researchers identified the average rank order of the eight different personality traits across pupils for each class. For instance, the class might score highest on extraversion, on average, followed by agreeableness, then conscientiousness and so on. Each participant’s own personality profile, in terms of the rank order of their own traits, could then be compared with their class average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more different a participant’s personality profile was from their classroom’s average, the more likely they were to be named as victims of bullying by their peers (there was a trend for them to also be more likely to describe themselves as victims, but this didn’t reach statistical significance). The researchers said this result is in-line with “previous findings that youths who deviate from social norms are more likely to be rejected and perceived as low-status peers and hence at increased risk for being victimised by their peers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boele’s team also looked at participants’ specific personality traits and how these related to the class average. Discrepancies here were mostly related to describing oneself as a bullying victim, rather than being named as a victim. Specifically, having higher or lower extraversion, agreeableness or openness to experience than the classroom average was correlated with describing oneself as a victim of bullying. So too was having higher than average emotional instability or Machiavellianism, and lower than average psychopathy. In terms of being named as a victim, having higher than average emotional instability was a correlate, as was having higher or lower Machiavellianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are preliminary and there are some obvious gaps – actual acts of bullying were not recorded, but depended on participants’ own sense of victimisation or admissions of bullying others. This means, for example, that having a different level of extraversion than what’s typical for the class might be related to extra sensitivity towards potential slights, rather than to overt acts of bullying (given that scoring differently from the class average on extraversion, and some other traits, was related to self-identifying as a victim, but not being named as a victim). Another thing: how a teenager’s personality is perceived by their peers is also likely to be highly relevant but wasn’t measured in this study, which relied entirely on participants’ descriptions of their own personalities. Finally, remember the data are correlational, so it’s possible being bullied affects teens’ personalities, rather than, or as well as, their personalities affecting their risk of being bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So more research needed, but this paper makes an important contribution to the literature, being the first study to provide evidence that having a personality that’s different from the classroom average can be a risk factor for being bullied.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Climate change drives expansion of Antarctic ice-free habitat</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/vEZWR4W2mZ4/nature22996</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity occurs almost exclusively in ice-free areas that cover less than 1% of the continent. Climate change will alter the extent and configuration of ice-free areas, yet the distribution and severity of these effects remain unclear. Here we quantify the impact of twenty-first century climate change on ice-free areas under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate forcing scenarios using temperature-index melt modelling. Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over 17,000 km2 by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Tracing the origins of relapse in acute myeloid leukaemia to stem cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/tEdrQvmj2AQ/nature22993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In acute myeloid leukaemia, long-term survival is poor as most patients relapse despite achieving remission. Historically, the failure of therapy has been thought to be due to mutations that produce drug resistance, possibly arising as a consequence of the mutagenic properties of chemotherapy drugs. However, other lines of evidence have pointed to the pre-existence of drug-resistant cells. For example, deep sequencing of paired diagnosis and relapse acute myeloid leukaemia samples has provided direct evidence that relapse in some cases is generated from minor genetic subclones present at diagnosis that survive chemotherapy, suggesting that resistant cells are generated by evolutionary processes before treatment and are selected by therapy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of therapy failure and capacity for leukaemic regeneration remain obscure, as sequence analysis alone does not provide insight into the cell types that are fated to drive relapse. Although leukaemia stem cells have been linked to relapse owing to their dormancy and self-renewal properties, and leukaemia stem cell gene expression signatures are highly predictive of therapy failure, experimental studies have been primarily correlative and a role for leukaemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia relapse has not been directly proved. Here, through combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identify therapy-resistant cells already present at diagnosis and two major patterns of relapse. In some cases, relapse originated from rare leukaemia stem cells with a haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell phenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from larger subclones of immunophenotypically committed leukaemia cells that retained strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, the shared functional and transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of relapse emphasize the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that target stemness to prevent relapse.

 Genomic analysis of tumours has led to the identification of hundreds of cancer genes on the basis of the presence of mutations in protein-coding regions. By contrast, much less is known about cancer-causing mutations in non-coding regions. Here we perform deep sequencing in 360 primary breast cancers and develop computational methods to identify significantly mutated promoters. Clear signals are found in the promoters of three genes. FOXA1, a known driver of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, harbours a mutational hotspot in its promoter leading to overexpression through increased E2F binding. RMRP and NEAT1, two non-coding RNA genes, carry mutations that affect protein binding to their promoters and alter expression levels. Our study shows that promoter regions harbour recurrent mutations in cancer with functional consequences and that the mutations occur at similar frequencies as in coding regions. Power analyses indicate that more such regions remain to be discovered through deep sequencing of adequately sized cohorts of patients.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: RNase III nucleases from diverse kingdoms serve as antiviral effectors</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In contrast to the DNA-based viruses in prokaryotes, the emergence of eukaryotes provided the necessary compartmentalization and membranous environment for RNA viruses to flourish, creating the need for an RNA-targeting antiviral system. Present day eukaryotes employ at least two main defence strategies that emerged as a result of this viral shift, namely antiviral RNA interference and the interferon system. Here we demonstrate that Drosha and related RNase III ribonucleases from all three domains of life also elicit a unique RNA-targeting antiviral activity. Systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment of this class of proteins illustrates the recognition of unbranched RNA stem loops. Biochemical analyses reveal that, in this context, Drosha functions as an antiviral clamp, conferring steric hindrance on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses. We present evidence for cytoplasmic translocation of RNase III nucleases in response to virus in diverse eukaryotes including plants, arthropods, fish, and mammals. These data implicate RNase III recognition of viral RNA as an antiviral defence that is independent of, and possibly predates, other known eukaryotic antiviral systems.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Whole-body imaging of lymphovascular niches identifies pre-metastatic roles of midkine</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/eQt6_qV12ws/nature22977</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Cutaneous melanoma is a type of cancer with an inherent potential for lymph node colonization, which is generally preceded by neolymphangiogenesis. However, sentinel lymph node removal does not necessarily extend the overall survival of patients with melanoma. Moreover, lymphatic vessels collapse and become dysfunctional as melanomas progress. Therefore, it is unclear whether (and how) lymphangiogenesis contributes to visceral metastasis. Soluble and vesicle-associated proteins secreted by tumours and/or their stroma have been proposed to condition pre-metastatic sites in patients with melanoma. Still, the identities and prognostic value of lymphangiogenic mediators remain unclear. Moreover, our understanding of lymphangiogenesis (in melanomas and other tumour types) is limited by the paucity of mouse models for live imaging of distal pre-metastatic niches. Injectable lymphatic tracers have been developed, but their limited diffusion precludes whole-body imaging at visceral sites. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is an attractive ‘lymphoreporter’ because its expression is strongly downregulated in normal adult lymphatic endothelial cells, but is activated in pathological situations such as inflammation and cancer. Here, we exploit this inducibility of VEGFR3 to engineer mouse melanoma models for whole-body imaging of metastasis generated by human cells, clinical biopsies or endogenously deregulated oncogenic pathways. This strategy revealed early induction of distal pre-metastatic niches uncoupled from lymphangiogenesis at primary lesions. Analyses of the melanoma secretome and validation in clinical specimens showed that the heparin-binding factor midkine is a systemic inducer of neo-lymphangiogenesis that defines patient prognosis. This role of midkine was linked to a paracrine activation of the mTOR pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells. These data support the use of VEGFR3 reporter mice as a ‘MetAlert’ discovery platform for drivers and inhibitors of metastasis.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Fine-mapping inflammatory bowel disease loci to single-variant resolution</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/u-I8Mjp67Tc/nature22969</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n = 13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n = 3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n = 10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn’s disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: mTORC1-dependent AMD1 regulation sustains polyamine metabolism in prostate cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/2EqUpDINqTk/nature22964</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Activation of the PTEN–PI3K–mTORC1 pathway consolidates metabolic programs that sustain cancer cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates polyamine dynamics, a metabolic route that is essential for oncogenicity. By using integrative metabolomics in a mouse model and human biopsies of prostate cancer, we identify alterations in tumours affecting the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) and polyamine synthesis. Mechanistically, this metabolic rewiring stems from mTORC1-dependent regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) stability. This novel molecular regulation is validated in mouse and human cancer specimens. AMD1 is upregulated in human prostate cancer with activated mTORC1. Conversely, samples from a clinical trial with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus exhibit a predominant decrease in AMD1 immunoreactivity that is associated with a decrease in proliferation, in line with the requirement of dcSAM production for oncogenicity. These findings provide fundamental information about the complex regulatory landscape controlled by mTORC1 to integrate and translate growth signals into an oncogenic metabolic program.

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: The brain basis of “hatred of sound:” Misophonia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/MqmQWwmdYis/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/06/5499502593_84981c67d2_z-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Munch, munch, munch.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, the sounds of our lunch date chewing or a coworker clicking their pen are everyday components of an auditory landscape that go largely unnoticed. But for others, these seemingly mundane sounds are painfully unpleasant to the point of eliciting uncontrollable irritation or rage. There is ongoing disagreement as to whether this &lt;em&gt;hatred of sound&lt;/em&gt;, termed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508801&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;, should be recognized as a legitimate psychiatric disorder, and many sufferers continue to shamefully hide their extreme emotional responses to common sounds. But a recent surge in interest in misophonia is encouraging many to acknowledge that they suffer from the condition, and some medical professionals to accept that this reaction to otherwise neutral auditory stimuli reflects a veritable disorder. A flurry of research, aimed to characterize its behavioral manifestations and outline diagnostic criteria, has appeared over the past decade, though few studies have sought to determine the neural underpinnings of misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characterizing the “hatred of sound”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since “misophonia” was &lt;a href=&quot;http://w.tinnitus.org/DST_NL2_PJMJ.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first coined&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2000’s, efforts have been made to characterize its symptoms through patient interview. Although its prevalence remains uncertain due to its still relative obscurity, studies suggest that it typically strikes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt;, affects men and women equally, and may occur in much as 20% of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752915&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;population&lt;/a&gt;. The most commonly reported trigger sounds include eating, breathing or repetitive behaviors like typing or pen clicking. Hearing such sounds often evokes uncontrollable irritation, disgust or anger, which the individual recognizes as socially inappropriate. Therefore, the misophonic may try to suppress any outward reaction, with few acting upon their urges with verbal or physical aggression. These aversive responses in fact manifest as measurable physiological arousal. Compared to healthy controls, misophonic individuals have &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;excessive skin conductance responses&lt;/a&gt; to auditory stimuli, and the magnitude of these skin responses correlates with how distressing the participants perceive the sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An undiagnosed disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of misophonia largely overlap with other clinically accepted psychiatric disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and various phobias. Some individuals reporting misophonic symptoms also have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondria, OCD, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Although some &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experts advise&lt;/a&gt; that misophonia be identified as a unique psychiatric disorder, it has yet to be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Miren Edelstein, a graduate student at the University of California San Diego who researches misophonia, explains that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The uncertainty surrounding the official status of misophonia as a discrete disorder stems from the fact that it does indeed have some similarities with other existing conditions. However, while some misophonics definitely do suffer from some of these other existing conditions, many do not and report no other ailments whatsoever. Because of this variation, I don’t believe another existing disorder can completely account for the specific constellation of symptoms present in misophonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The misophonic brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an advancing understanding of the psychological and behavioral manifestations of misophonia, little research has attempted to clarify its neurobiological bases. Researchers suspect that misophonia is not a primary auditory disorder, but rather stems from aberrant attentional or emotional processing later in the brain’s auditory system. There is preliminary support for this explanation from one small &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00123&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EEG study&lt;/a&gt;. In an oddball auditory paradigm, misophonic participants showed a smaller N1 evoked potential than controls elicited by unexpected auditory tones, whereas the “pre-attentive” P1 component showed no group difference. The N1 is involved in early attention and detecting sensory changes, suggesting that abnormal attentional signaling early in the auditory processing stream may contribute to misophonia. Interestingly, an altered N1 peak has also been associated with impulsivity, drug abuse and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321671/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers used fMRI&lt;/a&gt; to examine brain activity in misophonic individuals while they listened to sounds that were neutral, unpleasant or characteristic misophonia triggers. The misophonics rated the trigger sounds as more distressing than the unpleasant or neutral sounds, whereas normal controls rated trigger and unpleasant sounds as similarly annoying, confirming a selective intolerance for triggers by misophonics. Critically, the misophonics showed greater activation in the insula than controls during trigger sounds, and this activity increased with greater reported distress. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the insula and other brain regions involved in attention and emotion was altered in misophonics when listening to trigger sounds. Although the insula has been promiscuously implicated in a plethora of cognitive processes, its proposed functions include internal awareness of one’s body and emotional states. Though preliminary, these findings suggest that misophonia is associated with pathological activation of a brain network supporting interception. Edelstein, who was not involved in this study, comments “There was a huge gap in the literature until recently. I think this study was a triumphant effort towards gleaning neurophysiological insights on misophonia and its findings fit nicely into the narrative emerging from behavioral research on misophonia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also been proposed that altered brain connectivity underlying misophonia may be similar to that occurring in synesthesia, a condition in which one sensory stimulus evokes sensation in a different modality (e.g., the letter “A” is associated with the color red). Faulty enhanced neural connections could theoretically lead to abnormal associations amongst sensory and emotional brain regions in misophonia, although this hypothesis remains untested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacifying sound distress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the novelty of misophonia, effective therapies have been inadequately assessed. However, there is some support for the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032716321681&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0034-1372527&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conditioning retraining&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, with further research into both its psychological profile and neurobiological underpinnings, misophonia will gain both greater social acceptance and effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>A new study examines the blurry distinction between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs.



The &quot;hardness&quot; of drugs is a concept that makes intuitive sense, but is difficult to put into precise terms. &quot;Hard&quot; drugs are those which are viewed as more addictive, more potent and more toxic than the comparatively benign &quot;soft&quot; variety. The concept has a normative aspect: &quot;hard&quot; drugs are bad, and you should avoid them, even if you use soft drugs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evasive politicians tend to pay for their slipperiness, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X17706960&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Journal of Language and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;. To study the art of the dodge, David Clementson of Ohio State University created videos of a male politician with no obvious party affiliation (he was played by an actor, but the participants thought he was a real politician), who was quizzed on a number of topics by a news reporter. In some versions of the video the politician played it entirely straight, but in others he dodged one of the questions, either by switching topics, or by giving a terse “no comment”. Either evasion led to the politician being rated as less trustworthy, both by a young group of 200 American university students, and a more seasoned group of 200 US citizens with an average age of 57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25859&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clementson also looked at whether participants’ political leanings made any difference. He found those who more strongly affiliated with the Republican party were less likely to notice the politician refusing to answer a question. However, compared to politically unaligned participants, both affiliated Republicans and Democrats alike were more likely to spot when the politician swapped topics, perhaps because once you notice this technique used by your political enemies, it begins to jump out at you. This study used an unaffiliated politician as the question-dodger; future work could present partisan figures to whether we turn a blind eye to slipperiness on our own side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results seem to suggest that observing a politician dodge a question influences our attitude about their trustworthiness. But it’s also possible that our existing attitude affects whether we observe the dodge in the first place – perhaps we’re less likely to spot dodges made by people we trust. This study design can’t answer this for certain, but Clementson conducted some further statistical analysis and based on this he thinks there’s some causality in both directions. If so, it’s all the more reason for us to pay attention to the facts of the matter, and not mere appearances: detect, or get dodged on.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=8886</link>
	<content:encoded>I've recently been doing some of every academic's favorite activity - marking student essays (papers).



Here's a few observations on essays and on marking them.



1. Marking Essays is Subjective

This is a bit of a truism: it's fairly obvious that not everyone will agree on how to grade an essay down to the exact mark. Unlike with, say, a multiple-choice exam, marking an essay is not a mechanical process. But it's easy to forget this when the marks are there in black and white (or r</content:encoded>

	<title>Ankur Sinha: A channel for neuroscientists on Gitter</title>
	<link>http://ankursinha.in/blog/2017/06/26/a-channel-for-neuroscientists-on-gitter.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the free software community, where I've been around long enough to know what's where, I'm still relatively new to the neuroscience community. Over the two years that I've been doing my PhD, I've found a few neuroscience related mailing lists, but not any chat channels. Various teams tend to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or another platform for internal communications, but nothing seems to be set up for the community in general - an open for all channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailing lists are extremely useful, but by design they are suited to particular types of tasks. They are very well suited for longer discussions, and general queries that are not time sensitive, for example. On the other hand, they do not work well for urgent queries, and of course, sometimes sending e-mails back and forth is quite an overhead for simpler tasks or collaborative development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most open source communities have both mailing lists and chat channels. I figured it'd be nice to have one for the neuroscience community too. There's the question of what platform was best suited, of course. We use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; for our internal communication, but &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; only works well for small teams. It isn't designed for larger communities. The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; is ideal for larger communities, but on the flip side, the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; is not very user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third option, and the popular alternative to IRC and Slack, is &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/gitterHQ&quot;&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; - it's been recently &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/03/15/gitter-acquisition/&quot;&gt;acquired by GitLab&lt;/a&gt; and will be completely open sourced soon. It's completely free to use unlike &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; where one needs to pay more as the number of group members increases, and is designed for large communities that number in the thousands. One can login using either Github or Twitter - so that's quite convenient too. There's even an &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://irc.gitter.im/&quot;&gt;IRC gateway&lt;/a&gt; for more technical users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the channel then - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby&quot;&gt;https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby&lt;/a&gt;. I hope it'll be useful, and if it doesn't, well no harm done :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Self-control has been dubbed a “master virtue” – one which enables so many others, such as selflessness and perseverance. Indeed, better control of short-term impulses in conflict with long-term goals is linked to everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21300864&quot;&gt;greater health to greater wealth&lt;/a&gt;. It’s no surprise, then, that schools are adopting strategies designed to improve their students’ self-control, under the assumption that there is no downside. But is there…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have argued that there might be. High levels of self-control might promote obsessive-compulsive tendencies, or a dysfunctional kind of perfectionism, in which a person rigidly strives for unreachable standards. Another potential downside has been suggested: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393523&quot;&gt;“Too much” self-control&lt;/a&gt; might lead to “frequent and sometimes unnecessary regulation of emotions, thoughts and behaviours, resulting in a life marked by rigidity and blandness, thereby lowering subjective wellbeing” note the authors of a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12322/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-25833&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there’s been little actual research to investigate the interplay between changing levels of self-control and wellbeing. So the team – led by Christopher Wiese at Purdue University and including Roy Baumeister of willpower fame and Angela Duckworth, known for her work on “grit” –  ran a series of six studies involving a total of more than 5,000 schoolchildren, college undergraduates and adults aged up to 55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, middle-school children (aged 10-14) completed a questionnaire about their impulsivity, their teachers also rated the kids’ self-control, and the children also reported their subjective wellbeing, including how often they experienced positive and negative moods and their overall life satisfaction. This allowed the researchers to see if having especially high or low self-control was related to feelings of well being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies with university students and a community sample of adults were similar, but in one case there was a real-world test of the ability to resist temptation, which involved persisting with a boring computer task while resisting fun distractions. Another of the studies used a “day reconstruction method”, in which participants recalled how much self-control they had exercised during different activities in a given day, and how they had felt during each activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of all these investigations? In the researchers’ words, “Self-control enhances subjective wellbeing with little to no apparent downside of too much self-control.” The “little” cost to well being that they did find related to the giving up of immediate pleasures for future gain. Since “these [future] benefits outweigh the loss of in-the-moment pleasures,” the net result was  “overall higher [subjective wellbeing],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few limitations with the research. Perhaps most glaring was the lack of longitudinal data (the same participants were not followed over time) or any kind of experimental test to see the consequences of exercising different levels of self-control. This meant the researchers couldn’t explore, for example, whether people may start to feel less good about repeatedly exerting self-control in the long term. It also means it’s not possible to say based on this research whether over periods of weeks, months and years, self-control affects well being levels, or if happier people simply tend to exert more self-control. However, the researchers said they believe their results provide “preliminary support” for promoting self-control among school-aged children, as well as in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12322/abstract&quot;&gt;Too much of a good thing? Exploring the inverted-U relationship between self-control and happiness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/featured-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The western honeybee &lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt; is probably one of the most famous pollinators and has a key role in the terrestrial ecosystem. Humans have domesticated honeybees for perhaps more than 9000 years, but wild populations still exist. As beekeeping became more global, honeybees were moved out their native area and are now nearly cosmopolitan. Their wide geographic distribution shows that honeybees have the ability to adapt to very different new environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, &lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt; was distributed only in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and some parts of Asia. The exact point of origin of the western honeybee is still hard to identify, but over the last decades, five major evolutionary groups have been defined. The evolutionary complexity does not stop there, as honeybees have evolved no less than 31 recognized subspecies that can readily hybridize. The most famous example to date is the Africanized honeybee, the result of admixture between the divergent African and European lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9194&quot; style=&quot;width: 943px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9194 size-full&quot; height=&quot;622&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/hive.png&quot; width=&quot;933&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Example of beehives in an apiary on La Réunion © M. TECHER&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its intimate relationship with human movements, it can be rather hard to be sure about the honeybee presence in some regions. This difficulty is even more relevant for young isolated island systems in which the natural history before human arrival is often unclear or non-exhaustive. One illustration of such a case is the honeybee populations from the South West Indian Ocean islands (SWIO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this area, Madagascar and three archipelagos form one of the major hotspots of biodiversity with a high proportion of endemic species. In 1804, Pierre André Latreille described a honeybee subspecies &lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera unicolor&lt;/em&gt; that is endemic to Madagascar. It is open to debate as to whether honeybees were present in the Mascarene, Seychelles and Comoros archipelagos before humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about its status were raised because of reported importations in the Mascarene and Seychelles archipelagos. Indeed, the influence of beekeeping was previously proven in Rodrigues (the far-eastern island of the Mascarenes) as a genetic study showed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-014-0335-9&quot;&gt;exclusive presence of European Carnolian and Italian honeybees.&lt;/a&gt; However, this situation was exceptional as &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12138/abstract.&quot;&gt;Seychelles honeybees were African and genetically related to &lt;em&gt;A. m. unicolor&lt;/em&gt; from Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9193&quot; style=&quot;width: 1395px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9193&quot; height=&quot;855&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/bee.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1385&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;unicolor&lt;/em&gt; worker © A. FRANCK – CIRAD&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given such contrasting patterns, it seemed rather complicated to predict which lineages or subspecies were present in the rest of the SWIO islands. In our latest mitochondrial study, the ancestral genetic identity of honeybees from the Mascarene and Comoros was partly unraveled. Using one of the largest sampling efforts conducted for honeybees in African regions, we helped to retrace the maternal ancestry lineage using two markers. The genetic diversity observed was compared to potential source populations like Madagascar and 19 continental countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the results showed that SWIO honeybees mainly presented &lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera unicolor&lt;/em&gt; sequences in 10 islands out of the 11 targeted (all except Rodrigues). Not only were the honeybees from the archipelagos more closely related to Madagascar, but they formed with it a novel African mitochondrial group. One way for these honeybees to reach these isolated islands despite the ocean barrier would have been &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; human importations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New private &lt;em&gt;A. m. unicolor&lt;/em&gt; derivated sequences found in each of the SWIO islands suggested an alternative hypothesis. This finding more likely points towards a long independent evolution among islands after colonization. It is not new that species that originated from Madagascar were able to cross the ocean barrier and colonize nearby islands. The distance between the islands could have been reduced with sea level fluctuations and/or hurricanes. As the Comoros archipelago diversity suggests, honeybees could have progressively colonized the islands, beginning with the nearest island to the mainland before moving from one neighbouring island to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these elements support the theory that honeybees could be native to the SWIO archipelagos. Still, European lineage was also retrieved in different frequencies in the Mascarene archipelago, revealing human impact. Until recently, honeybees from these islands were preserved from major worldwide pests such as &lt;em&gt;Varroa destructor&lt;/em&gt; thanks to importation restrictions. The diversity of honeybees in the SWIO islands constitutes a unique heritage that deserves special attention.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Electron cryo-microscopy structure of the mechanotransduction channel NOMPC</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/rocAaPQ0o2M/nature22981</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Mechanosensory transduction for senses such as proprioception, touch, balance, acceleration, hearing and pain relies on mechanotransduction channels, which convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in specialized sensory cells. How force gates mechanotransduction channels is a central question in the field, for which there are two major models. One is the membrane-tension model: force applied to the membrane generates a change in membrane tension that is sufficient to gate the channel, as in the bacterial MscL channel and certain eukaryotic potassium channels. The other is the tether model: force is transmitted via a tether to gate the channel. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel NOMPC is important for mechanosensation-related behaviours such as locomotion, touch and sound sensation across different species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish. NOMPC is the founding member of the TRPN subfamily, and is thought to be gated by tethering of its ankyrin repeat domain to microtubules of the cytoskeleton. Thus, a goal of studying NOMPC is to reveal the underlying mechanism of force-induced gating, which could serve as a paradigm of the tether model. NOMPC fulfils all the criteria that apply to mechanotransduction channels and has 29 ankyrin repeats, the largest number among TRP channels. A key question is how the long ankyrin repeat domain is organized as a tether that can trigger channel gating. Here we present a de novo atomic structure of Drosophila NOMPC determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. Structural analysis suggests that the ankyrin repeat domain of NOMPC resembles a helical spring, suggesting its role of linking mechanical displacement of the cytoskeleton to the opening of the channel. The NOMPC architecture underscores the basis of translating mechanical force into an electrical signal within a cell.

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Photo-3-140x110.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrant children are at risk of a variety of physical and mental health problems as a result of their limited access to quality health care, the increased prevalence of infectious diseases in their home countries and the difficult conditions they experience during the process of migration. Many of these conditions are manageable, and if undiagnosed or left untreated, could lead to significant unfavorable health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, Greece has been experiencing increased mobility of various populations across its borders. However, there are limited data and information with regards to their health particularly in the case of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recently published  study in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-017-0888-7&quot;&gt;Clinical and laboratory evaluation of new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece&lt;/a&gt;), we prospectively examined all immigrant and refugee children that attended a special outpatient clinic at a large tertiary Children’s Hospital, in Athens, Greece to obtain a health evaluation, within three months of their arrival in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of vaccination records and bad oral health were the most prevalent clinical issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigrants were defined as children of parents with long-term residence permit entering for family reunification while refugees, asylum seekers or irregular migrants were defined as refugees. Among both groups, we identified distinct clinical problems and certain laboratory abnormalities that differed according to their migration status, age and region of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inadequate immunization status (insufficient number, inadequate serologic response due to improper storage of vaccinations, or severe malnutrition) places migrant children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. 80% of the children in the study had no documentation of vaccination, and this was more prominent among the population of refugees, while bad oral health and especially caries was found in more than 20% of them. A number of children presented with respiratory and skin infections and additional clinical conditions requiring intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9207&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9207&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/MSF1-High.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Photo from the recent vaccination campaign in Greece for refugee children by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40% of migrant children presented lack of protective antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs ≥ 10 IU/L), nevertheless, no child was found to be a chronic HBsAg carrier. Latent tuberculosis was detected in 2.7% of our study individuals, and all received BCG vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of protective antibodies against hepatitis B virus, Lead exposure, eosinophilia, anemia and low ferritin were the most common laboratory abnormalities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well recognized that Lead exposure is the most widespread exposure among migrant children and may have deleterious, long term neurotoxic effects. In one third of our study population, we identified elevated blood lead levels and the odds were increased among younger children, immigrants and those originating from Asia. Additionally, younger children had increased probability of anemia and low ferritin levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume, speed, and diversity of migration in Greece amid the current socioeconomic crisis are additional challenges we face in providing access to health care services to all migrants. It is evident that collaboration with nongovernmental institutions and health providers at national as well as at international levels is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Euthanasia for people with psychiatric disorders or dementia</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/23/euthanasia-for-people-with-psychiatric-disorders-or-dementia/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/anniemokillustration-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euthanasia, i.e. the ending of a patient’s life by a physician on explicit patient request, on the grounds of unbearable suffering caused by mental illness is legal only in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Strict due care and procedural criteria are set out to ensure careful practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option of euthanasia is increasingly being considered and discussed in a growing number of countries. Euthanasia remains however a controversial issue, especially when it concerns people suffering from a mental illness, such as major depressive disorder or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of euthanasia cases in Belgium has been increasing year by year since implementation of the euthanasia law in 2002. Euthanasia is &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2426426&quot;&gt;most common in cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;: in 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://overlegorganen.gezondheid.belgie.be/nl/documenten/fcee-euthanasie-verslag-2016&quot;&gt;68%&lt;/a&gt; of all reported cases involved people diagnosed with cancer. In previous years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2016/09/12/cmaj.160202.abstract&quot;&gt;we found a notable increase in deaths from euthanasia in people with conditions other than cancer, and in those without terminal illness&lt;/a&gt;, including people with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the specific difficulties associated with handling euthanasia requests expressed by people suffering from mental illness, a thorough examination of the practice is vital. Our study adds to and informs the international debate on medically assisted dying in general and in people with mental illness specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the procedural criteria for careful euthanasia practice is an obligation of the attending physician to report the euthanasia case for review to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://overlegorganen.gezondheid.belgie.be/nl/advies-en-overlegorgaan/commissies/federale-controle-en-evaluatiecommissie-euthanasie&quot;&gt;Federal Control and Evaluation Committee for Euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;. Information on the euthanasia cases is collected through a standardized registration form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Committee collects the anonymous information from the registration forms in a database, which we were allowed to use for research purposes. In our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1369-0&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, we report these data from the start of legalization of euthanasia in 2002 until 2013, which are the latest available data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-7328 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/01/Dementia1-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Our study shows that the number and proportion of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis has increased from 2008 onwards to 3.0% of all cases reported in 2013 (54 cases in 2013). This increase is particularly visible in cases with a diagnosis of mood disorder. In comparison with the total number of reported cases, euthanasia for these specific patient groups remains a limited practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in the absolute number of cases is particularly evident in cases with a mood disorder diagnosis. The majority of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis concerned women, ranging from 58.1% in people with dementia to 77.1% in people suffering from mood disorders. All notified cases were judged to comply with the due care criteria specified in the Belgian euthanasia law by the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the highly controversial nature of the practice and the specific complexities associated with handling euthanasia requests expressed by people with mental illness, we strongly recommend more in-depth research on patients’ reasons and physicians’ procedures, as well as on the impact on the family and health care professionals involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluation of a euthanasia request is a complex and challenging task for physicians, particularly when a request is based on psychological or existential suffering. Therefore, development of relevant practice guidelines is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1369-0&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; studying euthanasia in the most controversial of patient groups suggests that the legal possibilities of euthanasia legislation are being explored more broadly and have become more and more accepted over the past years in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our autobiographical memory is fundamental to the development of our sense of self. However, according to past research, it may be compromised in autism, together with other skills that are also vital for self understanding, such as introspection and the ability to attribute mental states to others (known as mentalising).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, experiments involving autistic children have highlighted retrieval difficulties, “impoverished narratives”, and a greater need for prompting, while also suggesting that semantic recall (facts from the past) may be impaired in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a UK research team, led by Sally Robinson from London’s St. Thomas’ Hospital, has published the first attempt to assess the nature of – and relationships between – autobiographical memory, mentalising and introspection in autism. Reporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1362361316645429&quot;&gt;their findings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Autism&lt;/i&gt; journal, the group hope their results will shed more light on the way that autistic children and teens develop a sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared the performance of 24 autistic participants (age range: 11-18; 4 girls) and 24 age- and gender-matched neurotypical participants on three tasks. The first, designed to tap semantic and episodic aspects of autobiographical memory, required them to recall what kind of personality they showed in different contexts (at school, with the family, when happy etc) and to describe specific episodes from their lives in which they’d behaved as that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second, interview task measured introspection and mentalising: participants rated both their own ability, and that of a nominated comparison individual (such as a friend or relative), to recognise both their own and the other person’s internal/external traits, such as tiredness (internal trait) or smartness of dress (external). For example, in relation to tiredness, participants rated “How well do you know when you feel tired?”; “How well does X know when you are tired?”; “How well do you know when X feels tired?”; and “How well does X know when he/she feels tired?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final task was the widely used mentalising measure, the Reading The Mind In The Eyes Task for children, which involved participants looking at pictures showing only the eye region of person’s face and inferring their mental state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results demonstrated impaired &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; preserved abilities in the autistic group, while suggesting atypical relationships between skills. In terms of autobiographical memory, the autistic children and teens: a) produced fewer self-descriptive personality traits than the neurotypical group, b) required more prompting to generate specific episodic memories, c) provided fewer memories containing either emotional or sensory detail, but d) &lt;i&gt;did not&lt;/i&gt; differ in terms of the number or type of episodic memories recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the autistic group recalled a typical number of episodic memories, albeit with greater prompting and atypicality of content, is broadly in line with previous work. The recall of fewer own personality traits, however, is a new finding, and is worth investigating further. This may suggest that autistic individuals’ self-concept is atypical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the introspection and mentalising interview, the autistic children and teens (a) rated themselves poorer at knowing about another’s mental state than did the neurotypical group, and b) more surprisingly, they rated others as having more knowledge about their own external/behavioural traits than they did themselves. The researchers suggested that this last finding may betray a lack of confidence in making objective/comparative behavioural judgments – as opposed to subjective internal ones – about the self in relation to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this, among the autistic children and teens only, if they rated themselves as having a high level of self-knowledge, they were also more likely to rate others as having a higher knowledge of them. The researchers pointed out that this may highlight the use of introspection as a compensatory strategy in autism, when attributing mental states to others, and that this may play a role in autistic individuals’ documented tendency to over-attribute their own beliefs and knowledge to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the autistic children and teens were poorer than controls on the Eyes Task, another indication of compromised mentalising skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a group difference in how the various skills related to each other. In the neurotypical group, performance correlated across the tasks: semantic/episodic autobiographical memory, introspecting and mentalising, which indicates how, in typical development, autobiographical memory has a reciprocal relationship with other aspects of the self-concept. In the autistic children and teens, these correlations were absent, suggesting that this reciprocity between mental processes may be impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this study is exploratory and more work is needed, it provides a finer-grained glimpse at how skills associated with self-understanding may interact in autism, and how this may differ from the equivalent processes in typical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings may also have implications for autistic children undertaking Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), an approach where the recall of autobiographical events is important. CBT is commonly used with autistic people to address anxiety and social skill development. In the new research, the autistic group generated as many episodic memories as controls, after having first described their own personality traits. This may suggest that in CBT with autism, accurate episodic retrieval could be supported by first encouraging individuals to reflect on their own personalities in a more general sense.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: You need to get out more. Occupation could be a major risk factor in vitamin D deficiency</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/business-792176_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week in the UK we’ve been experiencing a heat wave which has left many sweltering in the sun and seeking any available shade. We all know the dangers of sun exposure to our skin but we perhaps overlook the important benefits that it provides through vitamin D synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is important for the body in several ways and possessing inadequate amounts has been linked to autoimmune conditions; metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders; as well as cancers and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can obtain vitamin D through our diets but an estimated 90% is produced endogenously in healthy adults. To do this our bodies synthesize vitamin D from solar ultraviolet B radiation, making sunlight an essential factor in obtaining recommended vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D deficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide and even those in sunny locations are at risk of being deficient. Modern occupations trending towards indoor work are likely to play a big role in this as decreased time spent outdoors would be expected to lead to decreased vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to more fully understand the role that occupations play on vitamin D levels and identify those groups at the greatest risk, researchers at the University of Alberta,  Canada performed a systematic review of 71 papers with large population based cohorts that defined occupational groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that across all occupational groups, serum 25-(OH)D levels (a measure of vitamin D status in individuals) were below recommendations for optimal levels that are recommended by the Endocrine Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%). Deficiency levels for practicing physicians, nurses and a group termed ‘other healthcare employees’ were all below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study are consistent with an assumption that workers in an indoor environment would display lower levels of vitamin D compared to those working in outdoor environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author’s state that the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in healthcare students and medical residence (72% and 65% respectively) could be due to long working hours combined with additional time spent studying, leading to considerable time spent indoors. This is an alarming find given low vitamin D in young adults may decrease bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most worrying statistic is the high levels of vitamin D deficiency seen in shift workers. This deficiency has previously been suggested to be associated with shift workers’ predisposition for musculoskeletal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However drawing conclusions on this is complicated given that shift workers may work at various times of the day and may spend more time in daylight outside of conventional working hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the high prevalence vitamin D deficiency in shift workers, the authors call for regular screenings of these and other high risk groups to be considered in future clinical practice guidelines. They also call for education on the importance of healthy vitamin D levels, both through sun exposure and dietary intake, to be incorporated into workplace wellness programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside, giving their skin more exposure to UV light. This could be aided by revised work schedules allowing for such breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether you’re parked by a fan in the midst of a heat wave or confining yourself to an office all day, provided that you avoid excessive exposure, it may be a good idea to venture outside and soak up some sun.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The bumpy transition from student to junior doctor – an unseen struggle</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/22/the-bumpy-transition-from-student-to-junior-doctor-an-unseen-struggle/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/doctor-563429_960_720-medical-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping up from medical student to junior doctor is known to be a daunting and challenging transition. Though being stretched and ‘thrown in the deep end’ can be beneficial to their learning experience, it also increases stress. While getting to grips with the role in long shifts, they are also responsible for patient care. Can their job role and commitment for patient care be associated with poorer self-care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question was investigated by researchers at the &lt;em&gt;Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland&lt;/em&gt;, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0931-2&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Dr. Sturman, who reported the experiences junior doctors had during their career development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9183 alignright&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/medical-563427_960_720-pixabay-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;339&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junior doctors were recruited from a range of hospital settings, and interviewed to find out about their experiences when adjusting from the role of medical student to junior doctor. After this process, two clinical academics and an intern conducted a descriptive analysis of the information collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, some persistent concepts arose. Three main themes were ‘steep learning curve’, ‘relationships and team’ and ‘seeking help’. “There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student” one interviewee said. Overall, the participants described the transition as physically, mentally and emotionally draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key experiences were a decrease in confidence, self-care and social wellbeing. It seems that while the juniors were focused on caring for others, and were happy to raise patient related concerns  with senior staff members, there was an unwillingness to voice their own personal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and understand the cause for this, the researchers suggest some key factors in the professionals’ working environment, which may contribute to these negative impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supportive team structure which can alleviate the stress of this experience may be hindered by a divide being in place between senior staff and the junior doctors, as one participant implied – “You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disconnection between the staff can be further exacerbated by the movement of professionals to and from various teams within the hospital. As shallow relationships are maintained, not only the social wellbeing of the junior doctors, but their skills could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study speaks out to medical educators to raise awareness of the personal detriments experienced by junior doctors in this phase of learning, and suggests that improved team support systems and teaching methods could help smooth the bumpy transition from student to professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also voices the lessons learnt by junior doctors who have been through this stressful change, as one interviewee said “The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along, don’t be afraid to ask questions because ultimately it’s all in the best interest of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the wellbeing of junior doctors were to improve, perhaps this could also have a positive impact on their colleagues, and even the patients that they treat.&lt;/p&gt;
