&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barnes and her team discovered that most people found service provision confusing and difficult to access. In addition, benefit sanctions and preexisting mental health problems played a large role and many had the expectation that they should be self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study concludes that interventions are required to identify those in need so that they have guidance and access to practical and reliable advice. Listen to more in this podcast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet, old-fashioned circle time rituals involve young children sitting in a circle with a teacher and copying his or her specific actions as closely as possible. These rituals can seem a bit out of place in today’s culture with its emphasis on the importance of independent thinking, and the ubiquity of interactive educational games employing the latest beeps and whistles of technology. But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/cdev.12762/abstract&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt; says there is something about the conformity and attention to detail in ritualistic games that makes them a highly effective way to improve children’s executive functioning (their mental nimbleness) and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20174&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica Rybanska at the University of Oxford and her colleagues tested two groups of 7- and 8-year-old children, one from Slovakia, the other from Vanuatu in the Southwest Pacific. The children first completed tests of their executive functioning and self control. The executive functioning test involved learning to respond accurately to reversed commands, such as touching toes when hearing the command “touch your knees”. The self control test was a version of Walter Mischel’s classic Marshmallow Test: if the children could resist eating a single piece of chocolate for 15 minutes, they could have three afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, for three months, some of the children undertook 35-minutes of circle time games twice per week (others acted as controls and didn’t perform these games). The games involved things like dancing, clapping or learning new traffic light rules, such as stopping for purple rather than red. Crucially, among the children who played the circle time games, half experienced them as rituals. They were told they must follow the actions of the game because “it has always been done this way” or “those are the rules and they must be followed”. The others experienced the games in a more “instrumental” way that emphasised the purpose of the games. For example, they were told “if we do it this way, we will learn how to dance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the three month period, the children took the tests of executive function and self-control again. The children who’d completed the circle time games showed greater improvements in their executive function and self-control than the control group children, but crucially these gains were larger in the children who experienced the circle time games as ritual. Moreover, the superior improvements in self-control in the ritual group seemed to be explained by their greater increase in executive functioning ability. These effects were similar in Slovakia and Vanuatu even though the latter culture places a greater emphasis on rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far from being a simple matter of ‘mindless’ copying, ritual participation arguably requires the kind of rigorous computation of arbitrary detail and avoidance of normatively proscribed deviation from the script that engages and exercises our executive functioning abilities,” the researchers said. They admitted to the limitations of their study: for one thing, they didn’t measure the children’s behavior during circle time, so it’s not certain the ritual group children really did pay closer attention to the games. Nonetheless, they said there could be educational implications to their results: “the irony may be that in devising strategies for parenting and schooling geared to a world of rapid technological change while neglecting the importance of traditional cultural practices, we may be contributing to a deterioration of young people’s attentive and inhibitive resources, thus promoting impulses toward instant gratification”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color perception is essential for the survival and reproduction of many animals. This study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates the development of a systematic procedure, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, for making color blind Japanese rice fish and testing their spectral sensitivity under light- and dark-adapted conditions. This fish model system can prove useful for studying visual systems and vision-dependent behaviour and can potentially be extended to study color perception in other non-mammalian vertebrates. Finally, it could be valuable for the advancement of genetic or regenerative methods to treat human color blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4081-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing diabetes risk with weight management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight reduction for individuals at high-risk of diabetes is a key measure and policy paradigm for the prevention of the disease. This observational cohort study by Feldman et al., represents a 10-year follow-up in a group of more than 33,000 Swedish  participants between the ages of 30-60. It demonstrates a strong association between the risk of incident diabetes and the relative weight of the participant in adulthood. Additionally, the authors show that as many as 1 in 5 diabetes cases could be prevented if, at a population level, weight in adulthood is maintained. Finally, it concludes that the combination of the former approach together with moderate weight loss for high-risk individuals would have great potential, from a public health perspective, in diabetes prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychiatry: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1173-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSRIs versus placebo in patients with major depressive disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often the first line of treatment for depression. The objective of this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, is to conduct a systematic review assessing the effects of SSRIs versus placebo, ‘active’ placebo, or no intervention in adult participants with major depressive disorder. Meta-analysis data indicate that SSRIs versus placebo seem to have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but according to the authors, the clinical significance of these effects seems questionable and all trials were at high risk of bias. The results show that the harmful effects of SSRIs versus placebo for major depressive disorder seem to outweigh any potentially small beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nematode genus &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; has been integral to our understanding of metazoan biology and has provided key insights into molecular and developmental biology.  In this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt;, Slos et al. use both morphological and molecular analyses to characterise and describe a new species, &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis monodelphis&lt;/em&gt;. Scanning electron micrographs of &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;monodelphis&lt;/em&gt; are utilised to showcase morphological differences between males and females, focusing mainly on genital differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental plasticity, which is considered to have profound macro-evolutionary effects, is omnipresent among plants and animals. This study by van Bergen et al. investigates, using a comparative framework, the evolution of reaction norms for a variety of life history and morphological traits across five related species of mycalesine butterflies from the Old World tropics. It demonstrates that the integrated phenotypic plasticity of a broad suite of traits is shared among species from three geographically independent lineages of mycalesine butterflies, but concurrently, there are examples of evolutionary change where independent traits show different, ‘uncoupled’ patterns of reaction norm evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious Diseases: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2255-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewing the UK management of HIV in pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for HIV transmission between a pregnant woman and her unborn child was first recognised in 1982. The prevention, however, of mother to child transmission (MTCT) is still very complex: interventions aim to reduce risk throughout pregnancy, labour, delivery and the neonatal period. Since 2001, the British HIV Association (BHIVA) has produced guidelines to support clinicians in the delivery of care aimed at reducing MTCT. This audit reviews the UK management of HIV in pregnancy, in comparison with the 2012 BHIVA guidelines. Having investigated more than 1400 pregnancies, the study demonstrates a need for services to review their ability to access urgent HIV testing, to strengthen referral pathways between general and specialist antenatal care services and to identify where delays in starting women on antiretroviral therapy are occurring. Finally, local policy should be kept up to date with national guidance to ensure women are able to access the best possible care available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecology: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0119-y&quot;&gt;Do predator cues affect trait variability in marine dinoflagellates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic plasticity is commonplace and enables organisms to respond to environmental variations. However, the ability of various genotypes to produce a common, environmentally cued phenotype may differ due to genetic variation between individuals .This study, in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;, analysed the plastic response of two genotypes of the marine dinoflagellate &lt;em&gt;Alexandrium fundyense&lt;/em&gt;, in response to grazers or grazer cues, in order to characterise their effect on trait variability. The study demonstrated that selection on different genotypes can occur in the presence of plasticity due to different costs and trade-offs that arise for the respective genotype. The occurrence of multiple environmental cues to respond to in nature might, in fact, equalise the effects of strain-specific trade-offs within populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reaffirmed its focus on publishing research outputs which are useful but often overlooked by traditional research journals such as updates to previous work, additions to established methods, single observations, short null results research proposals and data management plans. To increase clarity and simplicity, we have reduced the number of article types and created ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-note&quot;&gt;Research note&lt;/a&gt;’, the journal’s main article format with a word limit of 2,000 making it a true note article structured as introduction, main text and limitations. Finally, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/introducing-the-new-bmc-research-notes&quot;&gt;expanded the scope&lt;/a&gt; to also welcome submissions on physical and computer sciences, engineering and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: Can neuroscience explain a computer? (by Elena Blanco-Suárez)</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/vx8llsia_q8/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;space invaders brains&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/03/space-invaders-brains-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Elena Blanco-Suárez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common metaphors in neuroscience is that the brain is like a computer. Yet this comparison fails to illustrate how complex our brains are. The brain, like a computer, receives information and analyzes it. However, there are substantial differences in the way a computer or a brain manages information as well as how and from where it receives the inputs, among many other reasons that render the analogy inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Jonas from UC Berkeley and Konrad Kording from Northwestern University in Chicago took this metaphor a step further in an amusing – though slightly disheartening – &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article in PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, alluringly titled &lt;em&gt;Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?&lt;/em&gt; Their intention was to confront the possibility that current neuroscience techniques might not be the best to decipher the workings of the brain. To do this they analyzed a microprocessor as if it were a brain. They collected data using standard neuroscience tools to see whether they could infer the way the machine processes information, just like neuroscientists analyze large datasets to untangle brain mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used three video games, well known to all the 80’s kids reading: Donkey Kong, Space Invaders and Pitfall. Each of these video games represented a different behavioral output from the microprocessor. For the biological equivalent, think of a &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; (the microprocessor) and different behavioral phenotypes (the three video games). Although they acknowledge the limitations of comparing a microprocessor to a living organism’s brain, the authors argue that there are enough similarities to justify the study: both a brain and a microprocessor consist of interconnections of smaller units that can be differentiated and studied individually. They compare the build of the microprocessor to that of a brain, where we find circuits, subdivided into microcircuits, comprised of neurons that make connections through their synapses. Of course, the microprocessor is simpler than a brain in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using neuroscience protocols to study a microprocessor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used established protocols to analyze diverse features of the microprocessor MOS6502, a model that is very well understood. Using the approach presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e04250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of their previous papers&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to identify types of transistors within the microprocessor and the connections between them, similar to the study of connectomics in the brain. In the microprocessor they only found one type of transistor, making it far simpler than a brain. However, it was impossible to infer the operation of the microprocessor by just looking at the connectomics. In neuroscience this is even more complicated, since type of cell, synapses, channels and neurotransmitters have to be integrated into the whole picture. The authors stated the importance of the study of connectomics, but emphasized the lack of algorithms to determine the functions of the brain regions assessed, hence the difficulty of understanding the brain through the sole analysis of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also studied the effect of game performance when they removed one or more transistors from the microprocessor. This is similar to what we do in the lab, when a gene is knocked out to study the effects. They identified the contribution of each transistor to each video game considered, but they could not generalize to the rest of the games without further analysis. According to the authors, these results relate to neuroscience in that it is unlikely that a certain behavior would be triggered without the interaction of different brain circuits/regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the paper, they looked into other aspects of the transistors: tuning, correlations, local field potentials, functional connectivity, spatio-temporal activity, and how they differed depending on the game that was being played. With every set of experiments they concluded that, although interesting and necessary data were drawn, no individual dataset provided a full understanding of how the MOS6502 processes information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better approaches for better conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be taken into account that this study of the microprocessor is a lot cleaner than actual neuroscience. We cannot forget brain plasticity and the capability of the brain to repair circuits or compensate for lesions and other impairments. MOS6502 cannot compensate for what the researchers were doing to it, rendering the data much cleaner and clearer than that from neuroscience experiments &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found their data unsatisfactory&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;as it did not lead to conclusions that accurately explained the function and structure of the microprocessor as they know it. If they had made assumptions about the microprocessor based in the results herein, these might have been erroneous or misleading. This is why they advise caution at interpreting small data sets. The authors insist that better experiments would have helped them to understand the microprocessor. However, what we can learn from this interesting publication is that, although neuroscience is nowadays producing valuable data to understand how our brain is connected, we still fall short of integrating this information at the high level of complexity of the living organism. And per their suggestion, neuroscience might need a better neuroinformatics approach as well as more refined methods for analyzing data to reach reliable and truthful conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, can neuroscientists really understand a microprocessor? Jonas and Kording believe we just need different methods to do so, and that testing these methods in a microprocessor could provide certain validation. But perhaps this study should not be considered as confirmation or rebuttal of the value of neuroscience to understand microprocessors, or even as measurement of the worth of current neuroscientific methods. This study offers additional evidence that brains are not computers. We definitely need a better metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Will my children survive antimicrobial resistance?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Credit: Rocky Mountain Laboratories,NIAID,NIH Color-enhanced scanning electron micrograph showing Salmonella typhimurium (red) invading cultured human cells.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/SalmonellaNIAID-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;As if climate change, international terrorism, rising mental ill-health, teenage knife crime, post-Brexit instability and potential superpower tensions were not enough to worry the heck out of us parents, the real spectre of a post-antibiotic era looms. Will my children live as long as I? Will I live as long as my parents or die a lingering death from an untreatable infection picked up in a nursing home which functioned as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance?  In 2013 England’s Chief Medical Officer considered the rise in antimicrobial resistance “a national civil emergency”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In May 2016, the O’Neill “Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; sponsored by Welcome Trust and the English Department of Health, produced a plan for  tackling drug-resistance globally  exactly one year after the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Health Assembly endorsed the WHO’s global action plan for AMR&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Both plans highlighted “strengthening of knowledge through research”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us with enough miles on our biological clocks, this sounds very familiar. 1998 seemed to be a year signaling a paradigm shift in health priorities with the publication of reports like “The Path of Least Resistance”&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;and the European Union’s urgent convocation of the Copenhagen Summit on &lt;sup&gt;“&lt;/sup&gt;The Microbial Threat”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Both highlighted the need for better research to develop a robust evidence base to inform practice and policy. Twenty years on we appear to stand at the edge of the abyss. Yet it would not be fair to say that in the interim there has been no change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8644&quot; style=&quot;width: 289px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_culture&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8644 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_culture-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Sun14916/Wikipedia Pseudomonas_aeruginosa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;True, much of what we knew then has remained the same. Hands still need to be cleaned, antibiotics prescribed less, narrow spectrum antibiotics preferred, and screening for resistance performed in those patients most likely to suffer severe infection. However we have not advanced much in understanding how to routinely embed these behaviours in clinical practice. Vaccine development has been less promising than hoped. New antibiotic development remains underfunded and unproductive. Despite this, there has been some better research in both the USA and Europe which has included well designed randomized controlled trials&lt;sup&gt;6-8&lt;/sup&gt;. The UK experience  of extra funding for national high-profile political drives  to reduce selected infections through evidence-based policies has been encouraging, with improved hand hygiene&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, less broad-spectrum antibiotic use&lt;sup&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt; and lower infection rates&lt;sup&gt;9-11&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So what has all this got to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?  Well-designed clinical trials and observational studies inform clinicians and policy makers which interventions work, mainly through published research. However, editors of general medical journals are clear that much published research suffers from poor reporting and methodological flaws which could be avoided through adherence to expert consensus-derived reporting guidelines&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. It is against this background that I welcome &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;’ response to an initiative launched by 18 European and American infection control specialists and academics asking infection control journals to endorse those guidelines most relevant to controlling antimicrobial resistance:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consort-statement.org/&quot;&gt;CONSORT&lt;/a&gt; for randomized control trials, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-home&quot;&gt;STROBE&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-singel-news-view&amp;amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1357&amp;amp;cHash=52334cb1c3299d67f6703e13a566035d&quot;&gt;STROME-ID&lt;/a&gt;) for observational epidemiological studies including molecular studies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prisma-statement.org/&quot;&gt;PRISMA&lt;/a&gt; for systematic reviews and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idrn.org/orion.php&quot;&gt;ORION&lt;/a&gt; for infection control intervention studies (especially interrupted time series) and outbreak reports of nosocomial infection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BioMed Central&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#standards+of+reporting&quot;&gt;editorial policies and standards of reporting&lt;/a&gt; endorse CONSORT, STROBE and PRISMA and all guidelines hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR Network&lt;/a&gt;, including ORION. However &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Disease&lt;/em&gt; has now specifically highlighted ORION in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-article&quot;&gt;instructions to authors&lt;/a&gt;. My experience of reporting guidelines is that they and their checklists, not only help me review papers but also help me design and report research, if only to anticipate and avoid adverse comment from potential reviewers or grant assessment panels. Indeed, two or more guidelines may be required to cover all aspects of complicated studies. Most infection control journals have endorsed the above guidelines, although the effect of so doing on raising the quality of published research may depend on the rigor which guideline compliance is enforced, a hypothesis worth testing in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as I enter the last years of my research career, and consider making down-payments on my future nursing home place, I like to think this initiative will result in the high quality research we need being planned and published. If allied to adequate funding of both the research and the clinical implementation of its findings, then maybe my children (and I) might survive antimicrobial resistance.  If climate change and all the rest let us live that long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we’re familiar with the practical implications of increasing population density: traffic jams, longer waits to see a doctor, a lack of available housing. What many of us probably hadn’t realised is how living in crowded environment could be affecting us at a deep psychological level, fostering in us a more future-oriented mindset or what evolutionary psychologists call a “slow life history” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-00749-001/&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Oliver Sng at the University of Michigan and his colleagues present a range of evidence that shows how this strategy plays out in the more patient ways that we approach our relationships, parenting and economic decisions. In essence, the researchers are proposing that the presence of greater numbers of other people in close proximity prompts us to invest in the future as way to compete more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20086&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind life history theory comes from observing variations in behaviour between and across species, mainly in terms of how they approach reproduction. Species with longer life-spans that live in greater population densities tend to favour more investment in fewer offspring who take more time to develop. In contrast, species living in lower densities and at great risk of predators tend to favour a short-term strategy, for example having as many offspring as early as possible in the hope that at least some will survive. There’s also evidence that the same species, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892362/&quot;&gt;such as Chinook salmon&lt;/a&gt;, adjust their mating strategies to the short- or long-term depending on the kind of environment they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test how this might play out with humans, Oliver Sng and his team began by comparing the population densities of countries around the world with a range of parenting and relationship-related outcomes. They found that people in more densely populated countries tend to plan more for the future, have fewer children, have them later, invest in more long-term relationships, and place a greater emphasis on education (this pattern held even after accounting for between-country differences in urbanisation, economic development and population size ). The same pattern also applied across US states: those with greater population density expressed a more future-oriented focus, a “quality over quantity” approach in terms of relationships and child-rearing, and placed more importance on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems with how to interpret this kind of correlational data (for instance, there could be unknown factors involved) so the researchers also conducted some experiments. They found that asking participants to read an apparent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; story about increasing population density in the US led them to favour future financial rewards over more immediate gains in a simple economic game. Listening to the soundtrack of a large human crowd, as opposed to white noise, had a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that the effects of population density reminders seem to be specific to our stage of life. When undergrad students read the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article about America’s increasing crowding, as opposed to an article about rising squirrel populations, they tended to say they favoured investing more in a fewer relationships, but their answers about how many children they wanted, or how much they prioritised education, were unaffected. In contrast, reading about increasing population density led an older group of participants (average age 30) to say they favoured investing more time and effort in having fewer children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sng and his colleagues said their results are preliminary: we need more data to confirm these effects and also to explore the potential mechanisms behind them. They believe many mechanisms are likely at play, including population density affecting our hormones and brain development, our motivations (for example, leading us to realise that we need to increase our chances of competing successfully in future), and cultural norms, for example mores around sex and relationships. “Much remains to be examined,” they concluded. “We hope this initial foray will generate renewed interest in a topic that has been all but forgotten, and encourage the field of research on density to become a little more crowded.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long course of evolution, plants have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, which can be distinguished into two categories: constitutive defenses and inducible defenses. The former ones are physical and chemical barriers existing before insect attack; the latter ones are direct and indirect defenses that are triggered by the insect attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, direct defenses are plant traits able to directly interfere with attacking insects, whereas indirect defenses comprise plant traits that do not affect the susceptibility of host plants by themselves, but can serve as attractants to natural enemies of attacking insects. The response of insects to plant defenses includes the selective choice of different feeding sites, the alteration of the feeding rate or the induction of detoxifying enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long course of evolution, plants have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, which can be distinguished into two categories: constitutive defenses and inducible defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants that accumulate specialized metabolites like the aromatic plant &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica &lt;/em&gt;(the watermint) deter herbivory with a direct defense mechanism, by producing terpenoids in glandular trichomes, which are specialized secretory tissues. Despite the toxic content of such secretory structures, specialized herbivores not only feed on plants bearing these structures, but have also evolved the ability to recognize and be attracted by specific compounds. Therefore, interactions between plants and insects occasionally lead to highly specific relationships, as in the case of &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea &lt;/em&gt;(the mint leaf beetle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The very special relationship between &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea &lt;/em&gt;and the watermint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8614&quot; style=&quot;width: 255px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mint leaf beetles&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8614 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Mint-leaf-beetles-245x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emission of volatile compounds from the glandular trichomes of &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; is mainly characterized by the monoterpene pulegone. This is a potent attractant to &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea, &lt;/em&gt;as shown by olfactometry bioassays. The plant response to &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; herbivory is the activation of genes for terpenoid biosynthesis, diverting most of monoterpene production from pulegone to menthofuran. The latter compound repels &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea &lt;/em&gt;in bioassay tests. Thus, &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea &lt;/em&gt;is attracted by pulegone produced by undamaged &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;, but is deterred by the methofuran production by herbivore-infested &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results indicate a differential tolerance of &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; monoterpenes; however, the detoxifying mechanisms and the catabolic/biotransforming ability that allow the insects to tolerate a high amount of ingested terpenoids remained an open question that has only now found some compelling answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How microorganisms can be involved in plant-insect co-adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is recent evidence that microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract might be involved in biotransformation of ingested leaf volatile terpenoids by activating catabolic and metabolic processes that are absent in insects, hence acting as “microbial brokers”, a strategy that enables phytophagous insects hosting such bacteria to overcome biochemical barriers to herbivory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently described examples are the detoxification of caffeine by gut microbes of the coffee berry borer, and the ability of bark beetles bacterial symbionts to metabolize toxic monoterpenes and diterpene acids produced by the mountain pine beetle in response to herbivore damage. Thus, microbial degradation of plant toxic compounds can occur in insect guts and contribute to the carbon and energy requirements for the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is recent evidence that microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract might be involved in biotransformation of ingested leaf volatile terpenoids by activating catabolic and metabolic processes that are absent in insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, it has been proposed that microbial detoxification may lead to production of pheromonal markers. For instance, some insects feeding on plants that, like &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;, store 1,8-cineole (a monoterpene with mosquito feeding deterrent and ovipositional repellent activities, and toxic effects against stored-grain beetles) show a marked ability to metabolize it into hydroxyl derivatives that several insects might use as pheromones. This hypothesis extends the possible role of the microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract, which could be involved in the biosynthesis of semiochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find in the watermint-mint bug interaction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study we first evaluated the chemical patterns of both &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; leaf and frass (insect faeces) volatiles extracted by &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; males and females feeding on plants. Intriguingly, we observed marked differences between male and female volatiles. The sex-specific chemical pattern of the frass correlated with sex-specific distribution of cultivable gut bacteria. Indeed, all isolated gut bacteria from females belonged to either α- or γ-Proteobacteria, whilst those from males were γ-Proteobacteria or Firmicutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments we then demonstrated that the microbial communities from the two sexes were associated to specific metabolic patterns with respect to their ability to biotransform and/or detoxify &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; terpenoids (including methofuran, menthone, 1,8-cineole, limonene and pulegone), and metabolize them into an array of compounds with possible pheromone activity. Thus, the gut bacteria of the mint leaf beetle influence the volatile blend of herbivory-induced &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; volatiles in a sex-specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that our study may contribute to our current understanding about the plant-insect chemical communication, providing a new perspective on exploitation of bacteria living in insect gut as producers of semiochemicals for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The birth prevalence of mitochondrial disease is approximately 1 in 5000, however 1 in 500 carry mutations in their mitochondrial genome. As there is no cure for mitochondrial disease, the immense variability in genetic defects and disease severity has made effective disease management challenging. Therefore prevention of genetic disease transmission from mother to a child using mitochondrial replacement therapy holds significant promise. Mitochondrial replacement therapy involves combining the nuclear DNA from the mother with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. This technique was originally developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/102/46/16765.full&quot;&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, validated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7262/full/nature08368.html&quot;&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt;, and recently the birth of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2107219-exclusive-worlds-first-baby-born-with-new-3-parent-technique/&quot;&gt;first ‘three person’ baby&lt;/a&gt; was reported in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, evolutionary biologists have raised concerns about the safety of mitochondrial replacement which are largely centered on the idea that nuclear and mitochondrial genomes evolved concurrently, and therefore mitochondria from one individual or population may not be compatible with nuclear material from another. Indeed as human populations have migrated and become distinct, as have the distribution of mitochondrial &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;gene groups inherited from the mother (mitochondrial &lt;/span&gt;haplotypes). This is illustrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;figure from the article&lt;/a&gt; (below), which shows the global distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and highlights the immense variability and how different populations are dominated by distinct regional haplotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8626&quot; style=&quot;width: 979px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adapted from Rishishwar and Jordan 2017: Map indicating the names and locations of the 1000 genome populations studied, together with pie charts showing the relative frequencies of distinct mtDNA haplogroups for each population. &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8626&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/mtnDNA-blog-image.gif&quot; width=&quot;969&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2A from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;Rishishwar and Jordan 2017&lt;/a&gt;: Map indicating the names and locations of the 1000 genome populations studied, together with pie charts showing the relative frequencies of distinct mtDNA haplogroups for each population.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious implications of incompatibility and nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch have been indicated by studies in model organism such as mice and invertebrates. For example, although mice with mismatched mitochondrial and nuclear genomes survived into adulthood they showed reduced physical performance, learning and growth. However, as these animals are generated by repeated inbreeding, divergent mitochondria are introduced into highly inbreed lines, and therefore these model organism studies do not reflect the human condition where breeding between populations is common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;therefore aimed to gain an idea of the extent of nuclear-mitochondrial divergence that can be tolerated in a single individual and gain an idea of how often ‘swapping’ has occurred in human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalgenome.org/&quot;&gt;1000 Genomes Project&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cephb.fr/hgdp/&quot;&gt;Human Genome Diversity Project,&lt;/a&gt; the researchers were able to observe and quantify the extent of naturally occurring nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch seen in 3,547 healthy individuals across over 58 populations on 5 continents. As human genomic diversity has been shaped by natural selection, harmful combinations of nuclear-mitochondrial genomes should have been eliminated and therefore not observed in the existing healthy population sampled in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis showed that generally the genetic distance between nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mtDNA sequences, which is reflective of evolutionary relationships and migration, were highly correlated. This is what would be expected based on their co-evolution in different human populations. However, analysis also showed that even individuals with very similar nDNA genomes can have highly divergent mtDNA. For example, in Puerto Rico 67% of the sampled population have mtDNA of Native American origin and 13% carry mtDNA haplotypes of European origin. In contrast, analysis of nDNA in the same population showed the reverse with 72% European ancestry and only 13% Native American ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrated that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from divergent populations can coexist in healthy individuals, indicating that mismatched nDNA/mtDNA combinations are not deleterious or subjected to purifying selection. This holds great significance for the future prospects of this technique as it suggests nuclear-mitochondrial mismatches are not likely to jeopardize the or safety of mitochondrial replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention Joachim Boldt: The 1990s are calling, and they want their papers back. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery has retracted two papers from the early 1990s on which Boldt was the first author – bringing the retraction tally for the disgraced German anesthesiologist to 96, by our count. Both articles were found to contain manipulated […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Free the journals</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/free-the-journals/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These days, academic journals serve two purposes: to organize peer review, and to make an editorial selection. With internet and in particular “preprint” servers (eg &lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;biorxiv&lt;/a&gt;), journals are no longer necessary for distributing academic papers. It is also worth reminding that the peer review system has not always been organized in the way it is currently organized, ie with several external reviewers, multiple revision rounds, etc. For example, Nature only introduced formal peer review in 1967. Before that, the selection would be done internally by the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two missions, organizing peer review and making an editorial selection, are currently coupled. But this is neither necessary, nor a good thing. It is obvious that this coupling is not necessary. One could easily imagine a system where papers are submitted to a mega-journal (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/&quot;&gt;PeerJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1000research.com/&quot;&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/a&gt;), which organizes the peer review, and then journals (e.g. Nature or Cell) make their editorial selection based on perceived “impact”, possibly using the reviews. Instead, authors must submit to each journal separately until their paper is accepted, and reviewers are asked both to check the scientific standards, which is the alleged purpose of peer review, and to judge the perceived importance of papers, which is an editorial task. This results in frustration for the authors, unnecessary delays and tremendous waste of resources. Thus, it is not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a peer review system is organized (eg by mega-journals), the remaining role of journals is then editorial selection, and this could be done separately. Once we realize that, it becomes clear that very little infrastructure should be needed to run a journal. A journal issue is then just a list of papers selected by an editor, put online with the appropriate links and editorial comments. I propose that every scientist, or lab, or possibly group of interest, starts their own journal, which I will call “&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/about-this-free-journal/&quot;&gt;free journal&lt;/a&gt;” (see my related posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-vision-of-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/my-new-year-resolution-to-help-move-science-to-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;). Free journals are not tied to any commercial interest; they are self-managed academic journals. Crucially, the editor makes a personal selection based on her readings, papers that she personally thinks are interesting. This means in particular that, in contrast with most journals, the editor is highly qualified. The selection is meaningful, not a collection of thumbs up/down made by disparate reviewers based on vague criteria (“impact”). It also implies that it is totally acceptable for the editorial selection to include “preprints”: the editor is a peer and therefore any featured paper is by definition peer reviewed (ie, as in Nature before 1967). I have made my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;free journal of theoretical neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in this spirit. I have collected &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/how-to-make-a-free-journal/&quot;&gt;some technical advice &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/how-to-make-a-free-journal/&quot;&gt;on how to make one&lt;/a&gt;, and I would be happy to receive any suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottomline is: it is very easy to make a free journal. On the technical side, one essentially needs to use a blogging system, eg WordPress. This automatically generates an RSS feed (eg one post per issue). I also put all the comments associated to the selected papers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, with a link to the journal; this way, anyone using their plugin automatically sees that the papers have been selected in the journal when looking at them on pubmed, for example. On the editorial side, it actually represents little work, and I believe that this little amount is actually quite interesting work to do. Every scientist reads and annotates papers. All that is required to run a free journal then, is to set half a day in the month to put your notes together into a post. This helps organizing your bibliographical notes, and it is helpful for your colleagues and your students. One could also imagine coupling this writing with the lab’s journal club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave me a note if you are making your own free journal and I would be happy to link it from my journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My free journal: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;Brette’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;free journal of theoretical neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/03/01/bmc-ecology-image-competition-announcement-2017/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;2016's overall winner by Davide Gaglio, the striking landscape of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park during sunrise.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/08/SA-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that the 5th annual &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; image competition launches today! We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science. The four previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/aug/09/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2016-the-winners-in-pictures&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/&quot;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151&quot;&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging the competition will be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; Section Editors&lt;/a&gt;, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5510&quot; style=&quot;width: 2010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The overall winner from 2014, “A Namaqua rock mouse (Aethomys namaquensis, Muridae) getting dusted with pollen of the Pagoda Lily (Whiteheadia bifolia, Hyacinthaceae) while lapping nectar at the flowers.” &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5510&quot; height=&quot;1446&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/08/Overall-winner-Sticky-snack-for-mice-by-Petra-Wester-compressed2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The overall winner from 2014, by Petra Wester, “A Namaqua rock mouse (&lt;em&gt;Aethomys namaquensis&lt;/em&gt;) getting dusted with pollen of the Pagoda Lily (&lt;em&gt;Whiteheadia bifolia&lt;/em&gt;) while lapping nectar at the flowers.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is affiliated with a research institution can enter.  We ask that entries be submitted to one of the five categories listed below &lt;strong&gt;and that they depict a specific ecological interaction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behavioral and physiological ecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservation ecology and biodiversity research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community, population, and macroecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the research literature on self-serving biases, it’s little surprise that critical thinking – much needed in today’s world – is such a challenge. Consider three human biases that you may already have heard of: most of us think we’re better than average at most things (also known as illusory superiority or the Lake Wobegon Effect); we’re also prone to “confirmation bias”, which is favouring evidence that supports our existing views; and we’re also susceptible to the “endowment effect” which describes the extra value we place on things, just as soon as they are ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470218.2015.1099162&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; by Aiden Gregg and his colleagues at the University of Southampton extends the list of known biases by documenting a new one that combines elements of the better-than-average effect, confirmation bias and the endowment effect. Gregg’s team have shown that simply asking participants to imagine that a theory is their own biases them to believe in the truth of that theory – a phenomenon that the researchers have called the Spontaneous Preference For Own Theories (SPOT) Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19958&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three studies, the researchers asked hundreds of participants to imagine a fictional planet in a distant solar system, inhabited by various creatures some of which are predators and others prey. Focusing on two of the creatures on the planet – Niffites and Luppites – the participants were either told to imagine that they (that is, the participant himself or herself) had a theory that the Niffites were the predators and the Luppites were their prey, or that somebody called Alex had this theory. This background scenarios was chosen to be neutral and unconnected to existing beliefs, and the hypothetical “ownership” of the theory by some of the participants was intended to be as superficial and inconsequential as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers presented the participants with a series of seven facts relevant to the theory. The first few were mildly supportive of the theory (e.g. Niffites are bigger), but the last few provided strong evidence against (e.g. Luppites have been observed eating the dead bodies of Niffites). After each piece of evidence, the participants were asked to rate how likely it was that the theory was true or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the participants interpreted the theory in the light of the evidence was influenced by the simple fact of whether they’d been asked to imagine the theory was theirs or someone else’s. When it was their own theory, they more stubbornly persisted in believing in its truth, even in the face of increasing counter-evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spontaneous bias toward one’s own theory was found across the studies: when different names were used for the creatures (Dassites and Fommites); whether testing happened online or in groups in a lecture room; regardless of age and gender; and also when an additional control condition stated that the theory was no one’s in particular, as opposed to being Alex’s. The last detail helps clarify that the bias is in favour of one’s own theory rather than against someone else’s. Surprisingly perhaps, the bias wasn’t found to be stronger in participants who scored higher for other forms of self-serving bias such as narcissism or claiming to be familiar with non-existent words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistical terms, the size of the bias that participants showed toward their “own” theory was modest, meaning that the practical implications of these new findings are probably limited (though the basic principle – that we’re biased towards our own theories – certainly seems relevant to understanding the wrangles over facts and truth going on in the media these days). Gregg and his colleagues said that the more important point was the theoretical implications of their results. The fact it was so easy to induce this bias in the participants, even based on such minimal personal connection to the theory, “only underlines how exquisitely sensitive to self-enhancing biases the human mind actually is,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/03/01/self-injury-breaking-myths/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;iStock&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/iStock_000041687012_XXXLarge-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behaviors of a group of individuals that rarely reflect reality. There are many negative stereotypes associated with mental health, most of which can be attributed to a lack of understanding; these stereotypes have led to strong social stigma attached to mental ill health, which often has a negative effect on the lives of people with mental health problems. In particular, there are lots of negative stereotypes and myths attached to self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Self-injury isn’t common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact numbers of how many people self-harm in the general population is hard to determine. Available research likely misrepresents how common self-harm is; published studies are usually based on people who either seek help at a hospital, or from their primary healthcare provider, after harming themselves (so called clinical samples). However, a lot of people who self-harm do not seek help; meaning that these clinical samples are not representative of self-injury rates in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published rates of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) vary hugely between studies; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422986&quot;&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that many of the differences in prevalence rates reported in non-clinical samples are likely due to different definitions of self-harm behaviors and different methods of assessment between studies. After adjustment for methodological factors, the researchers calculated the pooled lifetime prevalence of NSSI to be 17.2% among adolescents, 13.4% among young adults, and 5.5% among adults. As these figures show, people of all ages self-injure – it is not just a teenage thing – but there is far less data available about the rates of self-injury in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Only women self-harm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that women and girls are more likely to engage in self-harm, however the evidence in the published literature is conflicting, depending on the country, age range and type of sample (e.g. clinical, college, community) studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25795294&quot;&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which included 120 studies that contain demographically diverse samples, suggests that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25795294&quot;&gt;women are slightly more likely than men to engage in NSSI&lt;/a&gt;”, but the overall rate of NSSI identified among males (26.36%) was still remarkably high. They also found that “the gender difference was larger in clinical samples compared to both community and college samples”, suggesting that males who engage in NSSI may be less likely to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: People who self-harm are suicidal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is sometimes viewed as a suicide attempt by people who don’t understand it. By its very definition the term NSSI describes the intentional destruction of one’s own body tissue without suicidal intent, and for purposes not socially sanctioned. For the majority of people who self-harm it is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014942&quot;&gt;emotion regulation strategy&lt;/a&gt; – it’s about trying to cope with difficult feelings and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is a relationship between self-harm and suicide – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617686&quot;&gt;those who self-harm are at greater risk than the general population&lt;/a&gt; – many more people self-harm than commit suicide. However, some people who self-harm also have suicidal feelings and might attempt to take their own life, which is why self-harm must always be taken seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a procedure that tries to shape a participant's pattern of brain  activity by providing real-time feedback, often in the form of a video game combined with other sensory stimuli that provide rewards when the “correct” state is achieved. The most common form of NFT uses EEG (brainwave) activity recorded non-invasively from the scalp. The EEG is a complex mixture&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cytosolic proteostasis through importing of misfolded proteins into mitochondria</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Dtoqx7x6sWg/nature21695</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Loss of proteostasis underlies ageing and neurodegeneration characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although many neurodegenerative-disease-associated proteins can be found in mitochondria, it remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation could be related. In dividing yeast cells, protein aggregates that form under stress or during ageing are preferentially retained by the mother cell, in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps to dissociate aggregates and thereby enables refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. Here we show that, in yeast, cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates that form under heat shock contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with the mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after heat shock, and some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires the mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC (mitochondria as guardian in cytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21695&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21695&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Dtoqx7x6sWg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Transcription control by the ENL YEATS domain in acute leukaemia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/plYRmv6ctR4/nature21688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give rise to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical outcome. The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: ENL links histone acetylation to oncogenic gene expression in acute myeloid leukaemia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/A_Qka2M8dZo/nature21687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. Recognition of modified histones by ‘reader’ proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR–Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The conserved Mediator co-activator complex has an essential role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription in all eukaryotes. Understanding the structure and interactions of Mediator is crucial for determining how the complex influences transcription initiation and conveys regulatory information to the basal transcription machinery. Here we present a 4.4 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mediator in which conserved Mediator subunits are individually resolved. The essential Med14 subunit works as a central backbone that connects the Mediator head, middle and tail modules. Comparison with a 7.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of a Mediator–RNA polymerase II holoenzyme reveals that changes in the structure of Med14 facilitate a large-scale Mediator rearrangement that is essential for holoenzyme formation. Our study suggests that access to different conformations and crosstalk between structural elements are essential for the Mediator regulation mechanism, and could explain the capacity of the complex to integrate multiple regulatory signals.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Autophagy maintains the metabolism and function of young and old stem cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1_OFz3wwKiY/nature21388</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 With age, haematopoietic stem cells lose their ability to regenerate the blood system, and promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and longevity, and is critical for protecting haematopoietic stem cells from metabolic stress. Here we show that loss of autophagy in haematopoietic stem cells causes accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which drives accelerated myeloid differentiation mainly through epigenetic deregulations, and impairs haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal activity and regenerative potential. Strikingly, most haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice share these altered metabolic and functional features. However, approximately one-third of aged haematopoietic stem cells exhibit high autophagy levels and maintain a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential similar to healthy young haematopoietic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that autophagy actively suppresses haematopoietic stem-cell metabolism by clearing active, healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes increasingly necessary with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old haematopoietic stem cells.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The molecular architecture of lamins in somatic cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/lIg6gsSugOE/nature21382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The nuclear lamina is a fundamental constituent of metazoan nuclei. It is composed mainly of lamins, which are intermediate filament proteins that assemble into a filamentous meshwork, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin. Besides providing structural stability to the nucleus, the lamina is involved in many nuclear activities, including chromatin organization, transcription and replication. However, the structural organization of the nuclear lamina is poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron tomography to obtain a detailed view of the organization of the lamin meshwork within the lamina. Data analysis of individual lamin filaments resolves a globular-decorated fibre appearance and shows that A- and B-type lamins assemble into tetrameric filaments of 3.5 nm thickness. Thus, lamins exhibit a structure that is remarkably different from the other canonical cytoskeletal elements. Our findings define the architecture of the nuclear lamin meshworks at molecular resolution, providing insights into their role in scaffolding the nuclear lamina.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Although it is not known when or where life on Earth began, some of the earliest habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3,770 million and possibly 4,280 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown among carbonate rosettes and magnetite–haematite granules, and is associated with carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3,770 million years ago.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are largely heterogeneous and functionally uncharacterized. Here, using FANTOM5 cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data, we integrate multiple transcript collections to generate a comprehensive atlas of 27,919 human lncRNA genes with high-confidence 5′ ends and expression profiles across 1,829 samples from the major human primary cell types and tissues. Genomic and epigenomic classification of these lncRNAs reveals that most intergenic lncRNAs originate from enhancers rather than from promoters. Incorporating genetic and expression data, we show that lncRNAs overlapping trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are specifically expressed in cell types relevant to the traits, implicating these lncRNAs in multiple diseases. We further demonstrate that lncRNAs overlapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms of messenger RNAs are co-expressed with the corresponding messenger RNAs, suggesting their potential roles in transcriptional regulation. Combining these findings with conservation data, we identify 19,175 potentially functional lncRNAs in the human genome.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Edit (28 February 2017): Earlier today, it was &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/&quot;&gt;announced that Mozilla had acquired Pocket&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzil.la/1343006&quot;&gt;plans to gradually release the Pocket source code under Open Source licenses&lt;/a&gt;.  I guess &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wallabag.org/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/a&gt; will remain as a self hosted solution, but given an improved integration of Pocket with Firefox, I may move back to it in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always have quite a bit on my pending list to read - academic papers, blogs, planets, and the sort. Usually, when I go through the planets, such as the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://fedoraplanet.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://planet.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; or the two neuroscience planets I use - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;, I don't have the time to read all the articles right then. I used to either bookmark links, or note them down somewhere to read later. One day, though, I ran into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you save the article to read later and makes it available to you on multiple devices. It's extremely convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the one issue with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; is that it isn't &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;Free software&lt;/a&gt;. So, like I do, I went looking for an alternative. After a few hours, I ran into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wallabag.org/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.

It's quite easy to deploy, and there's a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag&quot;&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; where you can get some help too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You either enter the URL in the Wallabag page manually, or you can use the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wallabagger/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallabagger/gbmgphmejlcoihgedabhgjdkcahacjlj&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/wallabagger/?display=en&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; addon - it let's you right click a page or a link and &quot;Wallabag.it!&quot;.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallabag fetches the text of the page and stores it for you so that you can read it later. You can even organise your saved pages with tags and the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the Wallabag main page&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive align-center&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a page that I'm trying to read later, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot showing an article in Wallabag&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive align-center&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played with a deployment, but decided not to deploy and maintain an instance myself. Instead, I signed up for the instance Wallabag have here - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wallabag.it/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag.it&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite cheap - they have an offer going too at the moment - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wallabag.org/en/news/wallabagit&quot;&gt;only 9€ for an entire year&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallabag uses a the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://fivefilters.org/content-only/&quot;&gt;FiveFilters Full Text RSS tool&lt;/a&gt; to extract the text and other data from web pages. Some websites require special instructions to tell the tool what information needs to be extracted - this tends to happen with a few academic websites. There's a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config&quot;&gt;repository of such config files here&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you do run into a website that isn't rendering properly, you can &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/errors_during_fetching.html&quot;&gt;troubleshoot the issue and submit a config file too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to deploy an instance yourself, or use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wallabag.it/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag.it&lt;/a&gt;, I think it's a really useful tool to have. Of course, don't forget to install the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;app on your phone&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Women are still underrepresented in managerial positions, particularly at the top of organisations. It’s not just that women are unable to attain these positions due to discrimination or access to resources. There’s also evidence that suggests these positions may be less attractive to women, as having a senior job tends to increase life satisfaction for men &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-009-9560-4&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;but not for women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; this could lead to women exiting such career paths or shying away from them even if well qualified. &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9832-z&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Happiness Studies&lt;/em&gt; asks a simple, but important question: why are women managers less happy than their male counterparts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19922&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilke Brockmann and her colleagues drew on a large German survey conducted between 1984-2011 involving data from 27,000 non-managers and 3174 managers, a third of whom were women. The survey featured questions about life satisfaction, pay and spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, female managers reported slightly lower life satisfaction than their male counterparts, consistent with past research. They also seemed to find higher pay less rewarding than men. Based on correlations between life satisfaction and pay across male and female managers, on the researchers’ estimate it would take an extra €12,000 of pay to boost a woman’s life satisfaction by the same amount that a man would gain from an extra €5,000 of pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with previous evidence that suggests men value money particularly highly against other benefits like more free time. Also, highly educated ambitious women are likely to settle down with romantic partners who are in similar careers and – especially if their partner is male – who may earn more than them. This means female managers can be in a situation where further gains in their own income matter less, given their net household worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brockmann and her colleagues expected and found that spare time would have a stronger association with happiness for women managers than men. One reason for this is women tend to have less free time than men, as they often take on greater responsibility for caring duties within a household. As managerial promotions often involve sacrificing free time for money, this deal is going to be less attractive for many women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Brockmann’s team found that caring less about money and more about time was at the heart of female managers’ dissatisfaction. Their analysis showed that if it were not for those factors, women would be &lt;em&gt;happier&lt;/em&gt; in managerial roles than men, which suggests that the nature of managerial work is not a problem for women, but how it is structured and compensated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the issue of whether female managers are more adversely affected than male managers by the decision to delay having children in pursuit of their careers. They found some evidence to support this, in that between the ages of 35 and 45 (when fertility tends to decline in women) childless female managers felt significantly less satisfied with their lives than female managers who’d had children and male managers who were childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brockmann and her colleagues pointed out that the lack of gender parity at senior management levels isn’t solved by simply bringing women into the boardroom, as this may just consign them to an unhappy stay. A major problem is that in most working cultures leadership positions “require a non-stop lifelong commitment to extra-long working hours and early career path-dependencies” which may repel women who particularly value their free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution for companies who want to attract more female managers would be to build in more breathing space for their leadership positions – after all, successful entrepreneurs can &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/im-jason-fried-ceo-of-basecamp-and-this-is-how-i-work-1790556608&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;build businesses on 40 hours a week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – and to provide other “temporal rewards” like flexible career paths, especially to help younger women more easily juggle family and work ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

In less than 10 years, Rare Disease Day (and #RareDiseaseDay) has grown from a centralized effort to bring attention to these disorders by patient organizations in Europe to an international awareness and action day that includes patients, legislators, research funders, scientists and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 350 million people worldwide suffer from rare diseases, defined regionally according to prevalence. In the European Union a rare disease is one that affects less than 1 in 2,000 patients while in the United Kingdom the qualification is less than 50,000 patients and in the United States the classification is less than 200,000 patients. Regardless, rare diseases usually have a genetic basis and are frequently progressive, disabling and with time, life-threatening. There are currently more than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://globalgenes.org/rare-diseases-facts-statistics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7,000 different types of rare diseases and disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the rare disease patient advocacy organization Global Genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested in general concepts related to rare disease and treatments or drug development can look to recent PLOS articles covering “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170365&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clinical Practice Guidelines for Rare Diseases: The Orphanet Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164681&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Profitability and Market Value of Orphan Drug Companies: A Retrospective, Propensity-Matched Case-Control Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” and “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Access to Orphan Drugs: A Comprehensive Review of Legislations, Regulations and Policies in 35 Countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rarediseaseday.org/page/news/2017-theme-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theme of Rare Disease Day 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with the slogan “&lt;strong&gt;With research, possibilities are limitless.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in PLOS journals is a testament to the dedication of scientists working on these diseases that often have less funding and attention than other biomedical issues, and the willingness of these scientists to go beyond publishing Open Access to make their data available for the rare disease community is critical to accelerate a path forward to uncover treatments and cures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, one of this year’s finalists for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openscienceprize.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Science Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, given for unique insights developed from shared data, is described in this video “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWM1bn9e4KU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyGene2: Accelerating Gene Discovery with Radically Open Data Sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.” Researchers at the University of Washington created the web portal MyGene2 as a place for people with rare genetic mutations to connect with others that share the condition and with researchers interested in their particular mutation. Michael Bamshad, PLOS author and professor and chief of the Division of Genetic Medicine in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington &amp;amp; Seattle Children’s Hospital, describes this Open Science resource in a RARECast podcast interview, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/rarecast/helping-patients-with-the-same-undiagnosed-genetic-condition-find-each-other&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Helping Patients with the Same Undiagnosed Genetic Condition Find Each Other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.” Research from Bamshad’s group also includes &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; articles on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065834&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implications of fine-scale patterns of population ancestry on rare variant genome-wide association studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024745&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genetic variation and risk for symptomatic West Nile Virus infection and disease progression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt; article discussing &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005963&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mutations and a rare-disease inheritance model applied to congenital heart disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to data sharing, opportunities to improve diagnoses stem from genetic sequencing advances, as described in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006081&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improving the identification of cancer-associated genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146040&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co-occurrence of rare diseases and resolution of a complex phenotype by next-gen sequencing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare Disease Day is a chance to draw attention to the research and policies needed to advance understanding of these disorders that challenge the lives of so many. This year’s theme, “with research, possibilities are limitless” meshes well with the community PLOS serves as a science, technology and medicine Open Access publisher. A small sample of new research on rare diseases from PLOS authors is highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Why requesters love Sourcing Manager &amp; neuroscientist, Zev Wisotsky</title>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/02/meet_zev/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At Science Exchange, our Masters’ and Ph.D.-level sourcing managers will help you find the right service provider for your project. Based on glowing customer testimonials, we know that our sourcing managers are one of our company’s greatest assets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Let’s get to know them better! We’ll start with customers’ favorite, Zev Wisotsky. Trained in neuroscience, he devoted his graduate research to studying taste detection in insects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zev&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1033 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Zev-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We love working with you, you are amazing…Thanks for everything you do.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;— &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researcher at Gilead Sciences, to Zev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured Sourcing Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; Zev Wisotsky, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expertise: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why requesters keep coming back to him: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Zev embodies excellence in customer service. That rare combination of empathy, patience, dedication, and hyper-organization comes together in Zev, seasoned with a dash of effortless communication and a sauce of good humor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One request he is proud of being able to source: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Zev is particularly proud to have once located some difficult-to-find tuberculosis blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for a client that was not able to find them. This allowed our client to further their research. They were also excited to be able to start their project quickly once they joined Science Exchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How he solved one tough sourcing challenge: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There was one overseas shipping error where Zev was able to coordinate with the client and service provider to fix and reship samples with minimal extraneous costs and time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience (education and/or prior roles): &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Zev graduated from University of California Riverside with a degree in Neuroscience, investigating and characterizing the cellular mechanisms involved in taste detection using fruit fly and mosquito. He then completed postdoctoral research at Stanford investigating the role of brain regions involved in fear memory and addiction through silencing different brain circuits optogenetically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Likes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bicycling, singing and playing music&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dislikes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Traffic and stale cake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So…. do flies like beer or water? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The answer is in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2011/11/25/142708527/beer-or-water-for-flies-that-s-an-easy-choice&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NPR article about Zev’s research!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Eating disorders: the importance of early intervention</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/27/eating-disorders-importance-early-intervention/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Courtney Emery, Flickr CC&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/5523425885_0900138aae_b-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with a complex and largely unknown etiology. EDs encompass a variety of disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starving, intense fear of gaining weight and disturbance in self perceived weight or shape. Patients with bulimia nervosa suffer from recurrent binge-eating episodes (the consumption of abnormally large amounts of food in a relatively short period of time) with a sense of loss of control, followed by feelings of guilt and shame, which leads the person to compensatory behaviors (self-induced vomiting, over-exercising, use of laxatives or diuretics). These patients usually maintain normal weight, unlike anorexic ones. Binge eating disorder is characterized by eating excessive amounts of food, often when not hungry, without the compensatory behaviors of bulimia nervosa. As a result, patients are often overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8608&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;BEAT - https://www.b-eat.co.uk/&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8608&quot; height=&quot;94&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/EDAW_17_original-small-300x94.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.b-eat.co.uk/&quot;&gt;beat – beating eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aetiology of these disorders appears to be multifactorial: genetic, biological, socio-cultural, and psychological factors can contribute to their development and maintenance. The course of EDs is often relapsing and in a substantial proportion of cases protracted with a treatment-resistant disorder sometimes occurring. EDs are severe illnesses for a number of reasons: mortality is high, risk of suicidality is high, quality of life is poor, short- and long-term organic consequences strongly impact patients’ lives, and psychiatric comorbidity (mostly depression, anxiety, and personality disorders) is endemic to sufferers. As a result, EDs tend to appear as a treatment conundrum; although research is proposing interesting novel treatment approaches with encouraging results. Treatments are challenging mostly for anorexia nervosa: no current medications are able to reverse the core symptoms which exist, and long and costly hospitalizations are frequently needed. Duration of illness is a relevant factor in treatment response; adolescents with anorexia nervosa seem to benefit more from outpatient treatments than adults do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, it is key to recognize ED symptoms as soon as possible because an early intervention could be crucial with respect to treatment response and outcome. If EDs are caught in time, treatments can be decisive to change their course and to reduce the risk of stigma, complications, and death. Primary prevention is fundamental, potentially involving families, teachers and personal trainers, to name just a few. Know what to look for – Weight loss, refusal to eat certain foods, anxiety about gaining weight or being “fat”, excessive and rigid exercise regimens are fundamental first signs of an eating disorder that can be recognized early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An impressive amount of research has linked frequency of sex with greater happiness. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550615616462&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; even put a monetary estimate on it. They said that the happiness spurt from having sex once a week compared with monthly is similar to the boost you’d get from earning an extra $50,000 a year (though for anything more frequent than weekly sex, the benefits seemed to tail off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking if and why more sex makes us happier may sound like asking the blindingly obvious, but of course a lot of pleasurable activities don’t have long-term emotional benefits; it’s also tricky to rule out the simple alternative possibility that we’re more likely to have sex if we’re happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216684124&quot;&gt;series of studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, psychologists in Switzerland and Canada have looked beyond the immediate bliss that sex can bring, and they say that the main reason that more sex seems to contribute to greater long-term happiness is because of all the cuddling (and other expressions of affection) that’s involved, both at the time, and for hours afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Talking It Over&lt;/em&gt;, Julian Barnes writes that “Love is just a system for getting someone to call you darling after sex”; this new research suggests that sex is a system for getting someone you love to call you darling, and to give you a big cuddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19792&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anik Debrot at the University of Fribourg and her colleagues conducted two surveys, the first involving 335 participants, recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk site, who were in a romantic relationship, and the second involving both partners in 74 couples recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The vast majority of participants were heterosexual. They answered questions about how often they had sex, about how much affectionate touch went on in their relationship (e.g. cuddling, hugging, kissing and caressing) and rated their life satisfaction or how much they typically experienced positive emotions like joy and contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having more sex was correlated with greater life satisfaction and experiencing more positive emotions, consistent with past research. But when the researchers factored amount of affection into the equation, the sex–happiness link all but disappeared (with one exception – to the researchers’ surprise they found this wasn’t true for women in the second survey). The overall implication of the surveys was that more sex leads to more happiness because it promotes affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also conducted two “experience-sampling” studies.  The first involved 106 couples, most of them married, with children. Each participant kept a diary for ten days, noting their sexual activity, including any erotic moments; their affectionate experiences, including “moments of love and security” and “affectionate or thoughtful signs from my partner”; and their emotions. They kept these records in the morning before work; after work; during the 45 minutes after reunion with their partner; and during the last hour before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the earlier surveys, this showed that sex in the preceding 24 hours was associated with feeling more positive emotions in the morning, but that this correlation was greatly reduced once affection in the preceding 24 hours was taken into account. In other words, sex seemed to lead to positive emotions because sex tended to go hand with love and cuddles. Indeed, sex without affection was extremely rare (this only happened on 4.2 per cent of occasions according to the diaries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also caught up with these couples six months later. More sex during the diary part of the study foretold greater relationship satisfaction all these months later, but only when that earlier sex had been associated with the experience of positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A methodological challenge for this topic is that it’s not easy to conduct a controlled experiment in which you instruct participants how much sex or cuddling to get involved in and then look at the effects on their well-being (even if you tried such a study, it wouldn’t exactly be comparable to real-life). To try to get round this, the researchers looked to see whether sex at one time point was associated with more affection later on, which would help support their ideas about how sex promotes affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, the final study involved 58 heterosexual couples keeping notes on their sexual activity and affection (defined here as “moments of love and affection”) via a smartphone several times a day for two weeks: at waking, at midday, at 6pm and before going to bed. This showed that when participants reported having sex at one time point, they were more likely to report experiencing affection not just at that time, but also at the next data entry hours later. This still doesn’t prove sex causes affection and that affection causes the happiness that’s previously been linked with sex, but it’s consistent with that interpretation of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debrot and her team said their studies represented a rare attempt to bridge the typically separate fields of sex research and relationship research. “When engaging in sex, people not only seek an intimate connection, but indeed experience more affection, both when having sex and in the next several hours,” they said. “Hence sex seems not only beneficial because of its physiological or hedonic effects, but because it promotes a stronger and more positive connection with the partner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that their findings could help some couples – for example, at times when sex isn’t possible for whatever reason, the results suggest that making the effort to be affectionate could be beneficial for wellbeing and the relationship. Conversely, the researchers said, “sexual activity might compensate for the diminished well-being in partners having difficulties adequately exchanging affection.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: So you want to be a physician blogger? Perspectives of a neonatal blogger on the use of social media by physicians</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/27/want-physician-blogger-perspectives-neonatal-blogger-use-social-media-physicians/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;office-594132_960_720&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/office-594132_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Neonatologist who also writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnipegneonatal.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my own blog&lt;/a&gt;, I read with interest the following article published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making&lt;/em&gt; in 2016: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-016-0327-y&quot;&gt;Social media use by physicians: a qualitative study of the new frontier of medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study interviewed 17 physician users of social media, but lacked the perspective of a physician blogger. I identified with the study’s themes of Rugged Individualism, Uncertainty, Social Media as Media, and Time Constraints. We in the medical social media world are certainly learning as we go. Without clear paths drawn for us, we explore and contemplate how we will make a positive difference far beyond the reach of the typical physician in a clinic, hospital, or local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to add my perspective as a Neonatologist to the findings of the above study, share what drove me to enter this space in medicine, and discuss what I have learned about increasing my sphere of influence in social media circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing the combined power of multiple social media sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you begin blogging you soon realise that the method has its limitations in terms of reach. As the above paper suggests, polling of social media users identifies multiple potential websites for both collecting and disseminating information (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Linkedin, Google+ as examples).  Using them in combination can far enhance your reach. At the time of this writing the number of people who “follow” me on each site is quite disparate with Facebook by far leading the way in distribution power:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Followers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;13592&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;1006&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;WordPress (my primary blogging platform)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;456&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also raises concern over the lack of feedback people receive from their postings. With Facebook one cannot determine what was done with your post but on Twitter there is some further delineation as one receives a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgenudge.com/twitter-metrics-researchers/&quot;&gt;tally of impressions, engagements and link clicks&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to real metrics though, this is where the actual blogging site provides more useful data. I recommend embracing metrics, not only to understand your reach but perhaps, just as importantly, to give you the drive to continue your writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most popular post has received 5117 reads, meaning this many took the time to open this blog post to hear what I had to say on the subject. If you were to share your thoughts on an article with colleagues via email, post a new guideline in an office or clinic, or publish an article in a journal, how many people would actually see it? The same information, if cited in a blog post and shared through Facebook, can see a dramatic rise in exposure, along with your interpretation of the work. The aforementioned post for example has had a reach on Facebook of 50934 people to date and was shared 58 times multiplying the distribution many fold. If you published a journal article and were notified of such circulation I suspect you would be jubilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What really motivates those who participate in social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the motivation lies in the three qualities described by Malcolm Gladwell in his book &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;. He described three types of people that are needed for something to go from an idea to widespread adoption; connectors, mavens and salesmen. The doctors out there on social media likely have a little bit of all these characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gladwell said this about connectors: “They are people who “link us up with the world…people with a special gift for bringing the world together”. With respect to mavens he characterised them as having the ability to “start ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth&quot;&gt;word-of-mouth&lt;/a&gt; epidemics’ due to their knowledge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_skills&quot;&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt;, and ability to communicate”. Lastly, salesmen in his view are “persuaders”. These three traits aptly describe those that have waded into this field. They must have the confidence to put their message out there with content that captures people’s attention and certainly have the goal of persuading people that it is worth considering what they have to say. The fundamental drive though comes from a place of harnessing these traits to help people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether writing original content or sharing what others have produced, the social media physician’s goal is generally pure and that is to share knowledge and generate discussion. For example, if you have a new strategy for reducing infection, the active social media physician would ask “why not share this with the world” rather than limit it to your institution or city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frontier like field though does come with some caveats before you dip your feet into the collective pool of the various media sites. As opposed to the more traditional medium of peer reviewed publications there is no one to assess your content prior to its release. You are your own editor and therefore may miss the mark from time to time by missing a relevant publication that might influence your conclusions. You must be prepared for the good and the bad. One can easily appreciate the positive comments that often come but not all posts will be “home runs” and on some occasions the feedback (which will be public) may not be what you had hoped for. You must constantly reflect on your own potential biases yet strive to improve base of knowledge; adding more ‘signal’ than ‘noise’. Respect for patient confidentiality is paramount and within Canada and elsewhere, organisations such as the Canadian Medical Association have set &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/social-media-use.aspx&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for conduct in this space that should be adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you enter into the fray it may surprise you how much information is in fact out there, that now flows to you through global connections. It is an evolving form of communication and one that I am happy to part of. In fact, I am a better Neonatologist for it.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Prophage WO genes recapitulate and enhance Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/c0L8cAOkw10/nature21391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The genus Wolbachia is an archetype of maternally inherited intracellular bacteria that infect the germline of numerous invertebrate species worldwide. They can selfishly alter arthropod sex ratios and reproductive strategies to increase the proportion of the infected matriline in the population. The most common reproductive manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility, which results in embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Females infected with the same Wolbachia strain rescue this lethality. Despite more than 40 years of research and relevance to symbiont-induced speciation, as well as control of arbovirus vectors and agricultural pests, the bacterial genes underlying cytoplasmic incompatibility remain unknown. Here we use comparative and transgenic approaches to demonstrate that two differentially transcribed, co-diverging genes in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO from Wolbachia strain wMel recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility. Dual expression in transgenic, uninfected males of Drosophila melanogaster crossed to uninfected females causes embryonic lethality. Each gene additively augments embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Lethality associates with embryonic defects that parallel those of wild-type cytoplasmic incompatibility and is notably rescued by wMel-infected embryos in all cases. The discovery of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes cifA and cifB pioneers genetic studies of prophage WO-induced reproductive manipulations and informs the continuing use of Wolbachia to control dengue and Zika virus transmission to humans.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: TIRR regulates 53BP1 by masking its histone methyl-lysine binding function</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/os17NCUyOvw/nature21358</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1–TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.

	<content:encoded>Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part II&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series, we got our Oracle Express database up and running against Debian Testing. It involved quite a bit of fiddling but we seemed to get there in the end. In Part II we shall now finish the configuration of the Oracle database and set up the application dependencies. On Part III we will finally get to the Dogen model, and start to make use of ODB. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;What's in a Schema?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do to our database is add the &quot;application users&quot;. This is a common approach to most server side apps, where we tend to have &quot;service users&quot; that login to the database and act upon user requests on their behalf. We can then use audit tables to stamp the user actions so we can monitor them. We can also have application level permissions that stop users from doing silly things. This is of course a step up from the applications in the nineties, where one would have one database account for each user - allowing all sorts of weird and wonderful things such as users connecting directly to databases via ODBC and Excel or Access. I guess nowadays developers don't even know someone thought this to be a good idea at one point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I say &quot;database user&quot;, most developers exposed to RDBMS' immediately associate this to a user account. This is of course how most databases work, but &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; not so with Oracle. In Oracle, &quot;users&quot; and &quot;schemas&quot; are conflated, so much so it's hard to tell if there is any difference between them. For the purist RDBMS user, a schema is a &lt;i&gt;schema&lt;/i&gt; - a collection of tables and other database objects, effectively a namespace - and a user is a &lt;i&gt;user&lt;/i&gt; - a person (real or otherwise) that owns database objects. In Oracle these two more or less map to the same concept. So when you create a user, you have created a schema and you can start adding tables to it; and when you refer to database objects, you prefix them by the user name just as you would if they belonged to a schema. And, of course, you can have users that have no database objects for themselves, but which were granted permission to access database objects from other users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So our first task is to create two schemas; these are required by the Dogen model which we will use as our &quot;application&quot;. They are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I had created some fairly basic tests for ODB support in Dogen. Those entities were placed in the aptly named schema &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;. I then decided to extend the schema with something a bit more meaty, which is where &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt; comes in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the oldest readers, especially those with a Microsoft background, Northwind is bound to conjure memories. Many of us learned Microsoft Access at some point in the nineties, and in those days the samples were pure gold. I was lucky enough to learn about relational databases in my high-school days, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Clipper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase&quot;&gt;dBASE IV&lt;/a&gt;, so the transition to Microsoft Access was more of an exercise in mapping than learning proper. And that's where Northwind came in. It was a &quot;large&quot; database, with forms and queries and tables and all sorts of weird and wonderful things; every time you needed something done to your database you'd check first to see how Northwind had done it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that we are much older, of course, we can see the flaws of Northwind and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommunityCallToActionNOTNorthwind.aspx&quot;&gt;call for its abolition&lt;/a&gt;. But you must remember that in the nineties there was no Internet for most of us - even dial-up was pretty rare where I was - and up-to-date IT books were almost as scarce, so samples were like gold dust. So for all of these historic reasons and as an homage to my olden days, I decided to implement the Northwind schema in Dogen and ODB; it may not cover all corner cases, but it is certainly a step up on my previous &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt; tests. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enough about history and motivations. Returning to our SQLPlus from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, where we were logged in as &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt;, we start first by creating a table space and then the users which will make use of that table space: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create tablespace tbs_01 datafile 'tbs_f01.dbf' size 200M online;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tablespace created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create user basic identified by &quot;PASSWORD&quot; default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;&lt;br /&gt;User created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create user northwind identified by &quot;PASSWORD&quot; default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember to replace &lt;code&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; with your own passwords. This is of course a very simple setup; in the real world you would have to take great care setting the users and table spaces up, including thinking about temporary table spaces and so forth. But for our simplistic purposes this suffices. Now we need to grant these users a couple of useful privileges - again, for a real setup, you'd need quite a bit more: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create session TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create session TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create table TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create table TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create session TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create session TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create table TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create table TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all went well, we should now be able to exit the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; session, start a new one with one of these users, and play with a test table: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ sqlplus northwind@XE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Fri Feb 24 10:20:10 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

To recap, we logged in with user &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;, created a table, inserted some random data and selected it back; all looked ok. Then for good measure, we granted the rights to see this test table to user &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;; logged in as that user and selected the test table, with the expected results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point we consider our Oracle setup completed and we're ready to enter the application world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Enter ODB&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up ODB is fairly easy, especially if you are on Debian: you can simply obtain it from &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;synaptic&lt;/code&gt;. The only slight snag is, I could not find the oracle dependencies (i.e. &lt;code&gt;libodb-oracle&lt;/code&gt;). Likely this is because they depend on OCI, which is non-free, so Debian either does not bother to package it at all or you need some kind of special (non-free) repo for it. As it was, instead of losing myself on wild goose chases, I thought easier to build from source. And since I had to build &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; from source, might as well build &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; (or almost all) to demonstrate the whole process from scratch as it is pretty straightforward, really. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, one warning: best if you either use your package manager &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; build from source. You should probably only mix-and-match if you really know what you are doing; if you do and things get tangled up, it may take you a long while to figure out the source of your woes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the manual approach. I first started by revisiting my previous notes on building ODB; as it happens, I had covered installing ODB from source previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/nerd-food-installing-latest-stable-odb.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for version 2.2. However, those instructions have largely bit-rotted at the Dogen end and things have changed slightly since that post, so a revisit is worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As usual, we start by grabbing all of the packages from the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/download.xhtml&quot;&gt;ODB website&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&quot;&gt;odb 2.4.0-1 amd64.deb&lt;/a&gt;: the ODB compiler itself. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the main ODB library, required by all backends. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-pgsql-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the PostgreSQL backend. We don't need it today, of course, but since PostgreSQL is my DB of choice I always install it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-oracle-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the Oracle backend. We will need this one. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-boost-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the ODB boost profile. This allows using boost types in your Dogen model and having ODB do the right thing in terms of ORM mapping. Our Northwind model does not use boost at present, but I intend to change it as soon as possible as this is a very important feature for customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, if you are too lazy to click on buttons, just use &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ mkdir odb&lt;br /&gt;$ cd odb&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb -O odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;We start with the DEB, as simple as always: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package odb.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 549841 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking odb (2.4.0-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up odb (2.4.0-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.6.1-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tend to store locally built software under my home directory, so that's where we'll place the libraries: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ mkdir ~/local&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember to replace &lt;code&gt;/full/path/to/local&lt;/code&gt; with your installation directory. The process is similar for the other three packages, with one crucial difference: you need to ensure the environment variables are set to place all required dependencies in the include and link path. This is achieved via the venerable environment variables &lt;code&gt;CPPFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; as we shall see). You may bump into &lt;code&gt;--with-libodb&lt;/code&gt;. However, be careful; the documentation states: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these libraries are not installed and you would like to use their build directories instead, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--with-libodb&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;--with-boost&lt;/code&gt; configure options to specify their locations, for example: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./configure --with-boost=/tmp/boost&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you did &lt;code&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt;, you need the environment variables instead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are the shell commands. First boost; do note I am relying on the presence of Debian's system boost; if you have a local build of boost, which is not in the flags below, you will also need to add a path to it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-boost-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;For PostgreSQL again I am relying on the header files installed in Debian. The commands are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-pgsql-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, Oracle. For this we need to supply the locations of the downloaded drivers or else ODB will not find the Oracle header and libraries. If you recall from the previous post, they are located in &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib&lt;/code&gt;, so we must augment the flags with those two paths. In addition, I found &lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt; was failing with errors finding shared objects, so I added &lt;code&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; for good measure. The end result was as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-oracle-2.4.0&lt;br /&gt;$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib&quot; ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there you are; all libraries built and installed into our local directory, ready to be used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this part we've configured the Oracle Express database with the application users, and we sanity checked the configuration. Once that was out of the way, we built and installed all of the ODB libraries required by application code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Part III we will finally start making use of this setup and attempt to connect to the Oracle database. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2017-02-24 Fri 12:32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.1.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part II&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series, we got our Oracle Express database up and running against Debian Testing. It involved quite a bit of fiddling but we seemed to get there in the end. In Part II we shall now finish the configuration of the Oracle database and set up the application dependencies. On Part III we will finally get to the Dogen model, and start to make use of ODB. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;What's in a Schema?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do to our database is add the &quot;application users&quot;. This is a common approach to most server side apps, where we tend to have &quot;service users&quot; that login to the database and act upon user requests on their behalf. We can then use audit tables to stamp the user actions so we can monitor them. We can also have application level permissions that stop users from doing silly things. This is of course a step up from the applications in the nineties, where one would have one database account for each user - allowing all sorts of weird and wonderful things such as users connecting directly to databases via ODBC and Excel or Access. I guess nowadays developers don't even know someone thought this to be a good idea at one point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I say &quot;database user&quot;, most developers exposed to RDBMs immediately associate this to a user account. This is of course how most databases work, but &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; not so with Oracle. In Oracle, &quot;users&quot; and &quot;schemas&quot; are conflated, so much so it's hard to tell if there is any difference between them. For the purist RDBM user, a schema is a &lt;i&gt;schema&lt;/i&gt; - a collection of tables and other database objects, effectively a namespace - and a user is a &lt;i&gt;user&lt;/i&gt; - a person (real or otherwise) that owns database objects. In Oracle these two more or less map to the same concept. So when you create a user, you have created a schema and you can start adding tables to it; and when you refer to database objects, you prefix them by the user name just as you would if they belonged to a schema. And, of course, you can have users that have no database objects for themselves, but which were granted permission to access database objects from other users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So our first task is to create two schemas; these are required by the Dogen model which we will use as our &quot;application&quot;. They are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I had created some fairly basic tests for ODB support in Dogen. Those entities were placed in the aptly named schema &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;. I then decided to extend the schema with something a bit more meaty, which is where &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt; comes in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the oldest readers, especially those with a Microsoft background, Northwind is bound to conjure memories. Many of us learned Microsoft Access at some point in the nineties, and in those days the samples were pure gold. I was lucky enough to learn about relational databases in my high-school days, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Clipper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase&quot;&gt;dBASE IV&lt;/a&gt;, so the transition to Microsoft Access was more of an exercise in mapping than learning proper. And that's where Northwind came in. It was a &quot;large&quot; database, with forms and queries and tables and all sorts of weird and wonderful things; every time you needed something done to your database you'd check first to see how Northwind had done it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that we are much older, of course, we can see the flaws of Northwind and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommunityCallToActionNOTNorthwind.aspx&quot;&gt;call for its abolition&lt;/a&gt;. But you must remember that in the nineties there was no Internet for most of us - even dial-up was pretty rare where I was - and up-to-date IT books were almost as scarce, so samples were like gold dust. So for all of these historic reasons and as an homage to my olden days, I decided to implement the Northwind schema in Dogen and ODB; it may not cover all corner cases, but it is certainly a step up on my previous &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt; tests. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enough about history and motivations. Returning to our SQLPlus from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, where we were logged in as &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt;, we start first by creating a table space and then the users which will make use of that table space: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create tablespace tbs_01 datafile 'tbs_f01.dbf' size 200M online;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tablespace created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create user basic identified by &quot;PASSWORD&quot; default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;&lt;br /&gt;User created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; create user northwind identified by &quot;PASSWORD&quot; default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember to replace &lt;code&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; with your own passwords. This is of course a very simple setup; in the real world you would have to take great care setting the users and table spaces up, including thinking about temporary table spaces and so forth. But for our simplistic purposes this suffices. Now we need to grant these users a couple of useful privileges - again, for a real setup, you'd need quite a bit more: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create session TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create session TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create table TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create table TO basic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create session TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create session TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL&amp;gt; GRANT create table TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;GRANT create table TO northwind;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all went well, we should now be able to exit the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; session, start a new one with one of these users, and play with a test table: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ sqlplus northwind@XE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Fri Feb 24 10:20:10 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

To recap, we logged in with user &lt;code&gt;northwind&lt;/code&gt;, created a table, inserted some random data and selected it back; all looked ok. Then for good measure, we granted the rights to see this test table to user &lt;code&gt;basic&lt;/code&gt;; logged in as that user and selected the test table, with the expected results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point we consider our Oracle setup completed and we're ready to enter the application world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Enter ODB&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up ODB is fairly easy, especially if you are on Debian: you can simply obtain it from &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;synaptic&lt;/code&gt;. The only slight snag is, I could not find the oracle dependencies (i.e. &lt;code&gt;libodb-oracle&lt;/code&gt;). Likely this is because they depend on OCI, which is non-free, so Debian either does not bother to package it at all or you need some kind of special (non-free) repo for it. As it was, instead of losing myself on wild goose chases, I thought easier to build from source. And since I had to build &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; from source, might as well build &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; (or almost all) to demonstrate the whole process from scratch as it is pretty straightforward, really. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, one warning: when it comes to the libraries, best if you either use your package manager &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; build from source. You should probably only mix-and-match if you really know what you are doing; if you do and things get tangled up, it may take you a long while to figure out the source of your woes. Note also that this warning applies to the support libraries but not to the ODB compiler itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the manual approach. I first started by revisiting my previous notes on building ODB; as it happens, I had covered installing ODB from source previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/nerd-food-installing-latest-stable-odb.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for version 2.2. However, those instructions have largely bit-rotted at the Dogen end and things have changed slightly since that post, so a revisit is worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As usual, we start by grabbing all of the packages from the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/download.xhtml&quot;&gt;ODB website&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&quot;&gt;odb 2.4.0-1 amd64.deb&lt;/a&gt;: the ODB compiler itself. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the main ODB library, required by all backends. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-pgsql-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the PostgreSQL backend. We don't need it today, of course, but since PostgreSQL is my DB of choice I always install it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-oracle-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the Oracle backend. We will need this one. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libodb-boost-2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;: the ODB boost profile. This allows using boost types in your Dogen model and having ODB do the right thing in terms of ORM mapping. Our Northwind model does not use boost at present, but I intend to change it as soon as possible as this is a very important feature for customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, if you are too lazy to click on links, just use &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ mkdir odb&lt;br /&gt;$ cd odb&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb -O odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;We start with the DEB, as simple as always: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package odb.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 549841 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking odb (2.4.0-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up odb (2.4.0-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.6.1-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tend to store locally built software under my home directory, so that's where we'll place the libraries: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ mkdir ~/local&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember to replace &lt;code&gt;/full/path/to/local&lt;/code&gt; with your installation directory. The process is similar for the other three packages, with one crucial difference: you need to ensure the environment variables are set to place all required dependencies in the include and link path. This is achieved via the venerable environment variables &lt;code&gt;CPPFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; as we shall see). You may bump into &lt;code&gt;--with-libodb&lt;/code&gt;. However, be careful; the documentation states: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these libraries are not installed and you would like to use their build directories instead, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--with-libodb&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;--with-boost&lt;/code&gt; configure options to specify their locations, for example: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./configure --with-boost=/tmp/boost&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you did &lt;code&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt;, you need the environment variables instead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are the shell commands. First boost; do note I am relying on the presence of Debian's system boost; if you have a local build of boost, which is not in the flags below, you will also need to add a path to it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-boost-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;For PostgreSQL again I am relying on the header files installed in Debian. The commands are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-pgsql-2.4.0/&lt;br /&gt;$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, Oracle. For this we need to supply the locations of the downloaded drivers or else ODB will not find the Oracle header and libraries. If you recall from the previous post, they are located in &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib&lt;/code&gt;, so we must augment the flags with those two paths. In addition, I found &lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt; was failing with errors finding shared objects, so I added &lt;code&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; for good measure. The end result was as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd ..&lt;br /&gt;$ tar -xaf libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;$ cd libodb-oracle-2.4.0&lt;br /&gt;$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib&quot; ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands&lt;br /&gt;$ make -j5&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;$ make install&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there you are; all libraries built and installed into our local directory, ready to be used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this part we've configured the Oracle Express database with the application users, and we sanity checked the configuration. Once that was out of the way, we built and installed all of the ODB libraries required by application code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Part III we will finally start making use of this setup and attempt to connect to the Oracle database.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: There’s such a thing as “autism camouflaging” and it might explain why some people are diagnosed so late</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/24/theres-such-a-thing-as-autism-camouflaging-and-it-might-explain-why-some-people-are-diagnosed-so-late/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autism is usually diagnosed in childhood, some people remain “off the radar” for a long time and only receive a diagnosis much later. One possible reason is that they have learned socially appropriate behaviours, effectively camouflaging their social difficulties, including maintaining eye contact during conversations, memorising jokes or imitating facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of behaviour could have serious consequences for the lives of some people with autism. It is easy to imagine that camouflaging demands significant cognitive effort, leading to mental exhaustion over time, and in extreme cases perhaps also contributing to anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are gender differences in camouflaging, this could also help explain the well-known male preponderance in autism spectrum disorders. At least part of the gender imbalance may, in fact, stem from an under-diagnosis of autism in girls because they are better at “masking” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before now, autism camouflaging has not been studied in a systematic and standardised manner: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361316671012?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&quot;&gt;a recent open-access study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;, by Meng-Chuan Lai and his colleagues, is the first to offer an operationalisation of camouflaging, which they define as the discrepancy between internal and external states in social-interpersonal contexts. For instance, if an autistic person maintains eye contact during a conversation because they have learnt that this is socially appropriate, even though this clashes with how they really want to behave, this would be an example of camouflaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19729&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lai and his colleagues used clinical instruments that are well established in autism research to measure the contrast between internal and external signs of autism among 30 women and 30 men with an established diagnosis of autism. Both gender groups were matched on age (average age: males 27.2 years and females 27.8 years) and intelligence and were free from intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), which includes several tasks requiring social interaction with an experimenter, to measure overt behaviour (external state). And they used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ; a questionnaire assessing autistic traits) and the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test (a computerised task that measures social cognitive ability, e.g. inferring how people feel based on their facial expression) to provide information about internal states. Relatively low scores on the ADOS (i.e. few signs of autism), combined with poor performance on the ASQ and the Reading the Mind in The Eyes, was taken as a sign of camouflaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because camouflaging likely comes at considerable cognitive and emotional costs, the researchers also studied their participants’ levels of anxiety and depression, as well as their executive function. Finally, they also used magnetic resonance imaging to scan the structure of their participants’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers expected, women with autism had significantly higher camouflaging scores than their male counterparts, although there was considerable variability in both groups. Across the whole sample, higher camouflaging scores were associated with higher levels of depression, but not anxiety. When looking at gender differences, the association between camouflaging and depression remained significant only in the men (so it could be speculated that men are more susceptible to the negative consequences of camouflaging). Conversely, verbal intelligence was not associated with camouflaging in either the whole sample or genders separately. Interestingly, camouflaging correlated with executive function in females, but not males. This indicated that women who camouflaged more tended to have better executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent to which individuals with autism engaged in camouflaging was not related to their age. This indicates that camouflaging may not necessarily increase with greater learning experience, as might be expected with older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroanatomical findings differed between sexes, with links between brain structure and camouflaging generally more pronounced in the women. For instance, higher camouflaging was associated with smaller volume in temporal, cerebellar and occipital brain regions in women, but not in men. While there is no easy explanation for this sex difference, it could be speculated that the involved brain areas have a different function in camouflaging for women compared with men. These brain regions are associated with emotional processing, so perhaps they are involved in an emotional component of camouflaging that is more relevant to women. However, this needs to be rigorously examined in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to offer systematic, methodologically sound evidence in support of higher camouflaging in women than men with autism. As such, these results support reports from parents or clinicians that hint at better social skills in girls with autism as compared with boys. However, as the study found evidence of men who engaged in camouflaging and women who did not, camouflaging is unlikely to constitute a uniquely female presentation of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several points that limit the scope of this study. First, the sample size was modest and only included individuals with an established diagnosis of autism who were free from intellectual disability. To study the “real world” implications of camouflaging, it would have been interesting to study people with sub-threshold autistic scores because camouflaging might be one of the reasons why they have remained below diagnostic threshold in the first place. This information might also be relevant for healthcare professionals in terms of both diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the operationalization of camouflaging may be vulnerable to subjective bias: For example, ADOS raters may be guided by implicit gender stereotypes, leading them to give inappropriately high autism scores to girls who behave in more “boyish” ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, this study provides the first systematic definition of camouflaging in individuals with autism and shows that this behaviour is more common in women than men. These clear-cut gender differences highlight the need to consider camouflaging in clinical contexts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Marco Craveiro: Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part I</title>
	<link>http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html</link>
	<content:encoded>Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part I&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen&quot;&gt;Dogen&lt;/a&gt; paying customer, I finally got a chance to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/&quot;&gt;ODB&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com&quot;&gt;Code Synthesis'&lt;/a&gt; amazingly interesting C++ Object-Relational Mapping tool, built on the back of the GCC plugin system. I've personally always been in awe of what Boris Kolpackov has achieved, and, of course, it being a South African company made me all the more keen to use their products. More importantly: the product just seems to rock in terms of polish, features and documentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Astute readers of this blog will point out that Dogen has been supporting ODB for quite some time. That is indeed true, but since I haven't used this feature in anger, I wasn't sure how good the support really was; our fairly trivial database model (&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/projects/input_models/database.dia&quot;&gt;Dia&lt;/a&gt;) explored only a small fraction of what is possible. Now that I finally had a chance to use it in production, I needed to expand the tests and try to replicate the customer's scenario as close as possible. As always in these situations, there was a snag: instead of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; - the RDBMS I had originally used in my Dogen tests - they were using Oracle. So my first task was to setup Oracle locally on my beloved Debian Linux. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Never one to miss an opportunity, I decided this adventure was worthy of a quick blog post; it soon turned out to be a series of posts, if I was to do any justice to this strange and wild experiment, through all of its twists and turns. But hopefully it is worth the effort, as it also demonstrates what you can do with Dogen and ODB. And so, here we are. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first part of the series deals with just trying to convince Oracle to run on Debian Testing - something that &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; Oracle does not support out of the box. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, a word to the wise: this is a &lt;b&gt;highly experimental&lt;/b&gt;Oracle setup, which I embarked upon just because I could; follow it at your own peril, and &lt;b&gt;do not use it anywhere near production&lt;/b&gt;. More generally, if you want to stick to the beaten track, use Oracle on RHEL, CentOS or - god forbid - even Windows. All of that said, if like me, you are a Debian person, well, there's not much for it other than to fire off a VM and start looking for those damned faint tracks in the jungle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Alien Worlds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first stumbling block was Oracle itself. After all, for all the many years of using this RBDMS at work - more than I care to admit in polite company - I suddenly realised I actually never used it at home. Or course, Oracle has supported Linux for a little while now; and the good news is they have a &quot;free&quot; version available: Oracle Database Express Edition (XE). A quick glance at the Oracle website revealed RPM's for 64-bits (Intel only, of course). So before anything else, I decided to brush up my knowledge of Alien. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alien is a debian package that converts RPMs into DEBs. I've used it in the past for another (lovely) Oracle technology: Java. It had worked wonderfully well then so I thought I'd give it a try. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RPM/AlienHowto&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Alien HowTo&lt;/a&gt; is pretty straightforward, and so is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/Alien&quot;&gt;Debian's&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, obtain Alien: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sudo apt-get install alien&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then apply it to the RPM in question. So the next quest was obtaining those darn RPMs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, once you move away from the easy world of Free and Open Source Software, things start to get a bit more complicated. Those lovely links you can easy Google for don't actually work until you sign up for an Oracle developer account, asking &lt;i&gt;all sorts&lt;/i&gt; of personal information. Sadly, even listening to Tesla earnings conferences requires registering these days. Undaunted, I filled all required fields, obtained my developer account and returned to download my loot. For Oracle Express it's rather straightforward: there is a grand-total of one package for Linux 64-bit, so you can't really go wrong. Here's the link, just in case: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Express&lt;/a&gt;: download the 64-bit Linux RPM &lt;code&gt;oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that they decided to zip the RPM but you can easily unzip it with the &lt;code&gt;unzip&lt;/code&gt; tool. The contents are the RPM Alien expects, plus a few oracle specific files which I decided to ignore for now: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ unzip oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;br /&gt;Archive:  oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/upgrade/&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/upgrade/gen_inst.sql&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/response/&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/response/xe.rsp&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a quick glance at the instructions, it appeared the Oracle Express package contained just the database server - that meant it did not include a command line client, or the APIs to build applications that talk to the database. To be fair, this is not an entirely uncommon approach; Debian also packages the PostgreSQL server separately from the development libraries. But behind &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;synaptic&lt;/code&gt;, installation of packages is all so trivial. Not so when you have to go through lots of detailed explanations of different packages and variations. But; onwards! In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html&quot;&gt;Instant client&lt;/a&gt; page, I settled on the downloading the following: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basic&lt;/i&gt;: client shared libraries. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;SQL Plus&lt;/i&gt;: command-line client. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;SDK&lt;/i&gt;: header files to compile code. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: As it turns out, I was wrong on my original expectations, and you don't really need the SQL Plus package - its already included with Oracle Express. But I only figured it out much later, so I'll leave the steps as I originally followed them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all of these packages in hand, I swiftly got busy with Alien, only to also rather swiftly hit an issue: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd Disk1&lt;br /&gt;$ alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;Must run as root to convert to deb format (or you may use fakeroot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, sadly you cannot run alien directly as an unprivileged user. I did not wish to start reading up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/FakeRoot&quot;&gt;FakeRoot&lt;/a&gt; - seems straightforward enough, to be fair, but hey - so I took the easy way out and ran all the Alien commands as root. Note also the &lt;code&gt;--scripts&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the scripts will also get converted across. This will bring us some other… interesting issues, shall we say, but seems worthwhile doing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quite a few seconds later (hey, it was a 300 MB RPM!), a nice looking DEB was generated: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rather promising start. For good measure, I repeated the process with all RPMs, all with similar results: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien  oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voila, all DEBs generated. Of course, as the English love to say, the proof is in the pudding - whatever that means, exactly. So before one can celebrate, you should try to install the generated packages. That can be easily done with our old trusty &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-xe.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 564824 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Executing post-install steps...&lt;br /&gt;/var/lib/dpkg/info/oracle-xe.postinst: line 114: /sbin/chkconfig: No such file or directory&lt;br /&gt;You must run '/etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure' as the root user to configure the database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for systemd (232-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.23-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it seems the error for chkconfig is related to setting up the service to  autostart. Since this was not a key requirement for my purposes, I decided to ignore it. The remaining RPMs - or should I say DEBs - installed beautifully: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-basic.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 564801 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 567895 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-devel.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 567903 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Talking to the Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, at this point in time we have a bunch of stuff installed in all sorts of random (read: Oracle-like) locations. The database itself is under &lt;code&gt;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/&lt;/code&gt;, and all the other packages seemed to have gone into &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64/&lt;/code&gt;. The first task is now to start the database server. For this we can rely on the scripts we installed earlier on. However, before we proceed, one little spoiler: we need to ensure the scripts can find &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;/bin/awk&lt;/code&gt; (these days it lives in &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/awk&lt;/code&gt;). For this we can do a swift (and brutal) hack: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# ln -s /usr/bin/awk /bin/awk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we can configure it. I accepted all of the defaults, and setup a suitably sensible password: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# cd /etc/init.d/&lt;br /&gt;# /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oracle Database 11g Express Edition Configuration&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This will configure on-boot properties of Oracle Database 11g Express&lt;br /&gt;Edition.  The following questions will determine whether the database should&lt;br /&gt;be starting upon system boot, the ports it will use, and the passwords that&lt;br /&gt;will be used for database accounts.  Press &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; to accept the defaults.&lt;br /&gt;Ctrl-C will abort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify the HTTP port that will be used for Oracle Application Express [8080]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify a port that will be used for the database listener [1521]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify a password to be used for database accounts.  Note that the same&lt;br /&gt;password will be used for SYS and SYSTEM.  Oracle recommends the use of&lt;br /&gt;different passwords for each database account.  This can be done after&lt;br /&gt;initial configuration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confirm the password:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want Oracle Database 11g Express Edition to be started on boot (y/n) [y]:y&lt;br /&gt;y&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting Oracle Net Listener...Done&lt;br /&gt;Configuring database...&lt;br /&gt;Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance...Done&lt;br /&gt;Installation completed successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice how your port 8080 has been hogged. If you are using it for other work, you may need to move the Oracle Application Express server to some other port. At any rate, after this I could indeed see a whole load of Oracle processes running: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ps -ef | grep oracle&lt;br /&gt;oracle   20228     1  0 22:35 ?        00:00:00 /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -inhe&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21251     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_pmon_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21253     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_psp0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21257     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_vktm_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21261     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_gen0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21263     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_diag_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21265     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbrm_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21267     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dia0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21269     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_mman_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21271     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbw0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21273     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_lgwr_XE&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye, this seems like a healthy start; but for more details, there are also a bunch of useful logs under the Oracle directories: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log&lt;br /&gt;ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log&lt;br /&gt;total 20&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1369 Feb 23 22:36 CloneRmanRestore.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 7377 Feb 23 22:36 cloneDBCreation.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1278 Feb 23 22:36 postDBCreation.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba  227 Feb 23 22:36 postScripts.log&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, at this point in time, if all had gone according to plan we should be able to connect to our new instance. A typical trick in Oracle is to use &lt;code&gt;tnsping&lt;/code&gt; to validate the setup. For this we need to know what to ping, and that is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/tnsnames.htm#NETRF260&quot;&gt;TNS Names&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cat /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/network/admin/tnsnames.ora&lt;br /&gt;# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XE =&lt;br /&gt;  (DESCRIPTION =&lt;br /&gt;    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = lorenz)(PORT = 1521))&lt;br /&gt;    (CONNECT_DATA =&lt;br /&gt;      (SERVER = DEDICATED)&lt;br /&gt;      (SERVICE_NAME = XE)&lt;br /&gt;    )&lt;br /&gt;  )&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The magic word is &lt;code&gt;XE&lt;/code&gt; (the net service name, i.e. what we will be connecting against). Now we can simply do: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ . /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh&lt;br /&gt;$ tnsping XE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TNS Ping Utility for Linux: Version 11.2.0.2.0 - Production on 23-FEB-2017 22:52:04&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (c) 1997, 2011, Oracle.

Worth noticing that the first step was to call &lt;code&gt;oracle_env.sh&lt;/code&gt; to bring in all the required environment variables of our Oracle setup. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final test at this stage is to ensure we can connect with SQL Plus.

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;OldManWine&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/02/OldManWine-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisdom and grace come with age, but so do mental slowing and increased risk for dementia. As the elderly population continues to grow, preserving brain health to maintain independence and quality of life into older age is a pressing concern. Researchers have identified some unsurprising factors that reduce one’s risk for cognitive decline, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099157/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;education, exercise or a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;. But a more controversial question that continues to perplex scientists is whether alcohol consumption might also stave off cognitive impairment with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The aging brain on alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s experienced the fatigue and brain fog that follow a night of heavy drinking doesn’t need science to explain the dangers of excessive alcohol intake. These health risks may be especially impactful to the older brain, which is already particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors. However, in moderation, a glass of wine or beer may not only be harmless, but may in fact also confer resilience to the aging brain against cognitive decline. Numerous studies have reported that moderate drinking is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19546653&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lower rates of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184039&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;better cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, and slower decline in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659724&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16247047&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executive functions&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, not all studies support the notion that a nightcap can help keep the brain sharp into late life. These discrepant findings raise two obvious questions. First, why are some patterns of drinking neurobiologically healthy, while others are toxic? And second, how can we better identify drinking behaviors that promote the healthiest trajectories of cognitive aging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotective in moderation, neurotoxic in excess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In excess, alcohol works as a neurotoxin on many levels. Studies in animals have shown that binging on ethanol &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11981132&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kills neurons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12437579&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impairs neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;–the birth of new neurons–in the hippocampus, a region critical to creating new memories. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580328/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alcohol-induced dementia&lt;/a&gt; results from brain damage that occurs with prolonged alcohol abuse. The reasons for the observed &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; of alcohol are less clear. In contrast to binge drinking, moderate alcohol intake &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16202182&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increases neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and may help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14600503&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;counteract oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; in neurons. It’s well documented that what’s good for the heart is good for the brain, and indeed, vascular dysfunction often co-exists with or precipitates many forms of dementia.&lt;img alt=&quot;Wine Resveratrol&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-17974&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/01/Wine-Resveratrol-255x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;255&quot; /&gt; A prevailing theory is that the neuroprotective properties of drinking stem largely from their positive effects on cerebrovascular health. Alcohol can reduce risk for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pmj.bmj.com/content/77/914/747.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stroke and heart disease, lower blood pressure and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. However, some evidence that wine is more strongly neuroprotective than other forms of alcohol suggests that resveratrol, a potent antioxidant found in red wine, may also play a role. Although resveratrol &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857553/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimizes dementia pathology&lt;/a&gt; in animals, the extremely high doses required make it unlikely to be the primary source of neuroprotection from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling healthy drinking patterns for the aging brain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our aging population to reap the greatest benefit from alcohol, it will be essential to determine patterns of healthy drinking that are optimized for the individual. This will require, foremost, a comprehensive understanding of how alcohol distinctly affects you versus me based on our genetics, sex or lifestyle. For example, alcohol has been found to differentially influence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15447910&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain structure&lt;/a&gt; and risk for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC516103/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22396249&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; for those with and without the apolipoprotein E4 gene, a strong risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, studies have inconsistently reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271023/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sex differences&lt;/a&gt; in how drinking influences cognitive decline, which may be explained by differences in how men and women metabolize alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite overwhelming evidence that moderate alcohol intake can be healthy for the aging brain, there are striking incongruences across findings–which may be due to differences in study design or confounding factors­–that muddle our understanding of alcohol’s benefits. ‘Survival bias,’ in which healthier individuals participate in studies for longer, is an unavoidable complication in longitudinal studies of aging. This could significantly skew results if unhealthy drinkers drop out early, leaving only “healthy” drinkers to be studied in very old age. Furthermore, most human studies on alcohol and brain aging rely on observed associations, which can be replete with confounding factors. For instance, it’s known that drinkers tend to live more healthy lifestyles (e.g., they may exercise more or follow a Mediterranean diet), or may drink more often simply because they’re more socially active, which alone is known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19173101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to be brain-healthy&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, effects of alcohol on cognitive aging may depend on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12427876&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;type of alcohol&lt;/a&gt; consumed, how alcohol intake is measured, or the definition of “non-drinkers.” Many studies group life-long abstainers together with quitters, who may avoid alcohol due to poor health or may have developed health problems from alcohol abuse. However, my postdoctoral adviser Linda McEvoy, who studies effects of alcohol on brain aging at UC San Diego, explains that “Randomized controlled trials offer a better alternative to more definitely answer the question of how moderate alcohol intake affects cognitive function. Such trials have demonstrated beneficial cardiometabolic effects in those randomized to drink moderate amounts of alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prescription for alcohol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some uncertainties in the research so far, it appears that regular moderate drinking is unlikely to be hazardous to cognitive function and may even support healthy brain aging. Until we have further clarification, McEvoy offers some advice to those hoping to preserve brain health into late life: “If a person consumes alcohol, I would advise drinking moderate amounts of alcohol (one or two drinks) with dinner. If the person does not drink, I would not advise starting. Some individuals have a hard time controlling the amount they drink, and heavy drinking has detrimental effects on brain health and cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;
