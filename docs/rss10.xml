	<content:encoded>Brain responses to emotion stimuli are highly variable even within the same individual, and this could be a problem for researchers who seek to use these responses as biomarkers to help diagnose and treat disorders such as depression.

That's according to a new paper in Neuroimage, from University College London neuroscientists Camilla Nord and colleagues.



Nord et al. had 29 volunteers perform three tasks during fMRI scanning. All of the tasks involved pictures of emotional faces, which</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheffield.academia.edu/ElizabethKirkham&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Kirkham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the riddle about the doctor? A father and his son are involved in a car accident and taken to different hospitals, the boy to a children’s hospital and the father to the general hospital. When the boy arrives at hospital, the doctor on call is shocked, saying “I can’t treat this boy, he’s my son!” The question is: who’s the doctor? The answer, as with many riddles, is obvious once you know it: the doctor is the boy’s mother. Years ago when I first heard this riddle, I was stumped, even though the only doctor I had contact with in my own life happened to be a woman. The very fact that this question works as a riddle is testament to the strength of negative stereotypes surrounding women’s scientific abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who take degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects do just as well as their male colleagues, even though they are far outnumbered by them: in the UK, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/uploads/wise/files/WISE_UK_Statistics_2014.pdf&quot;&gt;14 per cent of engineering and technology students, and 17 per cent of computer science&lt;/a&gt; students are women. The picture is similar in the USA, where Catherine Riegle-Crumb and Karisma Morton carried out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00329/full&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published recently in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, to investigate why the numbers are so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24045&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the time of life when occupational ambitions begin to take shape: adolescence. Adolescence is also a time when, for better or worse, individuals become increasingly conscious of their peers’ opinions. In light of this, it stands to reason that teenagers’ decisions about their future could be influenced by the attitudes of those around them, both positively and negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured the science and gender-related attitudes of male and female students aged 13 to 14 in science classrooms across a number of schools. On average, just two per cent of girls believed that boys were better at science and 29 per cent of girls were very confident in their science ability, but 16 per cent of boys endorsed gender/STEM stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers caught up with the same students a year later, and asked them to indicate which subjects they were likely to study at university. The findings differed markedly by STEM subject: of those intending to study biological or physical sciences, slightly more (52 per cent vs. 48 per cent) were girls, and for these subjects, neither the proportion of boys endorsing stereotypes nor the proportion of girls with high science confidence influenced girls’ intentions to pursue these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, only 33 per cent of students intending to study computer science or engineering were girls. Crucially, girls’ intentions to study these subjects &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; influenced by their classroom environments, decreasing as the proportion of male classroom peers with stereotypical views increased, and increasing as the proportion of female peers who were very confident in their scientific ability increased. Boys’ intentions to study STEM subjects were not affected by these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings suggest social attitudes swirling around the classroom are affecting girls’ scientific ambitions in important ways. But if we can’t eradicate gender stereotypes, what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings give us an answer: provide girls with positive role models, whether these are female peers who are confident in their scientific abilities, or women scientists who can talk about their achievements and passion for their fields. Initiatives such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/&quot;&gt;WISE campaign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inspiringthefuture.org/volunteers/inspiring-women/&quot;&gt;Inspiring the Future&lt;/a&gt; facilitate opportunities for women to speak to young people about their own careers and areas of interest. And there is reason to be optimistic – the girls in this research were not deterred from studying biological or physical sciences, despite the presence of unhelpful stereotypes in their classrooms. With the right support and guidance, it may not be long before we can say the same about other STEM subjects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Child-Sleep-Blog-image-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising rates of childhood overweight and obesity have brought physical activity, healthy eating, and sedentary behaviour to the forefront of public health discussions. Lingering in the background is the essential, yet often overlooked, behaviour: sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its influence on cognitive and physical development, lack of sleep continues to be implicated in the child obesity epidemic. Inadequate sleep increases the risk of child obesity, both independently and by negatively affecting children’s physical activity levels and hormones associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep continues to be implicated in the child obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, children’s sleep duration has been decreasing in recent decades, thus prompting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.participaction.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2016%20ParticipACTION%20Report%20Card%20-%20Full%20Report.pdf&quot;&gt;2016 ParticipACTION Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth&lt;/a&gt; to ask, “Are Canadian kids too tired to move?” This key report also highlighted the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/24hrGlines/Canadian24HourMovementGuidelines2016.pdf&quot;&gt;Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth&lt;/a&gt;, which reveal that a healthy 24 hours includes an uninterrupted, consistent 9 to 11 hours of sleep per night for those aged 5–13 years, and 8 to 10 hours per night for those aged 14–17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3245-0&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; on child physical activity, healthy eating, and screen time presented a framework for classifying parental support behaviours. Parents’ behaviours also play a key role in influencing the sleep patterns of children across a range of ages. For our current study, we explored the contribution of motivational (encouragement) and regulatory (rule enforcement) parental support behaviours for predicting whether or not children meet the aforementioned sleep guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were collected by Public Health Ontario using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) of parents or guardians living in Ontario, Canada. Our analyses included description of the sample by demographic characteristics, parental support behaviours, and child sleep duration; as well as construction of two multivariable logistic regression models to predict whether or not parents reported their child was meeting sleep guidelines – one for weekday sleep and another for sleep on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that as children enter and progress through adolescence, the proportion of children meeting Canadian sleep guidelines decreases, as do the proportion of parents engaging in support behaviours for sleep. Taken together, this suggests that the time period when parents are less engaged, may actually be when their kids most need the support. (Parents of unruly, sleepy teenagers will rightfully contend that this is easier said than done). Nonetheless, given that around 94% of parents reported encouraging their child to go to bed at a specific time, and just over 84% reported enforcing bedtime rules, it is clear that parents are aware and trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study also revealed that parents who reported encouraging their child to go to bed at a specific time were less likely to have children meeting sleep guidelines on weekdays. While initially surprising, it is not unreasonable to speculate that encouragement may be a parent’s reaction to their child’s already-established poor sleep habits. In other words, this may be a “chicken or the egg” problem, in which parents’ encouragement doesn’t produce poor sleep habits, but rather, children’s’ poor sleep habits prompt parents to encourage them to get to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, on weekends, none of the parental support behaviors were found to contribute to children meeting sleep guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents who reported enforcing rules about their child’s bedtime were more likely to have their child meeting sleep guidelines on weekdays, which may reflect general parental expectations, bedtime structure, or the proactive nature of rule-setting. Unexpectedly, on weekends, none of the parental support behaviors were found to contribute to children meeting sleep guidelines. That is not to say that parents have no control over their kid’s sleep on weekends, but weekends are often viewed as “wildcard” days with less consistent bed/wake time, and more activities that may impede sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is evident that use and presence of screens in the bedroom can negatively affect children’s sleep; however, our study found that neither rules nor encouragement to limit screens in the bedroom had an effect on children getting sufficient sleep. To help make sense of this finding, consider the use of a family living room only a few decades ago, in which “screen time” (often a single television) could be easily measured and controlled by parents. Now consider present day screen time, in its many forms, representing a highly unstructured activity with no clear starting and end point. The smaller and more portable the device, the easier it is to use in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that now, more than ever, parents face challenges to effectively supporting child healthy behaviours, due to the pervasiveness of electronic media. It will be important for future studies to focus on how parental support behaviours can be made most effective, and what can be modified in the home environment to support children getting a good nights sleep. Children—even more than our cell phones, laptops, and tablets—need to recharge, and parents are instrumental in helping them do so.&lt;/p&gt;

(2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?&quot;&gt;prodromal states&lt;/a&gt; have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, &lt;strike&gt;Frazier&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fraser et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DementiaBank&lt;/a&gt; database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using factor analysis, the researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four dimensions of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;were most indicative of dementia: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semantic impairment&lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;using overly simple words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acoustic impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;e.g., speaking more  slowly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntactic impairment  &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;using less complex grammar &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berisha et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; examined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantified linguistic features included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of unique words&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-specific nouns – e.g., &lt;i&gt;thing, something, anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filler words – &lt;i&gt;well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-imageability, high frequency verbs &lt;i&gt;– e.g., &lt;i&gt;get, give, go, have, do&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Reagan showed a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feb. 16 press conference&lt;/a&gt;, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Personality Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (NPD), as speculated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; grandiose status as POTUS): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing constant admiration from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pompous and arrogant demeanor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And we can call him &lt;b&gt;narcissistic&lt;/b&gt; in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;NY Times&lt;/i&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by 35 mental health professionals?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forcefully argued&lt;/a&gt; that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discourse Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is probably my favorite part so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called nuclear weapons  and other &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, lots of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with uranium,  including some bad &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Russia.  I've &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for Russia.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;train wreck&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!&lt;/b&gt; But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below). Letterman has aged too, so you might as well analyze his speech as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors performed... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...a 10-fold cross-validation procedure in which a unique 10% of the data (i.e., the ‘test set’) are used in each iteration for evaluation, and the remaining 90% (i.e., the ‘training set’) are used to select the most useful features (of the 370 available as described in “Features” above) and construct our models. The reported accuracy is an average across the 10 folds. In a given fold, data from any individual speaker can occur in the test set or the training set, but not both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A show-stopping limitation is that the two groups were not matched for age or education. The mean age was 71.8 for AD vs. 65.2 for controls, and years of education 12.5 vs. 14.1 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Markers Found in Speech Patterns&lt;/a&gt; (link via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aholdenj/status/824801091007115268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@aholdenj&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;BTW, they're not supposed to diagnose non-patients, that's unethical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F25633673&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Tracking+discourse+complexity+preceding+Alzheimer%27s+disease+diagnosis%3A+a+case+study+comparing+the+press+conferences+of+Presidents+Ronald+Reagan+and+George+Herbert+Walker+Bush.&amp;amp;rft.issn=1387-2877&amp;amp;rft.date=2015&amp;amp;rft.volume=45&amp;amp;rft.issue=3&amp;amp;rft.spage=959&amp;amp;rft.epage=63&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Berisha+V&amp;amp;rft.au=Wang+S&amp;amp;rft.au=LaCross+A&amp;amp;rft.au=Liss+J&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CNeuroscience%2CCognitive+Psychology%2C+Language&quot;&gt;Berisha V, Wang S, LaCross A, &amp;amp; Liss J (2015).

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/22/sounding-out-the-properties-of-dna/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-music-notes-edited-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomics researchers are all too used to seeing DNA sequences represented as long lists of A, T, C and Gs but could there be a better way to analyze this data? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1632-x&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_mark_temple&quot;&gt;Dr Mark Temple&lt;/a&gt; of Western Sydney University suggests that representing DNA as musical notes could aid us in identifying stop and start codons and even help us to spot mutations that otherwise could prove much more difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound has been used in the past to help aid analysis; even as far back as 1948, Alan Turing’s computer used different sounds to help indicate the progress of software to the user. As the amount of available genomic data increases, researchers are increasingly seeking new ways to analyze and seek out unique features. Using sound to identify these features – in the same way that Turing’s machine used sound to identify progress – could provide a novel way of processing these large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9012&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DNA representation (Andy Leppard, Flickr CC)&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9012&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-representation-Andy-Leppard-Flickr-300x203.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;DNA representation (Andy Leppard, Flickr CC)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Temple developed six separate sonification algorithms that could each parse a DNA sequence and convert it into a musical score. Some of the algorithms worked by treating each nucleotide as an individual note, while others used di- or tri-nucleotide groups, the protein sequence itself, or the codon reading frames. The resulting musical notation can then be played in the same way as any conventional music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12859-017-1632-x/MediaObjects/12859_2017_1632_MOESM8_ESM.mp3&quot;&gt;Listen – track eight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12859-017-1632-x/MediaObjects/12859_2017_1632_MOESM12_ESM.mp3&quot;&gt;Listen – track twelve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is particularly useful as it can highlight start and stop codons by using them to turn the music on or off, making those points in the DNA sequence abundantly clear. And this could be just the beginning of sound-based DNA analysis. As further research is carried out in this area, software could be developed that uses different sounds to represent features like binding sites, restriction endonucleases sites and SNPs. Today’s DNA sequence browsers may use conventional analysis tools but perhaps we will soon see sonification algorithms like these included as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while we may not see a DNA-based song topping iTunes, DNA sonification may open new avenues in DNA sequence analysis for researchers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: New insights into an underlying influence for mitochondrial shaping</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/22/new-insights-underlying-influence-mitochondrial-shaping/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Drosophila-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the wonders of the molecular world, the enzyme ATP synthase is responsible for the energy storage in most life forms. In the past, its own mechanisms surprised scientists when it was discovered that it functions like a machine; working in a ‘dual motor’ system and producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATP is used within cells as a coenzyme, and is said to be ‘the energy currency of life’. It plays a key role in the conversion of mitochondrial energy in mammals. As a chemical energy storing nucleotide, it releases its energy once broken down into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP). This organic compound (ADP) influences the flow of energy across cells, and plays a key role in metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmccellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12860-017-0132-1&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccellbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, led by Eric Sawyer, Elizabeth Brunner, and Karen Hales at Davidson College (NC, USA), new insights are presented for the role of ATP synthase in the fruit fly &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scientific research, this genus has established itself as a reliable model to observe such processes. While analysing the testis of this species, it was found that the various subunits of ATP synthase contribute to the shaping of the Nebenkern – a mitochondrial formation within insect sperm. This structure resembles an onion-like form, due to mitochondria interlocking together after cell division has occurred. This spherical form has a complicated morphology made up of two masses that densely pack together as a result of mitochondrial fusion. Following this process, the two components of this structure re-organise, when they are unravelled and elongated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9005 alignright&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/microscope-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;314&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms underlying these curious mitochondrial processes has been an area of growing research, as previously studied in a range of systems from yeast to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this newly presented study, researchers are observing the process of spermatozoa production following cell division (spermatogenesis) in the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; species. This can act as a useful analogue, potentially helping us understand the molecular processes in other related systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to understanding its role across biological systems, comprehending the processes of ATP synthase is of direct importance to humans, as any defects in its processes can contribute to the development of neuromuscular disorders and various diseases (as the authors indicate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmccellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12860-017-0132-1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccellbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; presents the first piece of evidence which links tissue-specific ATP synthase subunits with tissue-specific mitochondrial shaping processes. These findings demonstrate the impact of cell processes on tissue morphogenesis, and contribute to the on-going research of ATP synthase’s influence on membrane conformation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structure of a pre-catalytic spliceosome</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8EGeezc4ktw/nature22799</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Intron removal requires assembly of the spliceosome on pre-mRNA and extensive remodelling to form the spliceosome’s catalytic centre. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast pre-catalytic B complex spliceosome at near-atomic resolution. The mobile U2 snRNP associates with U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP through U2/U6 helix II and an interface between U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U2 snRNP SF3b-containing domain, which also transiently contacts the helicase Brr2. The U2 snRNP 3’ region is flexibly attached to the SF3b-containing domain and protrudes over the concave surface of tri-snRNP, where the U1 snRNP may reside before its release from the pre-mRNA 5’-splice site. The U6 ACAGAGA sequence forms a hairpin which weakly tethers the 5’-splice site. B complex proteins Prp38, Snu23, and Spp381 bind the Prp8 N-terminal domain and stabilise U6 ACAGAGA stem–pre-mRNA and Brr2–U4 snRNA interactions. These results provide important insights into the events leading to active site formation.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The sunflower genome provides insights into oil metabolism, flowering and Asterid evolution</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ATqfqqU5M_k/nature22380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., is a global oil crop that has promise for climate change adaptation, because it can maintain stable yields across a wide variety of environmental conditions, including drought. Even greater resilience is achievable through the mining of resistance alleles from compatible wild sunflower relatives, including numerous extremophile species. Here we report a high-quality reference for the sunflower genome (3.6 gigabases), together with extensive transcriptomic data from vegetative and floral organs. The genome mostly consists of highly similar, related sequences and required single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies for successful assembly. Genome analyses enabled the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Asterids, further establishing the existence of a whole-genome triplication at the base of the Asterids II clade and a sunflower-specific whole-genome duplication around 29 million years ago. An integrative approach combining quantitative genetics, expression and diversity data permitted development of comprehensive gene networks for two major breeding traits, flowering time and oil metabolism, and revealed new candidate genes in these networks. We found that the genomic architecture of flowering time has been shaped by the most recent whole-genome duplication, which suggests that ancient paralogues can remain in the same regulatory networks for dozens of millions of years. This genome represents a cornerstone for future research programs aiming to exploit genetic diversity to improve biotic and abiotic stress resistance and oil production, while also considering agricultural constraints and human nutritional needs.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A neural circuit architecture for angular integration in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/vUCU6hvkT34/nature22343</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Many animals keep track of their angular heading over time while navigating through their environment. However, a neural-circuit architecture for computing heading has not been experimentally defined in any species. Here we describe a set of clockwise- and anticlockwise-shifting neurons in the Drosophila central complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to rotate an angular heading estimate based on the fly’s angular velocity. We show that each class of shifting neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly’s heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform integration.

&lt;p&gt;One day neuroscience might revolutionise education, but for now the scientific findings most relevant to teaching and learning come from psychology. In fact, many popular claims about the brain and learning are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/Index/Great_Myths_of_the_Brain.html&quot;&gt;neuromyths&lt;/a&gt; – unsubstantiated or plain wrong ideas, such as that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;we only use ten per cent of our brains&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;some of us are left-brained, others right-brained&lt;/a&gt;, or that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;we learn best when taught via our preferred “learning style”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately and often with the best of intentions, surveys have shown that a lot of teachers believe these myths (for instance, one &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00429/full&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; published in 2012 found that British and Dutch teachers believed around half of the 15 neuromyths they were tested on). Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00629/full&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has focused on German music teachers and students to see how vulnerable they are to brain myths pertaining specifically to music. Although the participants showed some ability to distinguish between true facts and myths, they still endorsed around 40 per cent of the myths, especially those that contained neuroscientific jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23808&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nina Düvel and her colleagues at the Hanover Music Lab asked four experts in the fields of the neuroscience of music or the neuroscience of music education to agree on seven music-related brain facts, and seven music-related brain myths. Among the facts: the idea that music education can benefit language skills and that the anatomy of the brain can change in response to musical training. Among the myths: that right handers process music in the right hemisphere and that musical education boosts children’s intelligence. See box below for the full list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers challenged 91 music teachers from a random selection of state schools in Germany and 125 students studying to be music teachers at German universities to read through a list of the 14 myths and facts presented in random order and identify which were scientifically substantiated and which unsubstantiated. To avoid raising undue suspicion, there was no mention of “neuromyths” in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although statistically speaking the participants were able to distinguish facts from myths better than if they’d simply been guessing, it remained the case that the teachers and students endorsed, on average, around 40 per cent of the myths, mistakenly believing them to be scientifically supported facts. The myths that contained neuroscientific jargon  (referencing “brain hemispheres” and “cognitive abilities”) were the most widely believed. On the plus side, the more books, magazines and websites that participants said they had read in relation to psychology and neuroscience, the less vulnerable they were to the myths (this is in contrast to the 2012 survey of school teachers where greater general knowledge about the brain correlated with more belief in neuromyths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Düvel and her team said “the present study shows that there is a gap between the state of research in neuroscience related to music education and the knowledge of current and future music teachers about these findings and neuromyths”. This is worrying, they added, in the sense that time could be wasted on harmful, ineffective practices. The researchers concluded that perhaps “a lack of communication between scientists and music educators is to blame.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/18/positive-psychology-expressive-writing-and-the-confidence-cult-bps-2017/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/3420495837_07e4bd933f_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference boasted an impressive line-up of keynote speakers. The ‘father of’ positive psychology &lt;a href=&quot;https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/people/martin-ep-seligman&quot;&gt;Martin Seligman&lt;/a&gt; (University of Pennsylvanna, USA) provided a fascinating summary of the ever growing field and discussed his updated theory of well-being, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/learn&quot;&gt;PERMA&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;ositive emotion, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ngagement, &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;elationships, &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;eaning and purpose, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ccomplishment). Helen Bevan (&lt;em&gt;Chief Transformation Officer, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theedge.nhsiq.nhs.uk/about/horizons-team/&quot;&gt;Horizons team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, NHS England) discussed her experience of ‘Leading change into the future’ – of particular interest was her experience of using social media and disease specific patient forums as platforms to aid healthcare transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8999&quot; style=&quot;width: 279px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rosalind Gill&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8999&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/C_jMETlXYAEqlKPcropped-269x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;269&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Rosalind Gill&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/rosalind-gill&quot;&gt;Rosaline Gill&lt;/a&gt; (City University London, UK) provided a stimulating critique of what she has termed the ‘confidence cult’ – the mindset that “whatever the problem, confidence is the solution”; she highlighted some of the key ways in which social questions of inequality are inappropriately portrayed as individual psychological issues, using pertinent examples from mainstream advertising to her illustrate the problem in relation to gender inequality. Last but not least, &lt;a href=&quot;http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/pennebak&quot;&gt;James W Pennebaker&lt;/a&gt; (University of Texas at Austin, USA) began the last keynote of the 2017 conference by discussing his early work exploring the links between emotion, language and health; which culminated in his finding that expressive writing interventions can improve both physical and mental health. He went on to focus on his current research studying how the use of everyday language reflects personality, with a particularly fascinating analysis of the linguistics of US presidential debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8998&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;James W Pennebaker&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8998&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/IMG_6547-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;James W Pennebaker&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication crisis averted? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns that scientific results are often not reproducible is by no means limited to the field of psychology. However, when the scale of the problem in psychology was &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716&quot;&gt;revealed by the Open Science Collaboration in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, rather than despair the psychology community has used its replication crisis as an opportunity to focus on improving research practices. In the vein of the ‘Replication and Reproducibility in Psychology event’ held in 2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/06/22/replication-reproducibility-psychology-debate-continues/&quot;&gt;summarized in this blog&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/profile/1300/1026/daryl_o'connor&quot;&gt;Daryl O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; (Leeds University, UK) hosted a workshop designed to improve scientific practice, research methods and transparency. Using a series of elegant &lt;a href=&quot;https://lawsofthought.github.io/replication-crisis-demos/&quot;&gt;statistical demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/social-sciences/mark-andrews&quot;&gt;Mark Andrews&lt;/a&gt; (Nottingham Trent University, UK) highlighted the flaws in the current statistical system and the importance of conducting replicable, well powered, and statistically strong research. The discussion centered on possible solutions for improving reproducibility, including pre-registering studies and providing improved statistical inference training to undergraduates and early career researchers. We hope that &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt; can be part of the solution! &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has a policy of publishing all sound science, thus aiming to reduce the impact of publication bias that may currently exist within the field of psychology; we do not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact, and encourage submissions of replication studies and null results. We operate an open peer review model in order to increase transparency. In addition, we are now trialing &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/about/results-free-peer-review-for-authors&quot;&gt;Results-free review&lt;/a&gt;, a new model of peer review, where editors and reviewers are blinded to the results, focusing editorial decisions on the rationale and methods alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wellbeing and social inequalities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that certain populations experience prejudice, discrimination and stigma, and have disparities in both physical and mental health. The psychological aspects of social inequalities in various ‘minority’ populations were a major focus of the conference. This included the ‘Sexuality and wellbeing’ session which kicked off the first day of the conference. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uea.ac.uk/medicine/people/profile/j-semlyen&quot;&gt;Joanna Semlyen&lt;/a&gt; discussed the importance of using population representative data to investigate inequalities in mental health, including her study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry,&lt;/em&gt; which demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) populations are twice as likely to suffer from common mental disorders and/or low wellbeing, than heterosexual adults. Joanna discusses her work in more details in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/04/06/sexual-orientation-mental-health/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;. In the same symposium &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.york.ac.uk/sociology/our-staff/academic/celia-kitzinger/&quot;&gt;Celia Kitzinger&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the fact that despite the UK being ranked best in the world for end of life care, LGBT individuals face significant discrimination during this already difficult time. Another interesting discussion was found in the ‘Wellbeing in Dementia’ session; Linda Clare discussed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealproject.org.uk/&quot;&gt;IDEAL project&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on improving the quality of life of those living with dementia and Peter Mittler talked about his work to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dementiaallianceinternational.org/?s=peter+mittler&quot;&gt;improve the human rights of those living with dementia&lt;/a&gt;, following his own diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media psychology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is embedded in today’s society, with many people using some form of social media on a daily basis. Another big focus of the conference was the psychology of social media. &lt;a href=&quot;http://martingraff.com/&quot;&gt;Martin Graff&lt;/a&gt; presented his recent study examining how receiving ‘likes’ and other kinds of online validation influence the way people interact on social media; he demonstrated that personality and self-esteem are key factors in the individuals responses to online validation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-davis-94aa5069/?ppe=1&quot;&gt;Megan Davis&lt;/a&gt; then demonstrated how the content of online messages can predict adverse dating experiences, suggesting that this can be used by online daters to take appropriate precautions when deciding to meet online communication partners face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Introduction to signal processing using FFT</title>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2017/05/18/introduction-to-signal-processing-using-fft.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Fourier Transform takes a signal (usually acoustic or any sequence of data) and finds the frequencies that are dominant in the signal.  For example: A pure middle 'C' note from piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;loweralpha simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source separation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying emotions in voices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's important for me as I am researching in emotion detection from speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a very efficient algorithm for computing the power spectrum (Fourier transform). The normal Fourier Transform is a O(N^2), whereas FFT is O( N log(N)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this workshop I will show how FFT can be performed in real-time and I will show how human voices produce different power spectrum.  I will also let the audience see what their own vocal profile looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLOS is pleased to announce the appointment of Alison Mudditt as its Chief Executive Officer, effective June 19, 2017.  For the past six years Mudditt served as Director of University of California Press (UC Press) where she ushered in new strategies to lead the company into the digital age, including the innovative journal and monograph Open Access programs Collabra and Luminos. Prior to UC Press, Mudditt was Executive Vice President at SAGE Publications, Inc., leading publishing programs across books, journals and digital platforms. Her 25 plus years in the publishing industry include leadership positions at Blackwell Publishers in Oxford, UK and Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Inc., in Philadelphia, US. Mudditt received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Bath and her Master of Business Administration from The Open University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PLOS is truly privileged to bring on board a person of Alison’s caliber whose extensive experience in and deep knowledge of academic publishing will invigorate a renewed focus on our mission—transforming research communication to better serve authors, readers and the public,” said Gary Ward, Chairman of the Board at PLOS. “Her history and accomplishments as a leader, coalition builder and strategic thinker for organizations experiencing change is impressive and will prove very valuable to PLOS in the years ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to join a like-minded publisher in PLOS, which fully embraces the Open Access principles that drive its mission,” said Mudditt. “PLOS’ long-held reputation as a change agent in this industry provides a tremendously gratifying challenge as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in scientific publishing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a stereotype that has improved a little over the years but still persists: women are more emotionally expressive than men. Like Bridget Jones, we constantly reveal exactly how we’re feeling, while men, Mark Darcy-like, look on impassively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although prior evidence suggests that women &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.305&quot;&gt;really do smile more often&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173942&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;, has considered a greater variety of facial expressions, and it finds that the gender pattern is more complex, with some emotions displayed more by men than women. Arguably, this work helps to reveal not only differences in the emotional signals men and women send to others, but also differences in the emotions that we feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23968&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel McDuff of Microsoft Research, Redmond, US and his team used a new automated facial coding technology to analyse the expressions of 2,106 people as they watched a series of 10 video adverts at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were crowdsourced from France, Germany, China, the US and the UK. While they watched ads from their own countries on everything from confectionary to cars, their webcams streamed images of their faces to a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women smiled more than the men, replicating the earlier research. They also engaged in more “inner brow raises”, an expression taken to indicate fear or sadness. But the men frowned more. Frowns are usually taken to be a show of anger, though the researchers noted that in this study, they might have reflected greater concentration, or confusion. There were no gender differences in some other expressions, including downturned mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate in psychology about the extent to which facial expressions, including smiles and frowns, actually reflect and match felt emotions. When you smile, is it always because you’re feeling happy? Or do you sometimes smile when you’re anxious? And just because you’re frowning, does it necessarily mean you’re mad – or you just want someone else to think you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given work &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;amp;doi=10.1037/1528-3542.5.2.175&quot;&gt;suggesting there is a close association&lt;/a&gt; between emotions and facial expressions, an implication of the new results is that women are more prone to feeling happy and also more anxious (or at least more inclined to show these emotions), and that men are more likely to feel angry (or more confused…), which raises the question of why might this be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDuff and his team suggested that at least part of the explanation could be down to the different social expectations and pressures placed on the genders. For example, there’s evidence that in many countries, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022104268387&quot;&gt;happiness is seen as more desirable for girls than boys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an account would help explain why the size of the observed gender differences varied around the world, being the smallest in the UK, consistent with the idea that gender-related social expectations are less marked in some countries than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few other geographical differences: women in the US were the smiliest, while women in the UK and Germany frowned least. But the general data patterns in each of the five countries were the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation with the study was the fact that volunteers knew they were being videoed, which might have influenced their reactions. But a major advantage was the use of rapid automated coding technology. This allowed for many more participants than would normally be practical in research on facial expressions, which are usually decoded by a researcher. Crowdsourcing volunteers and using computer-based decoding, as in this case, could open the way for many more mass-studies of emotion and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Best and Worst of Neuroscience and Neurology – April 2017</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/17/best-and-worst-of-neuroscience-and-neurology-april-2017/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2017.00120/full&quot;&gt;neuroscience publications&lt;/a&gt; steadily grows over the years. In 2006, around 27,000 paper on this subject were published, while in 2015 this number went up to almost 37,000. This is a seriously big increase that reflects the importance of brain science and the growing interest in this field of research. The selection of articles presented here covers a wide range of topics, from purely academic subjects to the findings of clinical significance and newly discovered facts that will be of interest to almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 25 April 1971, David Eagleman was celebrating his birthday. David is probably one of the best known neuroscientists these days, thanks to his books and TV series. In the academic world, Dr Eagleman is better known for hit works on the relationship between timing of perception and timing of neural signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEST &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New type of cells discovered in brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4558.html&quot;&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; touches again on how little we still know about the brain. A new type of brain cell, mural lymphatic endothelial cells&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; were reported in the article published this week. The function of these cells, which are &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/12/microglia-part-1-definitions-and-developmental-progression/&quot;&gt;lymphatic&lt;/a&gt; in their origin, is to clean up the brain from accumulating cellular debris and thus prevent the damage to normal healthy cells of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial synapse capable of learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain synapses are central for our ability to learn. Stimulation of synapses strengthen the connection between the neurons and thus enhances the learning. A similar approach was used when researchers created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14736&quot;&gt;electronic synapse&lt;/a&gt; called memristor. Although the physical components of this nano-device have nothing to do with the real synapses in brain, the underlying principle is still the same. The devices of this kind will be important for the developing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/08/20/creating-an-artificial-brain/&quot;&gt;artificial brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doxycycline for treating Parkinson’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doxycycline has been used to treat bacterial infection for well over 50 years. New &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41755&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this antibiotic may have a new application: to treat Parkinson’s disease. This disease is caused by abnormal accumulation and toxicity of protein alpha-synuclein. In cell culture, the scientists observed that the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates is reduced by 80% in the presence of doxycycline. Mice models with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; fed on the diet with addition of doxycycline improved their symptoms. Human trials with low doses of doxycycline are now being planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelics and higher state of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of psychedelics such as LSD on brain function are poorly studied. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month has reported that psychedelics induce increased signal diversity, as shown by brain imaging methods. Signal diversity is considered to be a measure of the complexity of brain activity. In the subjects exposed to the drugs, this measure was higher then the baseline value in the normal condition. Researchers conclude that, under the influence of psychedelics, the brain experiences a changed state of consciousness. The question remains whether this is a ‘better’ or more desirable state, and whether the psychedelic drugs can be used for &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/05/psychedelic-assisted-therapy-the-mental-health-trip-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;therapeutic applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing brain tissue in a lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling the brain is very hard due to the complexity of this organ. While most other tissues and even organs can be grown in a laboratory artificially, the brain has resisted attempts thus far. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(17)30116-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671117301169%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month reported a successful attempt to do exactly this. Researchers successfully turned &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/&quot;&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; into tiny cultures of brain cells with several cell types typical for the midbrain. This is a very important methodological development that will help to facilitate the study of both the healthy brain and various brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspirin does not benefit cognitive functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is one of the oldest drugs still in use. Surprisingly, new beneficial qualities of this simple molecule are still being discovered. With only small and manageable side effects, low-dose aspirin is even recommended as a daily drug for older healthy individuals, for reducing the risk of serious conditions such as cardiovascular problems. There were many reports suggesting that aspirin might also be useful for protection against dementia and cognitive decline. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.14883/abstract;jsessionid=1C755DC1975C6C3C275E050E53382E17.f04t01&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of existing data published this month found no evidence to support this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda drinking damages brain and accelerates its aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that sugary drinks are bad for general health is well known. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(17)30050-X/abstract&quot;&gt;New data&lt;/a&gt; based on a long-term study show that they are also damaging for brain functions. People consuming two or more sugary drinks at any time per day have poorer memory, decreased overall volume of the brain, and  a smaller hippocampus (a part of the brain associated with memory and learning). On the MRI scans their showed more prominent features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/25/exercise-and-brain-aging/&quot;&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; compared to people who don’t consume sugary beverages. Interestingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/48/5/1139&quot;&gt;switching to diet drinks&lt;/a&gt; containing artificial sweeteners doesn’t help much: people consuming at least one diet soda a day are three times more likely to develop dementia and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marmite: bad choice for brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marmite, a food spread popular in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, might be not as safe and healthy as usually assumed. A rather curious piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881117699613&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this month demonstrated that daily consumption of Marmite (one teaspoon every day) results in a 30% decrease in the brain response to visual stimuli. The effect is explained by the high content of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/07/30/vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-its-neurological-consequences/&quot;&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; in Marmite. This vitamin regulates the level of neurotransmitter GABA that has an inhibitory effect on the excitability of some neurons. The findings show that the food we eat may have substantial effects on our brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A link between cancer chemotherapy and depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always difficult to figure out if the depression that cancer patients often experience is caused by the psychological stress of having cancer, or also because of chemotherapy. New &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v7/n4/full/tp201768a.html&quot;&gt;research data&lt;/a&gt; obtained on healthy mice receiving drugs for brain cancer demonstrated that chemotherapy prevents formation of new cells in the hippocampus, a region of brain involved in memory formation and emotions. The treatment also resulted in the release of stress hormones and clear signs of depression. Brain cancer patients appear to be some of the most affected by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/&quot;&gt;treatment-related depression&lt;/a&gt;, which remains mostly undiagnosed. Understanding that depression might be related to treatment will help to develop therapies to counteract this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multitasking: few advantages, brain overloading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to multitask is often praised as a valuable skill, but does it really bring any advantages? New &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23591/abstract&quot;&gt;research data&lt;/a&gt; seriously questions the value of multitasking. Performing several tasks at the same task reduces productivity by 40%. Moreover, the findings show that frequent switching between tasks interferes with brain activity. Scientists also point out the danger of the continuous use of social media as it is an additional task for our brain and thus reduces the effectiveness of other tasks performed at the same time. It appears that focusing on a single task for a longer period of time brings better results than &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/19/neural-basis-of-multitasking/&quot;&gt;multitasking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How apps can support people to moderate their drinking</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/17/how-apps-can-support-people-to-moderate-their-drinking/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/16026889030_4453dd4ea7_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widespread use of smart phone applications, or ‘apps’, offers a unique opportunity for organizations to reach and engage with people in new ways in order to promote and support health-related behavior changes, including encouraging reductions in drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do they actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…of the 662 alcohol related apps available in the UK in 2014…just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977135&quot;&gt;91 (14%) focused on alcohol reduction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit of apps is that they can deliver evidence-based behavior change techniques and other content to users, targeting their behaviors when and where these are actually carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the 662 alcohol related apps available in the UK in 2014, 357 (54%) were entertainment apps (including drinking games, cocktail recipes and bar finders), 125 (19%) related to blood alcohol measurement, and just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977135&quot;&gt;91 (14%) focused on alcohol reduction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinkaware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Drinkaware launched &lt;em&gt;Drinkaware: Track and Calculate Units&lt;/em&gt; – a new app designed specifically to help people wanting to monitor and cut down on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, on Android and iOS, contains techniques that can help users to self-monitor the alcohol units and calories in their drinks and it provides them with information about the health benefits of cutting down. It also allows users to set their own individual goals and offers support and motivation through regular personalized feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the app that was evaluated in our study also contained a “weak spot” feature that allowed users to work towards breaking the habit of drinking in excess when they find themselves in self-designated “risky” locations for drinking (e.g. the local pub).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2015, the app was updated to include a cost tracking feature which allows users to add up the price of their drinks so they can be more aware of the consequences of cutting back that reach beyond their health alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the app has been downloaded more than 380,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4358-9&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; presents an analysis of the first 13 months of app usage based on data from 119,713 existing users and qualitative interviews with 21 users. The study presents novel insights into how real app users perceived this product, how they interacted with the features that it contained, and also explored what those who are downloading alcohol reduction apps are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who engaged for longer with the app tended to be high risk drinkers who reported being motivated to reduce drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of app usage found that there was a high level of drop out after one week and that users who engaged for longer with the app tended to be high risk drinkers who reported being motivated to reduce drinking. For those who consistently engaged with the app over time, self-reported alcohol consumption levels reduced in the first week of use and leveled out thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study found that the Drinkaware app is a useful tool for supporting behavior change in people who are already motivated and committed to reducing their alcohol consumption. However, the in-depth interviews suggested that the app would benefit from greater personalization and tailoring to promote longer term use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drinkaware team is now considering how these improvements can be implemented, while also exploring the app’s value as a tool for providing a one-off brief alcohol assessment and opportunities for the app to link to other lifestyle behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore how different apps may best help people with different support needs and personal preferences, assessing outcomes based on validated measures of alcohol consumption obtained independently of the app itself. Using routinely collected data offers an exciting opportunity for innovative research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing with others, helping people in need, consoling those who are distressed. All these behaviours can be encouraged by empathy – by understanding what other people are thinking and feeling, and sharing their emotions. Enhance empathy, especially in those who tend to have problems with it – like narcissists – and society as a whole might benefit. So how can it be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the cultivation of empathy is a “presumed benefit” of mindfulness training, note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2016.1269667&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/i&gt;, designed to investigate this experimentally. People who are “mindfully aware” focus on the present moment, without judgement. So, it’s been argued, they should be better able to resist getting caught up in their own thoughts, freeing them to think more about the mental states of other people. As mindfulness courses are increasingly being offered in schools and workplaces, as well as in mental health settings, it’s important to know what such training can and can’t achieve. The new results suggest it won’t foster empathy – and, worse, it could even backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24007&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Ridderinkhof, at the University of Amsterdam, and her colleagues divided 161 adult volunteers in three groups. Each completed questionnaires assessing their levels of narcissistic and also autistic traits. It’s already known that people who score highly on narcissism (who feel superior to others, believe they are entitled to privileges and want to be admired) tend to experience less “affective empathy”. They aren’t as likely to share the emotional state of another person. People who score highly on autistic traits have no problem with affective empathy, but tend to show impairments in “cognitive empathy”. They find it harder to work out what other people are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group spent five minutes in a guided mindfulness meditation, in which they were encouraged to focus on the physical sensations of breathing, while observing any thoughts, without judging them. The second group took part in a relaxation exercise (so any effects of stress relief alone could be examined). People in the control group were invited to let their minds wander, and to be immersed in their thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these exercises, the researchers tested the volunteers’ propensity to feel cognitive empathy, via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, which involves identifying emotions from photographs of people’s eyes, and they also tested their affective empathy, by analysing how much emotional concern they showed toward a player who was socially rejected in a ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some debate about whether a greater capacity for empathy would be helpful for most people. Some researchers, such as Professor Tania Singer, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, even suggest that an “excess” of empathy explains what’s often termed “burnout” in members of caring professions, such as nurses. But Ridderinkhof’s team predicted that mindfulness training would improve empathy in the volunteers who needed it most: in people with high levels of autistic or narcissistic traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t. While there was no overall effect on empathy in the mindfulness group, further analysis revealed that, compared with the control and relaxation groups combined, non-narcissists who completed the mindfulness exercise did show a slight improvement specifically in cognitive empathy, but for narcissistic people, their cognitive empathy was actually reduced. For the people who scored highly on autistic traits, meanwhile, there was no effect on mind-reading accuracy, though there were intriguing signs of greater prosocial behaviour, indicated by an increase in the number of passes of the ball to socially excluded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since volunteers were encouraged not to judge any thoughts they had during the mindfulness meditation, this might indeed have helped non-narcissists let go of self-critical thoughts, allowing them to think more about the mental states of others, the researchers suggest. “By contrast, it may have ironically ‘licensed’ narcissistic individuals to focus more exclusively on their self-aggrandising thoughts.” As a result, they may have thought even less about the mental states of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics may argue that a single five-minute mindfulness meditation exercise is simply not  enough, and that improvements in empathy – in non-narcissists, at least – might perhaps show up with longer sessions. While the research team thinks this is worth exploring, there is evidence from earlier studies (that lacked a proper control group) that five-minute sessions can increase accuracy on a mind-reading test, for example. It was reasonable to opt for a brief session in this study, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research might also investigate whether alternative approaches – perhaps training the related concept of “compassion” (which involves “feeling for” rather than “feeling with” a person in psychological pain, and is advocated by Singer) might help narcissists behave more pro-socially.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: PD-1 expression by tumour-associated macrophages inhibits phagocytosis and tumour immunity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/H-IjjFyMOu0/nature22396</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Tumour cells frequently overexpress the ligand for PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), facilitating their escape from the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, by binding to either the ligand or receptor, have shown notable clinical efficacy in patients with a variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Although it is well established that PD-1–PD-L1 blockade activates T cells, little is known about the role that this pathway may have in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here we show that both mouse and human TAMs express PD-1. TAM PD-1 expression increases over time in mouse models of cancer and with increasing disease stage in primary human cancers. TAM PD-1 expression correlates negatively with phagocytic potency against tumour cells, and blockade of PD-1–PD-L1 in vivo increases macrophage phagocytosis, reduces tumour growth and lengthens the survival of mice in mouse models of cancer in a macrophage-dependent fashion. This suggests that PD-1–PD-L1 therapies may also function through a direct effect on macrophages, with substantial implications for the treatment of cancer with these agents.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Human GLP-1 receptor transmembrane domain structure in complex with allosteric modulators</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kvP0Mh9qCO8/nature22378</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR) are members of the secretin-like class B family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and have opposing physiological roles in insulin release and glucose homeostasis. The treatment of type 2 diabetes requires positive modulation of GLP-1R to inhibit glucagon secretion and stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Here we report crystal structures of the human GLP-1R transmembrane domain in complex with two different negative allosteric modulators, PF-06372222 and NNC0640, at 2.7 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a common binding pocket for negative allosteric modulators, present in both GLP-1R and GCGR and located outside helices V–VII near the intracellular half of the receptor. The receptor is in an inactive conformation with compounds that restrict movement of the intracellular tip of helix VI, a movement that is generally associated with activation mechanisms in class A GPCRs. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis studies indicate that agonist positive allosteric modulators target the same general region, but in a distinct sub-pocket at the interface between helices V and VI, which may facilitate the formation of an intracellular binding site that enhances G-protein coupling.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: uORF-mediated translation allows engineered plant disease resistance without fitness costs</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/LuM_Gk44YhM/nature22372</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Controlling plant disease has been a struggle for humankind since the advent of agriculture. Studies of plant immune mechanisms have led to strategies of engineering resistant crops through ectopic transcription of plants’ own defence genes, such as the master immune regulatory gene NPR1 (ref. 1). However, enhanced resistance obtained through such strategies is often associated with substantial penalties to fitness, making the resulting products undesirable for agricultural applications. To remedy this problem, we sought more stringent mechanisms of expressing defence proteins. On the basis of our latest finding that translation of key immune regulators, such as TBF1 (ref. 3), is rapidly and transiently induced upon pathogen challenge (see accompanying paper), we developed a ‘TBF1-cassette’ consisting of not only the immune-inducible promoter but also two pathogen-responsive upstream open reading frames (uORFsTBF1) of the TBF1 gene. Here we demonstrate that inclusion of uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control over the production of snc1-1 (an autoactivated immune receptor) in Arabidopsis thaliana and AtNPR1 in rice enables us to engineer broad-spectrum disease resistance without compromising plant fitness in the laboratory or in the field. This broadly applicable strategy may lead to decreased pesticide use and reduce the selective pressure for resistant pathogens.

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/m8krf37mur0/nature22371</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In the absence of specialized immune cells, the need for plants to reprogram transcription to transition from growth-related activities to defence is well understood. However, little is known about translational changes that occur during immune induction. Using ribosome footprinting, here we perform global translatome profiling on Arabidopsis exposed to the microbe-associated molecular pattern elf18. We find that during this pattern-triggered immunity, translation is tightly regulated and poorly correlated with transcription. Identification of genes with altered translational efficiency leads to the discovery of novel regulators of this immune response. Further investigation of these genes shows that messenger RNA sequence features are major determinants of the observed translational efficiency changes. In the 5′ leader sequences of transcripts with increased translational efficiency, we find a highly enriched messenger RNA consensus sequence, R-motif, consisting of mostly purines. We show that R-motif regulates translation in response to pattern-triggered immunity induction through interaction with poly(A)-binding proteins. Therefore, this study provides not only strong evidence, but also a molecular mechanism, for global translational reprogramming during pattern-triggered immunity in plants.

 A variety of tissue lineages can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells by mimicking embryonic development through stepwise exposure to morphogens, or by conversion of one differentiated cell type into another by enforced expression of master transcription factors. Here, to yield functional human haematopoietic stem cells, we perform morphogen-directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into haemogenic endothelium followed by screening of 26 candidate haematopoietic stem-cell-specifying transcription factors for their capacity to promote multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment in mouse hosts. We recover seven transcription factors (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1 and SPI1) that are sufficient to convert haemogenic endothelium into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that engraft myeloid, B and T cells in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Our combined approach of morphogen-driven differentiation and transcription-factor-mediated cell fate conversion produces haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from pluripotent stem cells and holds promise for modelling haematopoietic disease in humanized mice and for therapeutic strategies in genetic blood disorders.

 Tumour-specific CD8 T cells in solid tumours are dysfunctional, allowing tumours to progress. The epigenetic regulation of T cell dysfunction and therapeutic reprogrammability (for example, to immune checkpoint blockade) is not well understood. Here we show that T cells in mouse tumours differentiate through two discrete chromatin states: a plastic dysfunctional state from which T cells can be rescued, and a fixed dysfunctional state in which the cells are resistant to reprogramming. We identified surface markers associated with each chromatin state that distinguished reprogrammable from non-reprogrammable PD1hi dysfunctional T cells within heterogeneous T cell populations from tumours in mice; these surface markers were also expressed on human PD1hi tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Our study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as we define key transcription factors and epigenetic programs underlying T cell dysfunction and surface markers that predict therapeutic reprogrammability.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein–protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification–mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Evolutionary enhancement of Zika virus infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Zika virus (ZIKV) remained obscure until the recent explosive outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and South America (2015–2016). Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas. However, the underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly and explosively spread from Asia to the Americas are unclear. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and subsequently enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes. Here we show that NS1 antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical isolates from the most recent outbreak in the Americas were much more infectious in mosquitoes than the FSS13025 strain, which was isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed that these epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 strain because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at residue 188 in NS1. ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino acid substitution in the ZIKV FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results reveal that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 protein, resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structure of the full-length glucagon class B G-protein-coupled receptor</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8ntyJ1LZDyg/nature22363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The human glucagon receptor, GCGR, belongs to the class B G-protein-coupled receptor family and plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Here we report the 3.0 Å crystal structure of full-length GCGR containing both the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain in an inactive conformation. The two domains are connected by a 12-residue segment termed the stalk, which adopts a β-strand conformation, instead of forming an α-helix as observed in the previously solved structure of the GCGR transmembrane domain. The first extracellular loop exhibits a β-hairpin conformation and interacts with the stalk to form a compact β-sheet structure. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange, disulfide crosslinking and molecular dynamics studies suggest that the stalk and the first extracellular loop have critical roles in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation. These insights into the full-length GCGR structure deepen our understanding of the signalling mechanisms of class B G-protein-coupled receptors.

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mTG3AjjBNyg/nature22350</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 In humans and other mammalian species, lesions in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus cause profound sleep impairment, indicating a crucial role of the preoptic area in sleep generation. However, the underlying circuit mechanism remains poorly understood. Electrophysiological recordings and c-Fos immunohistochemistry have shown the existence of sleep-active neurons in the preoptic area, especially in the ventrolateral preoptic area and median preoptic nucleus. Pharmacogenetic activation of c-Fos-labelled sleep-active neurons has been shown to induce sleep. However, the sleep-active neurons are spatially intermingled with wake-active neurons, making it difficult to target the sleep neurons specifically for circuit analysis. Here we identify a population of preoptic area sleep neurons on the basis of their projection target and discover their molecular markers. Using a lentivirus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or a light-activated chloride channel for retrograde labelling, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation, and optrode recording, we show that the preoptic area GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus are both sleep active and sleep promoting. Furthermore, translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing identify candidate markers for these neurons, and optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations demonstrate that several peptide markers (cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and tachykinin 1) label sleep-promoting neurons. Together, these findings provide easy genetic access to sleep-promoting preoptic area neurons and a valuable entry point for dissecting the sleep control circuit.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coordination in groups faces a sub-optimization problem and theory suggests that some randomness may help to achieve global optima. Here we performed experiments involving a networked colour coordination game in which groups of humans interacted with autonomous software agents (known as bots). Subjects (n = 4,000) were embedded in networks (n = 230) of 20 nodes, to which we sometimes added 3 bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioural randomness and different geodesic locations. We show that bots acting with small levels of random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6%. This is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioural randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were connected easier, but also by affecting the gameplay of the humans among themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination in these heterogeneous systems.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Conversion of adult endothelium to immunocompetent haematopoietic stem cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/EPZFZnjDVqU/nature22326</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The induction phase (days 0–8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During the specification phase (days 8–20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase of rEC-HSCs (days 20–28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition of TGFβ and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation of rEC-HSCs. Pluripotency-independent conversion of endothelial cells into autologous authentic engraftable haematopoietic stem cells could aid treatment of haematological disorders.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cancer progression by reprogrammed BCAA metabolism in myeloid leukaemia</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/IF60TcUsLsw/nature22314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Reprogrammed cellular metabolism is a common characteristic observed in various cancers. However, whether metabolic changes directly regulate cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. Here we show that BCAT1, a cytosolic aminotransferase for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is aberrantly activated and functionally required for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans and in mouse models of CML. BCAT1 is upregulated during progression of CML and promotes BCAA production in leukaemia cells by aminating the branched-chain keto acids. Blocking BCAT1 gene expression or enzymatic activity induces cellular differentiation and impairs the propagation of blast crisis CML both in vitro and in vivo. Stable-isotope tracer experiments combined with nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analysis demonstrate the intracellular production of BCAAs by BCAT1. Direct supplementation with BCAAs ameliorates the defects caused by BCAT1 knockdown, indicating that BCAT1 exerts its oncogenic function through BCAA production in blast crisis CML cells. Importantly, BCAT1 expression not only is activated in human blast crisis CML and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia, but also predicts disease outcome in patients. As an upstream regulator of BCAT1 expression, we identified Musashi2 (MSI2), an oncogenic RNA binding protein that is required for blast crisis CML. MSI2 is physically associated with the BCAT1 transcript and positively regulates its protein expression in leukaemia. Taken together, this work reveals that altered BCAA metabolism activated through the MSI2–BCAT1 axis drives cancer progression in myeloid leukaemia.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Does High Testosterone Mean Low Empathy?</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/16/high-testosterone-and-low-empathy/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is defined as the ability to understand the feelings, emotions, and perspective of another person.  Empathy is critical for healthy social interactions, and impairments in empathy contribute to disorders of social interaction such as autism and psychopathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women score higher on tests of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/26/do-insects-have-emotions-and-empathy/&quot;&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt; than men, leading researchers to examine a potential role for the male sex hormone testosterone in controlling empathy.  However, more recent studies have begun to explore the “dual hormone” hypothesis, that posits that testosterone interacts with the stress hormone cortisol to regulate social behaviours such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2010 study by Jack van Honk and colleagues investigated the effects of acute testosterone administration on cognitive empathy in female volunteers. The study participants were administered either a placebo or a 0.5 mg dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/10/08/testosterone-and-fatherhood-the-biology-of-building-a-family/&quot;&gt;testosterone &lt;/a&gt;under the tongue, after which they took a test called, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET).  This test measures how well an individual can interpret another’s emotions by reading expressions in the eye area of the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants took the test twice – once following administration of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/07/is-placebo-more-powerful-than-antidepressants-and-psychotherapy/&quot;&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, and once after testosterone treatment – to assess how testosterone affected each subject individually.  Overall, the testosterone treatment reduced women’s scores on the RMET, suggesting that it impaired their ability to “read” the emotions and intentions of others through facial expressions in the eye area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers went one step further and measured the 2D:4D ratio of the study participants. This measure indicates the ratio in length between the index finger (second digit) and ring finger (fourth digit) and is considered a proxy measure of prenatal testosterone exposure.  Men have lower 2D:4D ratios than women, and women exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb display masculinized (lower) digit ratios. Elevated levels of foetal testosterone can occur in diseases such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome, and women with these disorders display reduced digit ratios. However, lower 2D:4D ratios are also found in otherwise healthy women due to individual variations in foetal hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Honk &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. found that the RMET score reduction in response to testosterone was strongly correlated with the digit ratio, and that women with lower ratios (who thus had higher prenatal testosterone exposure) had stronger responses to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt;.  These findings suggest an interesting “priming” effect of male hormone exposure during development that makes the brain more responsive to testosterone in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings provide support for the controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/29/sex-bias-in-autism-spectrum-disorders-is-it-real/&quot;&gt;‘extreme male brain’ theory&lt;/a&gt; of autism, a disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviours. This theory posits that autism represents an extreme version of the normal male brain profile that is characterized by an increased systematizing ability and a reduced empathizing ability in comparison to females. The pathological impairment of empathy in autism may therefore arise from excessive “male” hormone levels during development.  Accordingly, reduced 2D:4D ratios have been observed in autistic individuals and in their first-degree relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this and other studies have demonstrated a clear inhibitory effect of testosterone on cognitive empathy, they tell only one part of the story. Other hormones may also play a role in the regulation of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such hormone is cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/&quot;&gt;Cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and testosterone form the key players in the “dual-hormone hypothesis,” that seeks to explain how empathy, aggression, dominance, and other social behaviours are controlled by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by Zilioli &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. examined whether the levels of testosterone and cortisol in the blood were associated with empathy in a group of university students. The students took a series of tests that included the RMET as well as the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a questionnaire designed to measure different aspects of empathy.  Saliva was collected for the analysis of cortisol and testosterone, and associations between hormone levels and RMET and IRI scores were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, testosterone levels were higher in men, and women scored higher on tests of empathy.  In women, there were no associations between hormone levels and empathy scores. However, an interesting association emerged between testosterone, cortisol and empathy in men, where an interaction between testosterone and cortisol was detected in relation to men’s IRI scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men with higher than average &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/08/how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-examine-my-brain/&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; levels, low cortisol predicted low empathy scores, whereas high cortisol predicted high empathy scores.  This association was not observed for men with testosterone levels below the mean, in whom cortisol showed no association with empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, a similar pattern emerged when they were grouped according to testosterone levels: women with low cortisol and high testosterone had reduced empathy scores.  However, these differences did not meet the cut-off for statistical significance, probably due to the smaller number of women than men in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high testosterone, low cortisol profile has been linked with competitiveness and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/02/19/human-aggression-and-violence-a-necessary-evil/&quot;&gt;aggressive behaviour&lt;/a&gt;.  This profile has also been associated with psychopathy, a mental condition defined by anti-sociality, egotism, and impaired empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men with high testosterone levels and high cortisol in this study displayed increased empathy.  What are the implications for real life behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that this profile could underlie certain altruistic behaviours such as acts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/23/kids-are-not-naturally-nice-parents-shape-future-heroes/&quot;&gt;heroism&lt;/a&gt; where public safety is concerned.  They also posit that elevated cortisol levels might replicate a state of mild internal stress, which might be helpful for turning on feelings of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
