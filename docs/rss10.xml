	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Annals of Surgery has retracted two papers it never intended to publish. According to journal’s editor, Keith Lillemoe, the papers—published in 2015, two months apart—had undergone full peer review and were rejected, “like 90% of submissions to our journal:” The decision was clear and the authors were notified.

	<title>BMC Series blog: Possible effects of raising tobacco taxes across the EU</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/21/possible-effects-of-raising-tobacco-taxes-across-the-eu/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/non-smoking-2367409_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European Union (EU), approximately 700,000 people die of smoking-related diseases every year. The reduction of tobacco consumption has thus become one of the major social policies of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tobacco control policies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/en/&quot;&gt;MPOWER&lt;/a&gt;) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008 serve as a guideline for the health authorities of the EU member states. The six MPOWER measures mandate (i) increases in the tobacco tax; (ii) monitoring of tobacco usage; (iii) support for quitters; (iv) creation of a smoking-free environment; (v) warning against the dangers of tobacco; (vi) and banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the MPOWER measures, taxation is the most common single policy tool to control tobacco use. Economic theory suggests that increasing tobacco taxes will result in higher direct costs for smokers and thus lower consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the tobacco industry could absorb the additional costs to prevent higher retail prices, but, in reality, increased costs are passed on to the consumers. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that most consumers, when confronted with higher retail prices, indeed reduce consumption, while others switch to lower-priced products or turn to smuggled goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling a 10% tax increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we estimated the effects of a hypothetical cigarette price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and death toll of smoking in 28 EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous studies, our statistical model also accounted for the fact that income affects the responsiveness of consumers to price changes. Research has shown that smokers with high disposable income are less affected by rising cigarette prices than those with lower income. In other words, the price elasticity of demand changes with income (income threshold effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price elasticity of demand is used to measure changes in demand of goods in response to changes in price. It gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our statistical model separates the observed 28 countries into three income clusters (regimes), assuming that all of the countries within a cluster have about the same response patterns to price increases. Using data for the years 2005 to 2014, our model estimated the price elasticity of each income cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the elasticity figures, we were able to estimate the possible effects of a hypothetical price increase of 10% on consumption, tax revenues and the number of averted smoking-attributable deaths. The latter figure derived from the simulated impact of price increments on the reduction in smokers and was adjusted for the fact that smoking cessation still carries considerable risks of early death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of our study revealed that higher taxation would be considerably more effective in reducing consumption as well as incidences of smoking-related deaths in the two less developed regimes than in the remaining 24 countries (EU24) belonging to the third income regime. Specifically, nicotine use would be reduced by 12.27% in Bulgaria and Romania; by 8.29% in Latvia and Poland; and by 5.03% in the EU24 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other measures, such as bans on tobacco advertising, taxation not only effectively decreases tobacco consumption but, in general, also has the beneficial side effect of increasing national tax revenues. Our simulation showed that although tax revenues increased by 7.03% in Latvia and Poland, and by 3.15% in the EU24 area, revenues dropped by 1.41% in the least developed countries, Bulgaria and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different policies for different countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the policy implications? As the results of the study show, there are three income regimes among the observed 28 European countries. Since each regime is differently affected by cigarette taxation, different policies must be adopted to fight nicotine use. Specifically, other measures to control tobacco use, such as restrictions on advertisements, pictorial warning labels and cessation assistance, are necessary in high-income countries to compensate for the income threshold effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as the study has shown, higher taxation leads to significant increases in tax revenues in high-income regimes, but in poorer countries it is more likely to lead to considerable losses in tax revenues. Health authorities in less developed countries may thus lack crucial funding to implement anti-smoking measures. External funding (donations from other European countries) would thus be required to ensure success in combating cigarette use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illicit trade of tobacco products has not been included in the study, as reliable data could not be obtained for all countries. Moreover, data on cigarette consumption analysed in this study refer to factory-made (FM) cigarettes. Roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco products have become popular in the EU in recent years and may influence consumption behavior. Further research on price effects may thus address the issue of illicit trade and RYO cigarette use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia complains of serious memory problems, sometimes even forgetting who they are, without there being any apparent physical reason for their symptoms – in other words, their condition seems to be purely psychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating, controversial diagnosis with roots dating back to Freud’s, Breuer’s and Charcot’s ideas about hysteria and how emotional problems sometimes manifest in dramatic physical ways. Today, some experts doubt that psychogenic amnesia is a real phenomenon, reasoning that there is either an undetected physical cause or the patient is fabricating their memory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/9/2498/4080831/Psychogenic-amnesia-syndromes-outcome-and-patterns&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, a team of British neuropsychologists has reported their findings from a study of 53 patients diagnosed with psychogenic amnesia – one of the largest ever studies of its kind. Michael Kopelman at Kings College, London, and his colleagues conclude that the prognosis (that is, the scope and speed of recovery) for psychogenic amnesia is better than previously realised and that there appear to be four main categories of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30107&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients with psychogenic amnesia were all patients at St Thomas’s Hospital in London between 1990 and 2008, and the researchers compared their memory functioning and clinical history with 21 patients with memory disorders with a known physical cause (such as early stage Alzheimer’s or hypoxia), and 14 healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients with psychogenic amnesia fell into four distinct categories. There were those who were in a &lt;strong&gt;fugue state&lt;/strong&gt;, who had been wandering lost for days with no recollection of who they are or their past life. “I had a breakdown,” said one patient. “My brain decided to close down. I felt as if placed into a grown-up body without knowing the history of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon neurological examination, the fugue patients appeared healthy, and their state usually returned to normal within four weeks, though usually sooner, and sometimes within hours. After recovery, most of their memories returned, except for a blank gap during the fugue state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second category was &lt;strong&gt;fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia&lt;/strong&gt;. These patients started out in a fugue state – lost and usually with no or little memory of their past and no sense of identity – then as the fugue state resolved, they were left with more persistent memory loss for large periods of their past lives. Their memory gaps seemed to take longer to recover than the fugue patients (sometimes never recovering), though with a relative sparing of more recent memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third category was &lt;strong&gt;focal retrograde amnesia&lt;/strong&gt;. These patients had a severe loss of memory for large periods of their lives, or their entire lives, sometimes a temporary loss of identity, but there was no fugue period involving wandering. The onset was often a mild neurological event (such as a minor stroke) or minor head injury, but one “insufficient to account for the severity of the retrograde memory loss”. Similar to the fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia category, these patients’ memory loss was more prolonged than the fugue patients, but with a relative sparing of more recent memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, some of the patients fell into a category the researchers called “&lt;strong&gt;gaps in memory&lt;/strong&gt;” – they didn’t have a wandering period, loss of personal identity was also rare, and their one or more periods of memory loss were discrete, often tied to a specific traumatic experience (and often associated with PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At six months follow up, the fugue patients and to a lesser extent, the focal retrograde amnesia patients, showed good improvement. “In summary, the prognosis in psychogenic amnesia appears better than the previous literature suggests,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the psychogenic patients with the neurological and healthy controls, the psychogenic group were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to have suffered a past head injury (though not of sufficient seriousness to explain their memory problems); they were more likely to have a diagnosis of depression; to have a history of family or relationship problems, or employment problems; problems in childhood; and/or a history of alcohol or drug problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding that the psychogenic patients were more likely to have a history of head injury than the neurological controls is particularly surprising. Kopelman’s team said “this may predispose some individuals to developing psychogenic amnesia at a later time of severe precipitating crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A debate about psychogenic amnesia that dates back to Freud is whether the process of memory loss is deliberate or subconscious. Kopelman and his team observed that their findings were more consistent with there being a conscious, deliberate element to the condition (as first proposed by Freud and Josef Breuer, though Freud later changed his position). For instance, some of the patients in the new study made comments like: “It’s like a box locked away, and I don’t really want to open it” and “I put things in boxes … I know the memories are there … but cannot get access to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current thinking of Kopelman and others is that the deliberate memory suppression of psychogenic amnesia is often brought about by stressful crises in life, and that the deliberate forgetting manifests in genuine neurological processes that really do interfere with memory and even personal identity. Kopelman and his team conclude by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045208/&quot;&gt;quoting&lt;/a&gt; the Cambridge University psychologists Michael Anderson and Simon Hanslmayr: “Control mechanisms mediated by the prefrontal cortex interrupt mnemonic function and impair memory … We are … conspirators in our own forgetting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/9/2498/4080831/Psychogenic-amnesia-syndromes-outcome-and-patterns&quot;&gt;Psychogenic amnesia: syndromes, outcome, and patterns of retrograde amnesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Founded in May 2017 by Clifford Woolf, Professor of Neurology and Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, Kevin Eggan, Professor of Regenerative Biology at Harvard, Kasper Roet, Harvard Research Fellow, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/q-state-biosciences&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Q-State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Biosciences, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/quralis-corporation/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;QurAlis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; focuses the power of Q-State’s powerful, 100% optical electrophysiology platform on novel, stem cell-derived, disease-in-dish models of ALS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It’s a Dead Sea microorganism that is the basis of the enabling Q-State technology. QuasAr proteins, derived from this microbe, respond to action potentials and synaptic signals by emitting near-infrared fluorescence. These Optopatch assays thus deliver higher throughput and information content than traditional patch clamp assays, and they also provide better resolution and lower phototoxicity than other optical screening tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Known around the world as a leader in cardiovascular science and biomedical engineering, Dr. Igor Efimov and his team developed a method for optically mapping organotypic cultures of donor human heart slices, enabling users to test the cardiac safety and efficacy of therapeutic candidates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The culture method preserves heart tissue architecture and extracellular matrix — aspects of heart health that cannot be revealed by iPSC-derived cardiac cells or other traditional assays for cardiovascular toxicology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/efimov-lab-department-of-biomedical-engineering&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Visit the lab’s storefront &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;for a list of their recent exciting publications — this is clearly a team to watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic’s robotic cloud lab paradigm means biologists can be running experiments on the other side of the planet from their lab, leveraging a bank of robotic workcells for massive experimentation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; frees researchers to focus on the creative aspects of their science by providing faster, more reliable and repeatable processes with vastly lower capital costs than previously possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differentiators: Transparency, flexibility, multiplex-ity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1134&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Transcriptic-Robotic-Workcell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Transcriptic Robotic Workcell&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1134&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Transcriptic-Robotic-Workcell-300x192.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Multiple integrated automated devices per workcell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No other service provider on the planet can tell you exactly how they run an experiment on the user’s behalf. Transcriptic provides deep transparency into how users’ experiments were run by executing experiments exactly as specified and also providing retrospective diagnostic data on individual instrument performance during the experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible robotics: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Being a robotic cloud lab, the Transcriptic system can dynamically provision robotic resources to process samples for users. For example, the system might start the week at a scale of one plate and end the week on hundreds of plates. Users only pay for the resources they use, reaping the reproducibility and throughput benefits of robotics without any of the overhead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy multiplexing: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Transcriptic web application makes it easy as checking a box to detect an additional analyte in your sample. When it’s that easy, you can perform multiplexed quantiation of more analytes, starting to generate a more accurate picture of the phenotypic state of your sample.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Featured Service: Mesocale Discovery (MSD) Assay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MSD assay, validated in many bioanalytical methods per U.S. FDA and EMA guidances, is offered as a service by Transcriptic. The Mesoscale Discovery Sector S 600 instrument is fully integrated with the Transcriptic robotic cloud lab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The MSD S 600 instrument performs multiplexed detection of up to 10 analytes per well, ensuring the highest data-to-sample quantity efficiency, in immunoassays. Multiple assay panels are available from the V-Plex line, all conducted with complete automated precision by robots in the cloud. Custom panel assays are also available through the MSD U-Plex system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why requesters choose Transcriptic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic, in collaboration with multiple biopharma companies and non-academic laboratories, has delivered many peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transcriptic presented one interesting study at SynBioBeta 2016. In collaboration with EpiBiome, Transcriptic’s automated platform provided a robust, reproducible and high-throughput method for on-demand microbiome characterization. This workflow captured sample prep through NGS and sequencing analysis in 7-10 days, allowing for fast, iterative cycles of microbiome screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: Breaking memory circuits with marijuana</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/GhJUqw4RZoM/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PotBrain-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranoia. Munchies. Giggles. Sleepiness. Memory loss. Although the effects of cannabinoids–the active components of marijuana–are familiar to many, their neurobiological substrates are poorly characterized. Perhaps the effect of greatest interest to both neuroscientists and to cannabis users hoping to preserve their cognitive function, is short-term memory impairment that often accompanies marijuana use. Our partial understanding of its physiological and behavioral effects is not for want of studies into its neural effects. Ample research has shown a range of changes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481526/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurotransmission, receptors, ion channels and mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; following cannabinoid exposure. However, knowledge of its cellular and molecular properties alone cannot offer a complete picture of its system-wide effects leading to cognitive and behavioral changes. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005624&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; took a novel approach to address this issue, combining computational modeling with electrophysiological brain recordings from rats performing a memory task, to unravel the dynamics of neural circuits under the influence of cannabinoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis impairs memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess memory changes induced by cannabinoids, the scientists injected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, into rats before they performed a “delayed-nonmatch-to-sample” working memory task. In this task, rats are cued with one of two levers, and after a delay, are required to select the opposite lever. Compared to sober sessions, performance under THC was impaired by 12%, confirming the all-too-familiar memory impairment associated with cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC alters hippocampal activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-19447&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/CajalHippocampus_modified-300x163.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The researchers focused on the hippocampus, a brain region essential for forming new memories, to examine how THC alters neural function underlying these memory deficits. The hippocampus has a characteristic circuit through three main subregions, whereby signal projects from the dentate gyrus to CA3 (via mossy fibers), and from CA3 to CA1 (via Schaffer collaterals). Although THC did not alter the mean firing rate in either CA3 or CA1, the researchers discovered more nuanced drug effects within hippocampal subregions. Neurons in the hippocampus are known to demonstrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18284371&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selectivity for particular stimuli&lt;/a&gt;, and in this task, some neurons responded preferentially to lever presentations. After THC administration, this selectivity to lever presentation was reduced, suggesting that THC lowers information coding by the hippocampus. Further, theta power in CA1 was also reduced after THC administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC breaks the memory circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these preliminary results validate prior findings that cannabinoids disrupt traditional properties of neural activity, they do not speak to how THC modifies network-level signaling subserving memory. To probe functional circuitry, the researchers modeled intracellular and extracellular processes–such as refractory periods, potassium conductance or recurrent connections–contributing to CA3 to CA1 signaling. Memory deficits from THC correlated with both reduced feedforward excitation, and increased feedback excitation, along the CA3 to CA1 pathway. Modeling dynamic filters of this circuit, they further discovered that THC-induced memory impairments correlated with less feedforward theta and greater feedback theta-blocking from CA1. THC also reduced the number of CA3-CA1 connections, together suggesting that THC functionally isolates neurons from the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 subregions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed a clear disruption by THC in the hippocampal circuitry supporting memory, though it didn’t directly examine what &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; this functional breakdown. The brain possesses its own endocannabinoid system, which includes several cannabinoid receptors and endogenous endocannabinoids, which act on these receptors. In the drug-free brain, this system is involved in regulating functions such as mood, sleep, appetite, and of course, memory. Follow-up research will be necessary to clarify exactly how exogenous cannabinoids like THC wreak havoc on this system, but the authors speculate that THC may reduce feedforward excitation by activating CA3 CB1 receptors and reducing glutamate release, and increase feedback excitation by reducing CA1 interneuron output. Importantly, the authors emphasize, effects of cannabinoids on neural function aren’t one-size-fits-all. It’s likely that the brain’s excitation/inhibition balance depends on THC dose, leading to unique functional and behavioral changes under distinct drug conditions. Such differences in neural signaling dynamics, determined by drug dose and the targeted brain circuitry, could explain inconsistent reports of cannabinoids on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22019959&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pro- and anti-convulsant activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study helps to fill a critical gap in our understanding, between the microscopic cellular and macroscopic whole-brain levels, of the ways in which cannabis impairs memory. The authors stress that “&lt;em&gt;in order to truly understand the effects of THC, one must study the systems level changes in circuit dynamics rather than taking a reductionist approach and studying the effects of THC on any particular receptor or cell type&lt;/em&gt;.” By adopting the novel approach of modeling causal network dynamics, their research points to the breakdown of information flow along the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway as a major route of THC-induced memory disruption. As the researchers explain, their work “&lt;em&gt;is the first which examines the effect of THC on neuronal systems dynamics, or the causal interactions between signals, rather than on neuronal signals themselves&lt;/em&gt;.” More research examining causal brain circuitry will eventually lead to a more complete understanding of the diverse ways in which cannabinoids alter behavior and cognitive function, from causing memory loss and sleepiness to giggles and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believed the copious alarmist commentary in the newspapers, you’d fear for the future of our species. Today’s children, we’re told, are more hyperactive and technology addicted than ever before. They’ve lost any ability to sit still, instead craving constant stimulation from digital devices and exhausted parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might this mean for their performance on the most famous psychological measure of childhood self-control, Walter Mischel’s Marshmallow Test? Surely, kids of today will struggle far more than previous generations to resist the lure of one marshmallow (or other treat) now for the promise of two in ten minutes or so, as the task requires? In a new survey, the majority of child development experts certainly believed so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet based on his analysis of 50 years worth of performance data on the Marshmallow Test – &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/jghdm/&quot;&gt;released as a preprint at the Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt; – John Protzko at the University of California, Santa Barbara, concludes that in fact children of today are capable of more self-restraint than previous generations, with their ability to delay gratification having increased by about a minute per decade over the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30244&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko combined the results from every published and unpublished use of the Marshmallow Test that he could find, starting with Mischel’s seminal work first published in 1968 and including 4 studies in the 1970s, 3 in the 1990s, 6 in the 2000s, and 16 in our current decade, all involving children aged ten or younger. Protzko speculates that the gap in the 1980s is due to the introduction at that time of a rival test of self-regulation which is quicker to administer – the so-called gift-delay task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before crunching the numbers, Protzko polled 260 members of the Cognitive Development Society Listserv about how they thought the results would come out. Just over 50 per cent predicted that Protzko would find children’s powers of self-restraint would be lower today than the in past; 20 per cent predicted no change over time; and just 16 per cent believed that children today would outperform the children of the past (the others said there wouldn’t be enough data to answer the question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko found a statistically significant linear trend – children’s ability to resist immediate temptation and wait for a greater reward seems to have increased over the decades (this remained true when removing two study outliers, marked as black circles in the graph above). The increase in delay of gratification ability is similar in size to the known increase in average IQ seen over the same timescale, possibly reflecting shared mechanisms, though this is speculation at this stage. Meanwhile, variation in Marshmallow Test performance has stayed the same over the decades, which means that average improvement has been seen across the spread of ability, not just among those children who are more self-restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could the experts have got it so wrong? Protzko’s suggests they are prone to same bias as the rest of us, what he calls the “kids these days” phenomenon: “people’s memories for their own and others’ abilities in childhood are unduly influenced by their current abilities. While it is easy to look at kids these days and deride their inability to control themselves and decry the downfall of civilisation, it is much harder to accurately recall our own selves as children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the apparent improvement in children’s powers of self-control bode well for the future, for instance in terms of reduced criminality and addiction? Protzko thinks not, speculating that it is probably one’s ability relative to others, rather than one’s absolute ability, that is relevant to future behaviour – the lowest performers will remain at risk, he suggests. “These [unhealthy and dangerous] behaviours have been with humans for thousands of years, and will be with us for thousands more,” he predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes and consequences of the apparent increase in children’s powers of self-restraint over time remain to be uncovered by future research. For now, Protzko says the data show that “Contrary to historical and present complaints, kids these days appear to be better than we were. A supposed modern culture of instant gratification has not stemmed the march of improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The RNA-guided CRISPR–Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been widely repurposed for genome editing1–4. High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further improve fidelity are unknown5–9. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state10 when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we designed a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Temporal coexistence mechanisms contribute to the latitudinal gradient in forest diversity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/e5eNhehHuPk/nature24038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more tree species diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia combined. Biologists have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity. Latitudinal variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in ecological and evolutionary processes, and evidence increasingly shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and clade dispersal. However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Genome editing reveals a role for OCT4 in human embryogenesis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             Despite their fundamental biological and clinical importance, the molecular
                mechanisms that regulate the first cell fate decisions in the human embryo are not
                well understood. Here we use CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing to
                investigate the function of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 during human
                embryogenesis. We identified an efficient OCT4-targeting guide RNA using an
                inducible human embryonic stem cell-based system and microinjection of mouse
                zygotes. Using these refined methods, we efficiently and specifically targeted the
                gene encoding OCT4 (POU5F1) in diploid human zygotes and found that
                blastocyst development was compromised. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that, in
                    POU5F1-null cells, gene expression was downregulated not only for

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Regulation of DNA repair pathway choice in S and G2 phases by the NHEJ inhibitor CYREN</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/yrj4PHTGegg/nature24023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and homologous recombination compete for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks during the cell cycle. Homologous recombination is inhibited during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both pathways are active in the S and G2 phases. However, it is unclear why cNHEJ does not always outcompete homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases. Here we show that CYREN (cell cycle regulator of NHEJ) is a cell-cycle-specific inhibitor of cNHEJ. Suppression of CYREN allows cNHEJ to occur at telomeres and intrachromosomal breaks during the S and G2 phases, and cells lacking CYREN accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside the G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose that CYREN is a direct cell-cycle-dependent inhibitor of cNHEJ that promotes error-free repair by homologous recombination during cell cycle phases when sister chromatids are present.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             The characterization of mutational processes that generate sequence diversity in the
                human genome is of paramount importance both to medical genetics
                and to evolutionary studies. To understand how the age and sex of
                transmitting parents affect de novo mutations, here we sequence 1,548
                Icelanders, their parents, and, for a subset of 225, at least one child, to
                35× genome-wide coverage. We find 108,778 de novo mutations, both
                single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels, and determine the parent of origin of
                42,961. The number of de novo mutations from mothers increases by 0.37 per
                year of age (95% CI 0.32–0.43), a quarter of the 1.51 per year from fathers
                (95% CI 1.45–1.57). The number of clustered mutations increases faster with
                the mother’s age than with the father’s, and the genomic span of
                maternal de novo mutation clusters is greater than that of paternal ones. The
                types of de novo mutation from mothers change substantially with age, with a
                0.26% (95% CI 0.19–0.33%) decrease in
                cytosine–phosphate–guanine to
                thymine–phosphate–guanine (CpG&amp;gt;TpG) de novo mutations and
                a 0.33% (95% CI 0.28–0.38%) increase in C&amp;gt;G de novo mutations per
                year, respectively. Remarkably, these age-related changes are not distributed
                uniformly across the genome. A striking example is a 20 megabase region on
                chromosome 8p, with a maternal C&amp;gt;G mutation rate that is up to 50-fold greater
                than the rest of the genome. The age-related accumulation of maternal non-crossover
                gene conversions also mostly occurs within these regions. Increased sequence
                diversity and linkage disequilibrium of C&amp;gt;G variants within regions affected by
                excess maternal mutations indicate that the underlying mutational process has
                persisted in humans for thousands of years. Moreover, the regional excess of C&amp;gt;G
                variation in humans is largely shared by chimpanzees, less by gorillas, and is
                almost absent from orangutans. This demonstrates that sequence diversity in humans
                results from evolving interactions between age, sex, mutation type, and genomic
                location.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: ApoE4 markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/cQa8z9TYme0/nature24016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other ApoE isoforms. However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on either a human ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we show that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by three months of age compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age, P301S mice with different ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia results in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with the lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage and death compared with the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive for amyloid-β pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease who usually have tau pathology, ε4-carriers demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts a ‘toxic’ gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is protective.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Comparative glycoproteomics of stem cells identifies new players in ricin toxicity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/K8KhmkbfA2g/nature24015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Glycosylation, the covalent attachment of carbohydrate structures onto proteins, is the most abundant post-translational modification. Over 50% of human proteins are glycosylated, which alters their activities in diverse fundamental biological processes. Despite the importance of glycosylation in biology, the identification and functional validation of complex glycoproteins has remained largely unexplored. Here we develop a novel quantitative approach to identify intact glycopeptides from comparative proteomic data sets, allowing us not only to infer complex glycan structures but also to directly map them to sites within the associated proteins at the proteome scale. We apply this method to human and mouse embryonic stem cells to illuminate the stem cell glycoproteome. This analysis nearly doubles the number of experimentally confirmed glycoproteins, identifies previously unknown glycosylation sites and multiple glycosylated stemness factors, and uncovers evolutionarily conserved as well as species-specific glycoproteins in embryonic stem cells. The specificity of our method is confirmed using sister stem cells carrying repairable mutations in enzymes required for fucosylation, Fut9 and Slc35c1. Ablation of fucosylation confers resistance to the bioweapon ricin, and we discover proteins that carry a fucosylation-dependent sugar code for ricin toxicity. Mutations disrupting a subset of these proteins render cells ricin resistant, revealing new players that orchestrate ricin toxicity. Our comparative glycoproteomics platform, SugarQb, enables genome-wide insights into protein glycosylation and glycan modifications in complex biological systems.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Targeting neuronal activity-regulated neuroligin-3 dependency in high-grade glioma</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/YeG_6CjYoT4/nature24014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, and represent the leading cause of brain tumour-related death in both children and adults. Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K–mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K–mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             Research on neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex has focused on the existence
                and strength of synapses between neurons, and their location on the cell bodies and
                dendrites of postsynaptic neurons. The synaptic architecture of individual
                presynaptic axonal trees, however, remains largely unknown. Here we used dense
                reconstructions from three-dimensional electron microscopy in rats to study the
                synaptic organization of local presynaptic axons in layer 2 of the medial entorhinal
                cortex, the site of grid-like spatial representations. We observe
                path-length-dependent axonal synapse sorting, such that axons of excitatory neurons
                sequentially target inhibitory neurons followed by excitatory neurons. Connectivity
                analysis revealed a cellular feedforward inhibition circuit involving wide,
                myelinated inhibitory axons and dendritic synapse clustering. Simulations show that
                this high-precision circuit can control the propagation of synchronized activity in
                the medial entorhinal cortex, which is known for temporally precise discharges.

             In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon
                specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer
                    types. However, the underlying mechanisms that direct
                this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its
                systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility. Here,
                we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the
                early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire
                highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG
                density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The
                extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of
                embryonically protected CpG island promoters, particularly those that are associated
                with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human
                cancer types. Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of
                extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based
                suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which
                coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made
                deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used—and frequently
                oncogenic—signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic
                cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may
                therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous
                reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape.

                Microbiome Project has provided one of the broadest such characterizations so far.
                Here we introduce a second wave of data from the study, comprising 1,631 new
                metagenomes (2,355 total) targeting diverse body sites with multiple time points in
                265 individuals. We applied updated profiling and assembly methods to provide new
                characterizations of microbiome personalization. Strain identification revealed
                subspecies clades specific to body sites; it also quantified species with

At a personal level I don't understand all the hubbub,  because I accepted that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;mind = brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when I entered graduate school to study neuroscience. But for others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Coming to terms with the neural basis of who we are can be very  unnerving. It has been called &lt;b&gt;“neuroexistentialism”&lt;/b&gt;, which really  captures the essence of it. We’re not in the habit of thinking about  ourselves that way” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029450-200-the-benefits-of-realising-youre-just-a-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Churchland, 2013&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's very 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2CWu6CYD-g/WbrGkZexAKI/AAAAAAAAMQI/ZJmKSikslpcMYeG9fnZgGmCwJBqyymCZACLcBGAs/s1600/Neuroexistentialism%2Bcover.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;805&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2CWu6CYD-g/WbrGkZexAKI/AAAAAAAAMQI/ZJmKSikslpcMYeG9fnZgGmCwJBqyymCZACLcBGAs/s400/Neuroexistentialism%2Bcover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neuroexistentialism &lt;/i&gt;is also the title of a forthcoming volume of essays edited by Caruso and Flanagan. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroexistentialism: Third-Wave Existentialism&quot;&gt;introductory chapter&lt;/a&gt;, Flanagan and Caruso define this philosophical variant in the progression of existentialisms to the present third-wave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“There are three kinds of existentialism that respond to three different kinds of grounding projects—grounding in God’s nature, in a shared vision of the collective good, or in science. The first-wave existentialism of Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche expressed anxiety about the idea that meaning and morals are made secure because of God’s omniscience and good will. The second-wave existentialism of Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, was a post-holocaust response to the idea that some uplifting secular vision of the common good might serve as a foundation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today, there is a third-wave existentialism, neuroexistentialism, which expresses the anxiety that even as science yields the truth about human nature it also disenchants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The theory of evolution together with advances in neuroscience remove the last vestiges of an immaterial soul or self that can know the nature of what is really true, good, and beautiful.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don't understand why the neuroscientific view must be so disenchanting. (But then again I'm a neuroscientist.) I knew fellow students who went to church yet easily reconciled their cell culture day jobs with their religious beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patriciachurchland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Patricia Churchland&lt;/a&gt; is the best at explaining the “Don't Worry, Be Happy” response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029450-200-the-benefits-of-realising-youre-just-a-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuroexistential terror&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q - Some might say the idea that you are just your brain makes life  bleak, unforgiving and ultimately futile. How do you respond to that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A - It’s  not at all bleak. I don’t see how the existence of a god or a soul  confers any meaning on my life. How does that work, exactly? Nobody has  ever given an adequate answer. My life is meaningful because I have  family, meaningful work, because I love to play, I have dogs, I love to  dig in the garden. That’s what makes my life meaningful, and I think  that’s true for most people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s1600/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;358&quot; data-original-width=&quot;792&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s400/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Word cloud for the 18 chapter titles in &lt;i&gt;Neuroexistentialism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scope of Neuroexistentialsim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, it's about free will, morality, meaning, and purpose. And of course neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my puzzlement about who suffers from a modern-day ailment caused by science spoilers. I found the below sentence to be both condescending and hyperbolic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;But for most ordinary folk and many members of the nonscientific academy, the idea that humans are animal and that the mind is the brain is destabilizing and disenchanting, quite possibly nauseating, a source of dread, fear and trembling, sickness unto death even.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the authors overascribe the illness and exaggerate the depth of ennui experienced by “most ordinary folk” who are too busy to grapple with the scientific implications of social neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don't mean to be overly snarky but right now I'm grappling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;, and with second-wave existential crises caused by crazed leaders with bad hair who wave around their phallic symbols of nuclear destruction, and with persisting racism that divides the country, and with the hypocrisy of anti-immigration Christians, and with a future of toxic air and coastal regions underwater. Maybe what I'm experiencing is actually fourth-wave existentialism...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f1gxkcHHQGc/WcDJhSZpU7I/AAAAAAAAMQ8/DXcd3fjL4GoN5Cmiiv9ftX5AxVBgrTsEgCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BCircle%2Bof%2BNeuroexistentialism.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;450&quot; data-original-width=&quot;489&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f1gxkcHHQGc/WcDJhSZpU7I/AAAAAAAAMQ8/DXcd3fjL4GoN5Cmiiv9ftX5AxVBgrTsEgCLcBGAs/s320/The%2BCircle%2Bof%2BNeuroexistentialism.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medicating Neuroexistential Angst&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If neuroexistentialism is a narrow form of generalized anxiety or even panic, can't we use our scientific knowledge to sooth these troubled brains? Why not apply psychopharmacological principles (and/or psychotherapy) to calm the fearful and trembling mind? We have already presupposed that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;mind = brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (which brought us “sickness unto death even”), and that medications can alter brain function in psychiatric disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not the correct way forward (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“...Are there naturalistic resources that can quell the anxiety produced by the ascendancy of the scientific image generally, and specifically, the picture that comes from combining neo-Darwinism with neuroscience, which produces the new and nerve-wracking anxiety associated with neuroexistentialism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One promising approach is to pursue a kind of descriptive-normative inquiry into the causes and conditions of flourishing for material beings living in a material world, whose self-understanding includes the idea that such a world is the only kind of world that there is and thus that the meaning and significance of their lives, if there is any, must be found in such a world. We can call such an inquiry&lt;i&gt; eudaimonics&lt;/i&gt; (Flanagan 2007, 2009).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the solution to third-wave existentialism is positive psychology (as opposed to despair).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism#Despair&quot;&gt;Despair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the   conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is   in even when he isn't overtly in despair. So long as a person's   identity depends on qualities that can crumble, he is considered to be   in perpetual despair. And as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human   essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the   individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s1600/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;884&quot; data-original-width=&quot;614&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s400/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/existential-neuroscience-field-in.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Existential Neuroscience: a field in search of meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in 2013, the field of Existential Neuroscience (distinct from Neuroexistentialism) took the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;SCAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by storm, with neuroimaging studies focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terror management theory&lt;/a&gt; (which describes how we deal with the inevitability of death).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some brains struck by pathology seem to stave off its effects thanks to a “cognitive reserve”: a superior use of mental resources that may be related to the way we use our brains over a lifetime, for instance through high levels of education or, possibly, learning a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilingual people certainly seem to use their brains differently. For example, practice at switching languages has been associated with enhanced mental control. It’s even been claimed that being bilingual can stave off dementia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/100218-bilingual-brains-alzheimers-dementia-science-aging/&quot;&gt;up to four or five years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, this would have serious implications for public policy – learning a second language would be as much a desirable health behaviour as it is an educational or cultural one. But are the brain benefits of bilingualism real? The &lt;i&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/i&gt; has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170131&quot;&gt;a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; to establish the strength of the evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30079&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University College London research team, led by Naaheed Mukadam, surveyed hundreds of papers published up to November 2016, finding fourteen high-quality studies that measured dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment (a more subtle analogue and frequent precursor of dementia) as well as participants’ status as either mono-lingual or bilingual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the studies drew their conclusions from patients who had attended clinics complaining of memory problems, and their results were in favour of bilingualism. In one study, the age of diagnosis for amnesic mild cognitive impairment was around four to five years later for bilingual patients compared to monolingual. Another five studies asked when people began noticing their symptoms, and these also found the similar four to five year delay for bilinguals. Two of the eight found no significant effects, but the preponderance of evidence here looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, all of these papers were retrospective, and depended on when people decided to show up to a clinic, and/or their accurate dating of when their symptoms began. Complicating matters is the fact that bilingual people from minority ethnic backgrounds are known to seek help later for dementia, on average, probably for social and cultural reasons. Moreover, these studies rarely controlled for education, which tends to be higher for non-minority multi-linguals, and as education itself contributes to cognitive reserve, this may be another confound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better controlled studies that identify a sample of people free from dementia and then follow them in the future are easier to interpret. Mukadam’s team identified five such studies. These found that five years after recruitment there were no significant differences between bilingual and monolingual participants in terms of whether they had developed any memory problems or neurological diagnoses. A meta-analysis using the raw diagnosis numbers from each study – a total of just over 5,000 participants – confirmed that bilingualism does not stave off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a weak evidence base doesn’t mean an effect isn’t real. Indeed, more recent research from a team of Italian researchers used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/7/1690.full&quot;&gt;neuroimaging techniques&lt;/a&gt; to make a more systematic case for the benefits of bilingualism, including that it is associated with greater neural connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Italian work is too recent to feature in the new review, but it’s notable that it escapes some of the methodological problems discussed above. However, when I brought this to Naaheed Makadem (the lead author of the new review), she raised a few considerations: firstly, that the new neuroimaging study investigated people who were generally lifelong bilinguals, living in a bilingual context (the Italian-German borderlands of Italy), which affords more opportunities for lifelong mode-switching than would be found for cases of adult migration or deciding to pick up a new language; secondly, she points to other potential confounding factors, such as employment and social status (i.e. the apparent neural advantages of bilinguals might be related to their being more likely to be in employment and higher social status).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi-lingual mind may have important consequences, but it’s not clear that recommendations to learn a second language later in life will necessarily produce the protections that have been claimed. Makadem’s team conclude their work by suggesting that “public health policy should therefore remove recommendations regarding bilingualism as a strategy to delay dementia and instead concentrate on more generally reducing cognitive inactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Science Exchange Survey Reveals Pain Points of Outsourcing R&amp;D</title>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/09/science-exchange-survey-reveals-pain-points-of-outsourcing-rd/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contract review, service provider qualification, and security of intellectual property among major concerns for biotech and pharma leaders surveyed at 2017 industry conferences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.– More than 100 biotechnology and drug development leaders who responded to surveys conducted during industry conferences earlier this year reported a wide range of barriers to the outsourcing of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) services, including the contracts review process, intellectual property (IP) security concerns, and service provider qualification. The surveys were conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51684706&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170918005083&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Science+Exchange&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=d9ebe5ccb2e80e5f010a479455ac2f70&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), during the 2017 Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) International Convention and 2017 Drug Industry Association (DIA) Global Annual Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 75 percent of Science Exchange survey respondents ranked the following concerns as barriers (a significant barrier or somewhat of a barrier) to the outsourcing of R&amp;amp;D services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Having contracts reviewed and signed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Security of IP;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Identifying service providers with required expertise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Qualifying service providers; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Negotiating pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management related to R&amp;amp;D outsourcing was also reported as having a significant impact on these R&amp;amp;D leaders, with over 40 percent of those responding to the survey indicating they spent more than 20 hours to onboard each new outsourcing partner, from the request for proposal process, through contracting and start of the project. Finally, further demonstrating the impact of the time spent on administrative tasks related to outsourcing, more than 75 percent of survey respondents reported that the “hassle” of bringing on a new partner has previously led them to choose an existing vendor rather than seek out a more qualified option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The results of this survey echo the same concerns we heard from the leading biotech and pharma companies who now rely on Science Exchange to help them efficiently manage their outsourced R&amp;amp;D services,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “In review of enterprise clients’ experiences, we find that our Science Exchange clients save thousands of work hours each year on procurement, business operations, contracting and legal resources, and administrative tasks related to outsourcing — time that can instead be spent in discovery. It’s gratifying to see that we’re able to fulfill our goal to support the scientific discovery process by removing barriers to innovation for our clients.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: When neurogenesis goes wrong…</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/VUT_ywAeuoY/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PLOSOne-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is a complex biological process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Indeed, the discovery of a dynamic neurogenesis in the adult brain (in both humans and animals) was a kind of extraordinary revelation. In fact, contrary to common popular belief, neurogenesis continuously occurs in specific regions in the adult brain, such as in the hippocampus and the striatum. Neurogenesis occurs in both physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
In the hippocampus, newly born granule cells (GC) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) migrate in the granule cell layer and become functionally integrated into neuronal networks within four to six weeks. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that newborn neurons generated in the context of cerebral ischemia may fail to correctly integrate into pre-existing networks. However, the cellular mechanisms of how ischemic infarcts cause alteration of hippocampal functions are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory, neurogenesis and morphological alterations following cerebral stroke &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183463&quot;&gt;PLOS One article&lt;/a&gt;, Woitke and collegues (Jena University Hospital, Germany) hypothesized that increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following stroke may be associated with aberrant neurogenic activity and impaired hippocampus-dependent functions. This might sound somehow counterintuitive, since one would expect that increased neurogenesis may lead to improved cognitive functions. But this is not the case, or at least it does not represent the full and exact picture of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is well known that cerebral stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, although the functional role of this post-lesion response is mostly unclear. In a physiological context, neurogenesis is strictly regulated and less than 1% of new neurons have aberrant connections in the intact brain. Things may be different following brain damage and insults (strokes, seizures, etc). Using behavioral and viral approaches “&lt;em&gt;we now prove,&lt;/em&gt;” says Woitke, the leading author of the study, “&lt;em&gt;that aberrant neurogenesis also occurs in the murine hippocampus and is associated with poorer performance in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks following focal infarcts.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a first attempt, Woitke and colleagues performed the Morris Water Maze (MWM), a hippocampus-dependent behavioral task routinely used to assess spatial memory functions. Parameters such as latencies (“time to find the platform”) and distance (“path lengths”) to navigate to the platform were analyzed. As expected, brain ischemic mice generally needed more time to locate the platform, thus suggesting impaired learning and memory functions. In addition, analysis of the adaptive learning strategies in both groups revealed that animals with stroke used a less efficient navigation strategy to find the platform, while hippocampal-dependent strategies were employed more frequently by the control group. When looking at neurogenesis processes the authors observed an increased number of new born neurons in the hippocampus of mice with stroke. Thus, in a second set of experiments, the authors addressed the question of whether the newly generated neurons may have aberrant morphology and location, which in turn may be related to malfunction of hippocampal networks and circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Using retroviral labeling, we detected a significant number of new GC with atypical morphology and dendritic branching following ischemia,&lt;/em&gt;” says Silke Keiner, the senior author of the study. In particular, GC displayed an additional dendritic tree extending from the basal pole towards the hilus (a specific subregion of the dentate gyrus) which is considered a typical immature feature of GC neurons. Taken together, ischemia increases the number of newborn neurons but promotes aberrant dendritic branching indicating maladaptive plasticity in the DG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that integrated and functional neurons require dendritic spines. Interestingly, the expression of mature mushroom spines by aberrant newborn cells strongly suggests that these neurons are synaptically integrated, thus being able to influence and alter hippocampal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this study reveals that even a low number of aberrant neurons may severely affect hippocampal functions such as learning and memory. However, the casual link among cellular modifications, neurogenesis and impaired memory functions is far from being fully elucidated. In fact, the analysis of the functional impact of adult neurogenesis in behavioral experiments or cognitive tasks is still quite challenging. As mentioned by the authors, “&lt;em&gt;more studies are needed to clarify whether tailored rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches might counteract aberrant neurogenesis and improve hippocampal-dependent memory performance.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Decision-making: the Role of Neuronal Crowdsourcing</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/18/decision-making-the-role-of-neuronal-crowdsourcing/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making, in most cases, is not a straightforward process. Facing contradictory facts and opinions, people often struggle to decide on the best way forward when a complicated problem needs to be solved. In human society, we eventually rely on two methods of decision-making: we can follow the will of the majority, or we can delegate the task of decision-making to a leader thus leaving all deliberations (and responsibilities) to this single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists ask: How does this works on the level of brain cells? If your brain has to make a decision, how do your individual neurons come to a unified conclusion? Do they use the “majority mechanism”? Or maybe there are some neurons whose “opinion” dominates the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter approach is known as a “grandmother theory”. Grandmother analogy was suggested in the 1960s to propagate the idea that the final decision about a single event may be taken by one dominant neuron. However, scientists also suggested that the process might be more “democratic” and involve the contribution of multiple neurons in generating the final outcome. This process is sometimes described as neuronal “crowdsourcing”.  The most recent data points to the possibility that both processes play a role in the human &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/01/the-neurology-of-anxiety-in-times-of-critical-decision-making/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to any decision is a complex mental process involving the weighing and choosing from a number of options, with each option having various characteristics. Decision-making is not a reflex action. When we make a decision there are some expected or foreseen consequences. And it is also important to note that in making any decision, we use the information that has been accumulated in our brain prior to the time of making that decision. Finally, every decision made involves &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/17/deciphering-troubled-teens-risk-taking-behavior/&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, as there is a degree of uncertainty around making decisions, and we are aware that many of these decisions can have long-term consequences. Although we know that decision-making plays a central part in our mental development, very little is known about how it occurs at the neuronal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision-making events are far more common than we tend to think. It is not simply deciding the way to take while &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/28/the-brain-road-link-new-evidence-on-cell-phones-and-driving/&quot;&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt;, or what food to have for a lunch. Decision-making is involved even in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/01/mind-your-dishes-mundane-tasks-to-improve-mental-health/&quot;&gt;easiest of tasks&lt;/a&gt;. What seems a simple task at first may have quite a complex mechanism underlying it. Just take any simple conversation as an example. Most words used in a conversation can have multiple meanings, and decisions regarding their appropriate use have to be taken at very high speed. These can be called momentous decisions: they do not require a high level of thinking and are often based on prior experience. At the neuronal level, such decisions are often taken by small groups of neurons or can even be taken by a single dominant neuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all decisions are momentous. Some decisions require a high level of thinking and calculation, and they require taking the long-term outcome of the decision into consideration. For long-term decision-making, we voluntarily focus on various information sources, and then we decide what is and is not relevant in achieving our long-term goals. Moreover, our decisions continually change according to changes in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on macaque monkeys have shown that a large part of the brain is involved in collecting information in the initial steps of decision-making. After a certain time period, when enough information is processed, the cells reach a threshold where a decision has to be made. It is at this point, it seems, that all cells start to shift in favor of one single criterion and the decision is made. It appears that when the task is complex and there are too many choices, crowdsourcing works best. Lots of information is analyzed before all of the neurons come to a single decision, and this decision is communicated to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to say that quick decision-making cannot be done with crowdsourcing. In fact, many decisions would likely make use of more distant parts of the brain and multiple neurons. We are often faced with decisions that are complex yet have to be taken quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/27/thinking-slow-about-thinking-fast-part-iv-the-framing-effect/&quot;&gt;Quick decisions&lt;/a&gt; have their own benefits and risks. There are higher chances of error, yet, in many cases, making a decision quickly is imperative. It is quite possible that the brain has some kind of mechanism to minimize this rate of error for quick and decentralized decision-making. The process of crowdsourcing and decentralized decision-making has been studied in detail in colonies of ants, where many decisions are taken by the crowd, though it often comes at the cost of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether decision-making is prompt or delayed, a factor that seems to be of great influence is the expected reward or outcome. It is quite possible that certain areas of the brain may be dedicated to it. Thus playing the role of influencers, be it the decision of some small group of neurons or crowdsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever way the decision-making is done, what seems to be evident from animal studies is that it has two phases. The first phase is information gathering, and the second phase consists of coming to a consensus and making the final decision. To a degree that depends on the situation, this final step may be influenced by more important neurons. Unsurprising considering the complexity of the mechanisms involved, the ‘details’ of this process are cloudy at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what a woman is really thinking, ask another woman. That’s the message of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01324/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_352999_69_Psycho_20170808_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; which was designed to probe our ability to use other people’s posture, facial expressions and behaviours, as well our interpretations of ambiguous statements, to infer what’s going on in their mind – no matter what they’re actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Renata Wacker at the Free University of Berlin, Germany, recruited 304 women and 241 men, ranging in age from 17 to 70. The volunteers were put through possibly the most irritating – though potentially clinically useful – movie-watching experience imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29973&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition is a 15-minute fictional film that focuses on the social interactions between two female and two male middle-aged adults preparing for and getting together for dinner. The film pauses no fewer than forty-five times for the viewer to answer questions about the characters’ thoughts, intentions and emotions. (For example, “What is Cliff thinking?”, “Why is Betty saying this?”, and “What is Michael feeling?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each question has four multiple choice answers, three of which are wrong – for instance, in one pre-dinner scene, Cliff and Sandra are enjoying chatting about Cliff’s recent holiday in Sweden, then Michael arrives and dominates the conversation, directing all his speech at Sandra. Slightly annoyed, Sandra looks at Cliff then asks Michael if he’s been to Sweden. Participants are asked why she did this: the correct answer is to help get Cliff back into the conversation; an example of an incorrect answer is to loosen Michael up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work has found that this test can pick up mind-reading deficits in autism, borderline personality disorder and body dysmorphic disorders, and can measure individual differences in mind-reading ability in typical adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers found that overall the female volunteers got significantly better scores than the men. This didn’t come as a huge surprise, as other work has found that, on average, women are better at inferring other people’s mental states and identifying facial expressions. But the analysis also revealed that women were better at mind-reading other women than they were at reading men. Men were also slightly better at reading women than men, but they still scored lower than the female participants (note that, unlike women, men didn’t show an own-sex mind-reading advantage – they weren’t any better at reading men than women were).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation for women being easier to read could be that they are more emotionally expressive than men, as suggested by some past research, although a recent study found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/18/do-women-really-show-their-emotions-more-than-men/&quot;&gt;the true gender pattern is more complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the superior performance of the female volunteers, this may be because women are simply better at mind-reading. Alternatively, they may be more motivated to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287568&quot;&gt;Differences in male and female friendships&lt;/a&gt; may be one factor that contributes to greater mind-reading skills in women, the researchers suggested. Research has found that women are more likely to share emotions with, and simply to talk more with, their female friends than men do with their male friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the women’s particular skill at reading other women’s thoughts, “the proposed social-cognitive mechanism and developmental factors of this bias have to be examined in following studies,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also re-analysed their data, this time with a focus on the volunteers’ ages. They found that young adults were better mind-readers, overall. Performance started to decrease around the age of 30, and continued to get worse through middle and old age. It’s possible this is partly because of known age-related declines in cognitive performance, but again, this is something that will have to be explored in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Environmental Factors in Development of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is one of those conditions where genetics is known to play a profound role but is not the sole factor in disease development and progression. The evidence is mounting that the environment has a great deal to do with the development of this neurodegenerative disorder. Moreover, it is now known that the right kind of nutrition and lifestyle may play preventive role in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain environmental factors, like exposure to toxic chemicals and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, have long been known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s, dementia, and Parkinsonism. However, the intricacies of this interaction between the environment and genetics is poorly understood. What we know for sure is that the environment does play an important role in the diseases’ development and that certain genes can be predisposing factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a gene called APOE4 is considered to be one of the major risk factors in developing familial &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, studies have shown the much lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s in sub-Saharan Africans as compared to Africans living in Western societies, where pollution, industrial food, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle render people more susceptible to the disease. There have been very few studies comparing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s among genetically similar populations living in completely different environments. One such study compared the residents of a small Nigerian town with African Americans and found the incidence of Alzheimer’s much higher among those living in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at the factors that have been strongly linked with neurodegeneration, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to and poisoning with &lt;strong&gt;heavy metals and pesticides&lt;/strong&gt; has been well studied and documented. However, neurodegeneration occurs due to chronic low-level exposure to these toxic elements. The long term accumulative&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/06/how-prenatal-lead-exposure-results-in-neurodevelopmental-disorders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exposure to lead&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to cause a decrease in memory and progressive decline in mental functions.  In contrast to lead, the role of aluminium has long been overlooked. This metal is present in many medications (like antacid suspensions). Aluminium is an additive in various commercially available food products, food colorants, and is even used to purify water. There is increasing evidence that it may be playing a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pollution&lt;/strong&gt; is something to that many of us are exposed to from a very young age, and in most cases, we do not have much choice. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/19/fighting-mental-and-physical-illness-by-reshaping-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polluted air&lt;/a&gt; in large cities contains a toxic cocktail of organic and non-organic compounds, metals, and gases. Evidence of a link between neurodegeneration and air pollution is growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in developing nations, non-infectious diseases are the main health threat in Western societies, and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unhealthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; is the main causative factor in the development of serious chronic conditions. Some estimates suggest that &lt;strong&gt;obesity and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt; are now killing more people than any other disease. Research data show that the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease increases by as much as 6-fold in obese people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; decreases the risk of almost any disease, thus having a direct and indirect effect on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/07/can-diet-accelerate-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;development of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; as well. Apart from physical exercise, it is also important to stay mentally active. Older people who continue to participate in &lt;strong&gt;mental activities&lt;/strong&gt;, such as learning new things, reading, or even listening to music have a lower chance of declines in brain function. Social participation may also help to stay mentally active. Many people tend to become isolated as they grow old. However, maintaining a high level of social activity not only decreases stress and improves mood but may also prevent or delays Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological stress&lt;/strong&gt; results in an increased level of stress hormones that have been shown to be damaging for brain functionality. Emotional distress like depression and anxiety in young people and middle-aged adults is thought to increase the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s later in life. Some researchers think that emotional distress could be considered an early symptom of neurodegeneration. There is now a wide consensus that emotional distress is a risk factor for dementia and mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps the single most important factor that can either prevent or aggregate mental decline. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is a preventive factor, due to the high content of vitamins, microelements, and antioxidants. Diets with a high saturated fat and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; content are harmful, as these fats block blood vessels and are the reason for stroke and cardiac diseases. As the brain is mostly made of fats, it is important to have a balanced diet. Omega-3 has been shown to be neuroprotective, and products like fish oil, soya oil, and walnuts, are a rich source of this compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The familial genetic history of neurodegenerative diseases does not necessarily mean that a person will develop mental decline. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/24/surprising-role-of-prions-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; are still highly preventable. By avoiding triggers in the environment and living a healthy, active life, one may expect to remain mentally alert until ripe old age.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Oscillatory Thoughts: The neuroscience tenure-track</title>
	<link>http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/the-neuroscience-tenure-track.html</link>
	<content:encoded>The point of this post is to tell my story and explain, as best I can and in as much detail as possible, my path toward &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/hello-san-diego.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accepting a tenure-track position at UCSD&lt;/a&gt;. I will attempt to give as many factual and quantitative details as possible (where appropriate) for people who might be looking to &quot;compare&quot; in their own job hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brief aside: I'm going to shy away from discussing issues of gender, sex, nationality, class, parenthood, and race because--while I know those factors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/the-academic-gender-bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/race-discrimination-in-academia-has-not-improved-over-past-20-years/2003102.article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/05/23/nokids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; in academia--they're too complex for me to be able to adequately address. However I would like to happily note that the chair of my new home department of Cognitive Science, the chair of the search committee, and the two other computational faculty are all women from a diversity of backgrounds. For those who are curious, I myself am of mixed race from a working class family, but that is as much as I will say on the matter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that the academic path is variable and uncertain. When I was on the job hunt I remember looking at other peoples' CVs to see how mine stacked up. I looked at where other post-docs (my competition) published their papers. I looked at their &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-indices and grants and conference proceedings. I remember thinking, &quot;what do I have that could possibly make me stand out compared to these amazing scientists&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We encounter this uncertainty repeatedly in academia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will I pass my qualifying exams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I come up with a novel hypothesis and run an experiment, from start to finish, to test it properly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I know enough to do so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I successfully defend my thesis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a post-doc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run experiments over and over again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delegate work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a grant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a tenure-track job?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run a lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/04/why-i-chose-academia.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do I even want to keep doing this or just go and make real money?&lt;/a&gt; Academia isn't the only job for us. If you don't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want it, you should seriously ask yourself why you're pursuing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've struggled at every step along the way. There's been doubt, for sure, but I've talked about all these things in detail on here already and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2011/08/career-advice.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to give advice where possible&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/02/anti-items-in-cvs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trying to do my part to mitigate the doubt of future scientists&lt;/a&gt; (and this post is yet another attempt at that) while being as honest as possible. That's important to me because I feel like there's a lack of clarity in the academic job process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's get to the details (skip to the &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; end if you just want to compare numbers and CVs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried applying for faculty jobs in Oct/Nov 2010. I applied to psychology jobs at both Stanford and UCLA. This was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; early; I'd just finished my PhD but three of my thesis projects were published that that year, one each in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-neuron-paper-dynamic.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/10/voytek-pnas-paper-prefrontal-cortex-and.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-frontiers-in-human-neuroscience.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, each cited (by now) at least 30 times (so they had a decent scientific impact). It was a big year so I thought I'd &quot;dip my toe in the water&quot; and strike while the iron was hot, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that no one--no friends, faculty who wrote my letters of recommendation, etc.--actually thought I'd get a job, but I wanted the practice in applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ah, the academic life before parenthood... I finished writing my job applications on a ferry leaving Kobe, Japan after giving an invited presentation at the International Congress of Clinical Neurophysiology, which was an &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; trip for my wife and I.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to this round of applications I got nothing back but form letter rejections around Feb/Mar the following year. But I honestly didn't mind because I had a good post-doc job and I wasn't expecting anything anyway. I really wasn't emotionally invested (by intent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pause here: I want to note that the applications I sent weren't great. The research statements were weak and I didn't do a good job explicitly stating my overall research theme and goals. This is a skill at which I often fail but one the importance of which I cannot emphasize enough:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You know your work better than anyone which makes it easy to forget to be explicit and connect all the dots, but &lt;b&gt;you need to connect those dots and frame your work clearly within the bigger picture&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The committee reading your application won't know your subfield like you do. If you apply to a department that has a broad mission like Cognitive Science--which ranges from computer science to anthropology--you need to make sure you explain your work in a way that everyone can understand and appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the 2011 application deadline came around I didn't bother applying for any jobs because I'd just had my first child a few months beforehand. Furthermore I'd just started my current post-doc and I was really excited to get those projects going. I wasn't in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 2012 applications (again, Nov/Dec) I decided to make a second tentative attempt. My post-doc grant still had a few more years of funding, but several jobs opened that just &quot;felt right&quot;. Stanford had a vision science position that sounded like a good fit, UCLA had an opening in psychology, and UCSD had a position in the Department of Cognitive Science for a computational cognitive scientist doing work in data-mining, BCI, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Can you tell I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wanted to stay in California?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainscanr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainSCANr&lt;/a&gt; paper was just published and some of the work I had currently under review were data-mining projects, UCSD seemed like an excellent, rare fit. Again, it was a bit early because none of my post-doc work was published and, again, I wasn't emotionally committed (meaning I was steeled against failure), but I'd have kicked myself if I didn't try. The cost of entry is very low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My applications were much stronger this time. While my CV wasn't phenomenally better, by this point I'd begun running my own mini-lab inside my post-doc lab and I had two &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; strong papers under review at &quot;good journals&quot; (bleeeeech I hate saying that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late January I heard that I wasn't short-listed for the UCLA job. Apparently I was &quot;strongly considered&quot;, and much-discussed, but in the end they wanted a behavioral neuroscientist (not a cognitive/computational person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As opposed to the first time I tried applying, this time I got personal letters back from faculty on both the UCLA and Stanford committees (&quot;I decided to write you to thank you personally for your application... I am a real fan of the work you are doing...&quot;) Honestly I wasn't even upset; those folks seriously know how to make someone feel good about being rejected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was sitting at home with my wife the night I got the rejection from UCLA, I received an email from UCSD while I was nursing my wounds (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, watching &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; or whatever). They asked me if I was still interested in the position to which I had applied.  I re-read that email several times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding. I had my wife read it, too, to verify. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. So I set up a phone meeting with the UCSD cognitive science search committee chair and we arranged a date for me to fly down for my job talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were six weeks between that phone call and my interview. Now, I've given a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of scientific talks, both for large audiences and small, for lay-people and specialists. When I gave my first practice talk at my lab's meeting a few weeks before my job talk, it was &lt;i&gt;okay&lt;/i&gt;, but far from great. I made four mistakes that you should avoid:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did a poor job explaining the narrative flow linking one experiment to the next.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to fit in too much (the &quot;everything plus the kitchen sink&quot; approach). I'm excited about research--my research in particular (hence why I want to stay in academia)--but you have to know which parts to cut. Less really is more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't leave people with a strong feeling of the overarching theme of my work...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nor did I adequately leave them with a sense of excitement about the future of my work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are hard problems to tackle! But the solution to several of them is essentially: &lt;i&gt;be explicit&lt;/i&gt;. The narrative flow is an easy problem to address, because it essentially recapitulates &lt;i&gt;what really happened during the course of your research career&lt;/i&gt;. Meaning papers &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; are extensions based off papers &lt;i&gt;n-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n-2&lt;/i&gt;, ...&lt;i&gt;n-i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So &lt;b&gt;talk about them that way&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I practiced my talk in front of other people two more times: once with my PhD lab and once for my wife and a friend. I did a final practice run on my own, speaking slowly to make sure I wouldn't go over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make sure you do not go over time&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone hates that. Don't make everyone hate you because of a dumb issue like amateur time mismanagement. Everyone's time is valuable; don't hold your audience hostage. It's rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My visit to San Diego was not without some frustrations. My visit was scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, with my talk being Wednesday at noon. The visit was to begin with an 8am breakfast, followed by meetings with the search committee chair and departmental chair, and then my talk. After the talk there were more meetings, dinner with some faculty, and then another full day of one-on-one meetings with faculty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unwisely (in hindsight) I decided to fly down late the night before my talk so that I could help my wife with getting our son from daycare, fed, bathed, etc. My flight was scheduled to arrive in San Diego at 10:40pm. I assumed I'd grab a taxi to my hotel near UCSD's campus and be in bed by midnight. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as we were landing the pilot suddenly kicked the engines into high gear (or whatever the aeronautical equivalent term is) and began to ascend. After circling San Diego's airport for about 30-40 minutes we were informed that, because of dense fog, we were being diverted to Los Angeles. We finally landed at LAX at around 11:30pm, after which time we were to wait around for busses that would then drive us to the San Diego airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was all carry-on so I was ready to go as soon as we landed. But I did the quick math and, by the time all the other passengers got their luggage, the mob figured out what to do, boarded the busses, and finally got on the road, it would be about 1am. Add a 2-hour drive to the San Diego airport, and then another 30-40 minutes &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; north to UCSD... that would get me into my hotel room at around 3-4am. I opted out of that arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling a few friends in LA to see if I could catch a late-night ride to San Diego (and offer up my hotel room to my generous driver for a night) I was reminded that the following morning (the morning of my job talk) was my good friend's memorial service. A close friend of ours had recently, unexpectedly, died, so &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of my closest friends in LA were attending his services (which I had to miss for the job talk... ugh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/10/17/neuroscientist-bradley-voytek-is-bringing-the-silicon-valley-ethos-into-academia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work for a car company&lt;/a&gt; so I requested an Uber to come pick me up. I explained to the the poor guy that came to get me that this wasn't a quick 20 minute ride (long drive, late night, job interview, etc.) I told him I didn't expect him to do such a long trip so late at night in the middle of the week. Amazingly the guy agreed to drive me anyway and was a &lt;i&gt;god damn champ&lt;/i&gt;. As I apologized for the bumper-to-bumper 1am Thursday LA traffic he just kept saying, &quot;my job is to get you to your job interview well-rested, so don't worry.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I got checked into my hotel it was about 2:00am. I figured I'd get up at 7:30, quick shower and shave, throw on my suit, and meet for breakfast in the lobby at 8am. But whomever stayed in the hotel room before me had different plans, so &lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;surprise&lt;/i&gt;! when the alarm in my room went off at 6:15am (I was using my phone's alarm plus a wake up call to wake me up... I hadn't checked the room's alarm clock). Once I figured out how to turn the damn thing off I was &lt;i&gt;awake&lt;/i&gt;. Too excited from the cortisol/adrenaline rush to go back to sleep now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took my time, got ready, had some coffee, checked my email, and went for a walk around the hotel (which was beautiful, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s1600/IMG_1202.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s400/IMG_1202.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s1600/IMG_1204.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s400/IMG_1204.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s1600/IMG_1201.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s400/IMG_1201.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Needless to say I had no problem getting to my 8am breakfast on time. But I was looking at a non-stop 13-hour day of interviews, job talk, meetings, and socializing on about 3-3.5 hours of sleep (and knowing all of my closest friends were grieving for another very close friend).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;When I first did that simple math I suddenly became very thankful for the last 18 months of parenthood for teaching me how to cope with sleep deprivation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Surprisingly I was so thrilled to be there that I don't really remember feeling overly tired. Thankfully the department had a lot of water (and a nice welcome bag with UCSD CogSci schwag) waiting for me, so I just kept hydrated and kept talking!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n9DVpsrAXp0/UW4fou6xXNI/AAAAAAAAFSQ/XiN9qi3T_O8/s1600/IMG_1206.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n9DVpsrAXp0/UW4fou6xXNI/AAAAAAAAFSQ/XiN9qi3T_O8/s400/IMG_1206.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're curious, here are the slides from my talk (not including all the extras I tack onto the end in case I get follow-up, clarification, or methodological questions... remember to always be a step or two ahead!) You'll note that I'm very text-light in my talks. I know my slides well so I use the figures and images on the pages to prompt me (no written or digital notes). I'm also a one-figure-per-page speaker when I can get away with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to hear me give a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; rough version of this talk, here's a video from a talk I did at Berkeley City College about 6 months beforehand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of comparison for you bean counters, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/voytek_cv_tt.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my CV&lt;/a&gt;, frozen at the time I got the job offer from UCSD. My &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-index was 8. I didn't have any &lt;i&gt;Nature &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; papers (but I did have a &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt; paper) nor any fancy grants (no K99, NRSA, etc.)  My most highly-cited primary research paper was an open-access paper published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;. I also had a few methods papers, including the more... non-standard... &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainscanr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainSCANr&lt;/a&gt; paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unusual thing I included was my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/10/crowdsourcing-letter-of-recommendation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;crowdsourced letter of recommendation&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which definitely seemed to have gotten peoples' attention.  My extracurricular activities (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com/lessons/diagnosing-a-zombie-brain-and-behavior-tim-verstynen-bradley-voytek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;zombie neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, blogging, outreach, etc.) weren't even really mentioned (in the positive or negative) so I'm not sure what the committee thought of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps give some idea of what this process is like.  Remember that there really &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a lot of luck involved. The departments need to be looking for someone who fills a niche they're lacking. While you can't control your academic fate because of this &quot;luck&quot; factor, you can do a few things to tip the balance in your favor: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Obviously) do good science in a field you love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network and get your name out there: speak at conferences, run symposia, reach out to faculty at universities when you're traveling to see if you can give a department colloquium or lab meeting. But I think &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; travel is becoming less important as social media and email grow ever more pervasive (invasive?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure other people know about your research (send PDFs of your papers to colleagues who've inspired your research).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your shit together and remember that this is a &lt;i&gt;job&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Masters in behavioral ecology, biodiversity, and evolution and have been a research engineer since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was trained in entomology, but in my job I mostly work on Neotropical mammals in French Guiana. I work from the field sessions to the laboratory, capturing and sampling of animals, and then molecular biology, population genetics, and taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area of research is interesting for me because I am very involved in ecological and conservation issues, which are a priority. Moreover, the alternation of the field and the laboratory, as well as a few projects beside, means that there is no routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started ten years ago. Passionate about insects, it was already a good way to explore this macro-universe and to discover details and fabulous texture. it is also a way to raise public awareness to the ecological cause, and highlight the gorgeousness of insects so unloved. Finally, it is a good excuse to be in nature…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken in a rainforest in French Guiana with a Canon 7D and a 100mm f/2.8 macro. I never use a flash, even in the dark forest I prefer keeping my ability to move, using natural light and increasing ISO if necessary. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com&quot;&gt;http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was involved in a capture field session of little mammals (rodents and marsupials) in the context of wildlife inventories. I always look to see if there are any interesting pictures to take, and this day, it was an ant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see an Ant of genus &lt;em&gt;Ectatomma&lt;/em&gt; who is wide-awake and standing on a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior is always interesting to observe because it shows the close mutualist relationship that exists between ants and myrmecophile plants: here, the host plant secretes nectar via specialized structures called domaties to feed ants and in exchange these ants protect the plant from predators. That is why, when the ant feels threatened, it takes a defensive position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth authored a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-07951-009&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on a trait she called “grit” which went on to arrest the attention of anyone interested in the secrets of success. TED talks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/&quot;&gt;a 2016 book&lt;/a&gt; followed, wherein Duckworth explained how a combination of passion for a topic, and perseverance in the face of difficulties – the two facets of grit – were the recipe for achievement, a claim borne out by studies &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550610385872&quot;&gt;within schools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2015-56733-003&quot;&gt;across the lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, researchers have become more critical of the scope and relevance of the concept. Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31799-001&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts&lt;/i&gt;, suggests grit gives surprisingly little insight into the world of creative success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29880&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first glance, grit seems a must for creatives. Countless artistic professionals associate their success with a passion for their chosen art form, and describe the necessity of perseverance in the face of obstacles and discouragement. But the value of grit isn’t backed by the three new studies from a team led by Magdalena Grohman at the University of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used Duckworth’s publicly available “&lt;a href=&quot;https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/&quot;&gt;grit scale&lt;/a&gt;” (which taps passion and perseverance); a personality questionnaire measuring the Big Five traits; and a self-report measure of creativity, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, which captures public achievement in ten different creative domains such as music or dance, with participants scoring higher if they’ve done things like played in a band or made an original composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an initial survey of 131 university students (two thirds women, average age 19), their creative achievement scores correlated with their scores on the personality measure of Openness to Experience, but showed no significant relationship with either facet of grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second larger study (325 students), with more comprehensive measures of grit and personality, found Openness again correlated with creativity, both on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire and on a measure of everyday creativity capturing frequency of activities such as writing or being a member of a camera club. But again, grit showed no correlation with either creative measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems surprising, but consider something: the first survey found the “passion” facet of grit (among other things, high scorers say that are not distracted by new ideas and projects) correlated &lt;i&gt;negatively &lt;/i&gt;with scores on Openness to Experience. Given that higher Openness is associated strongly with greater creativity, both here and in the wider literature, the negative correlation with grit should give us pause for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grohman’s team were ahead of us, highlighting that Duckworth defines passion primarily as a commitment to one thing at the expense of others (another example: on the grit scale, passionate people score lower on the item “I become interested in new pursuits every few months”). Openness, as the name suggests, is &lt;i&gt;all about&lt;/i&gt; becoming interested in new and different things. Moreover, there is no emotional element in the passion facet of grit as conceptualised by Duckworth: no measure of excitement, joy or elation by participating in the activity. Her notion of passion is less like the fiery, explorative artist, and more like a nerdy completionist devoting their time to finding that last sticker for their 1986 Panini sticker book. And that characterisation simply seems to miss the mark of what we mean by creative passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds unfair, consider Grohman and her colleague’s final study, where they asked high school students to rate classmates’ creativity, in terms of who produced the most original assignments. Their teachers were also asked to rate the students’ persistence and passion, in whatever way they understood those terms, and both these scores correlated with higher student creativity. The students’ self-reported perseverance (as measured by Duckworth’s grit questionnaire) also correlated weakly with their creativity, but this association disappeared once the researchers took account of differences in personality scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that teacher-rated passion and teacher-rated persistence correlated with creativity (even after accounting for personality), but that scores on the grit scale did not, suggests that passion is indeed relevant to creativity, but not as conceptualised by Duckworth’s notion of grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that these were student samples rather than professional creatives, so further work would need to be done there too, but given the conceptual tension between passion and Openness, it seems plausible to expect similar patterns to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave grit? Well, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845531&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that grit has only modest associations with performance, and is strongly associated with the incumbent personality predictor of success, trait Conscientiousness (also true in this study, with correlations between .54 and.65), it seems appropriate to dial down the grit hype and treat this construct like any other psychological measure – of potential interest, but unlikely to be the breakthrough that changes society.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational models of neurons vary in their biological realism and level of detail, ranging from point neurons such as simple and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire and Izhikevich models to morphologically realistic conductance based multi-compartmental models. Multi-compartmental models often include representations of voltage and ligand gated ion channels; these can be modelled using (commonly) the Hodgkin-Huxley or (sometimes) the Markov formalism. In this talk, I will give a basic introduction to compartmental modelling of neurons and discuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is one of the foundations of computational neuroscience, having been published in a series of seminal articles in 1952 and leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Byte - The HBP blog: Roof luggage, raindrops and a theory of memory</title>
	<link>https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/roof-luggage-raindrops-and-a-theory-of-memory-2c617560996e?source=rss----8bf7660fc7aa---4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HBP web editor Greg Meylan talked to theoretical neuroscientist Dr Misha Tsodyks about his first principles approach to understanding memory recall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after I spoke to Misha Tsodyks I was standing at a pedestrian crossing in the bright Geneva sunlight waiting for the lights to change. My mind was idling, memory circuits ready to fire at the smallest provocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5IhOX8qxItFW2F-MSmeLxQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Remember, this may not be the most aerodynamic way to attach a car roof-box. Photo courtesy dave_7/Flickr.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A car with a roof-box turned in front of me. As my eyes followed its movement, the shape of the roof-box ran down my neural pathways and hit upon a memory: of my friend’s father, an idiosyncratic hydrologist with a fine knowledge of fluid dynamics. He always attached his roof box the other way round to everyone else — with the flat end facing forward and the slope at the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More like the shape of a falling raindrop, I thought. Then I remembered that the classic raindrop shape is not a true depiction (see below). I’d read somewhere what shape raindrops actually take on their descent to earth, but I couldn’t recall exactly what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From car roof-box to raindrop. This was my memory firing, flitting from one thing to the next, sparked by the random passing of a car. Which was pretty much how Tsodyks had described his theories of memory recall to me the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his collaborators Mikhail Katkov and Sandro Romani, Tsodyks recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2817%2930292-1&quot;&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; that sought to demonstrate a first principles approach to understanding memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper provides a framework for how memories are triggered sequentially. When one set of neurons in a memory network is activated, it triggers the retrieval of the next item. The stronger the connections between two given memory networks, the more likely one will trigger the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory is based on two principles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. An encoding principle, which states that an item is encoded in the brain by a specific group of neurons in a dedicated memory network. When it is recalled, this specific group of neurons is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The associativity principle, which states that in the absence of sensory cues, a retrieved item plays the role of an internal cue that triggers the retrieval of the next item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/506/1*lHOcqaSETEGBTsG-uu4RJw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Three Steps of Retrieval Process. Each memory item in a list of four is represented by a randomly chosen population of neurons, here illustrated by blue circles. The size of the circle reflects the number of neurons representing a given item; the size of the overlap between the circles (darker area) reflects the number of neurons representing two given items. An arrow shows one retrieval step from one recalled item to the next chosen according to the size of the overlaps. Image and caption courtesy Misha Tsodyks/&lt;em&gt;Neuron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Neuron &lt;/em&gt;paper describes the process in what Tsodyks says is fairly simple mathematics. The value of this description is that it can produce predictable, testable results, something which is fairly rare in this area of neuroscience, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The surprising thing is that by applying it in an analytical framework, you get really clear predictions. If you are trying to remember something that has no structure, e.g. a list of words, or the movies you have watched, and if you apply this idea of sequential triggering, then you can predict how many things you are going to remember out of a list of a certain size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tested against &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_recall&quot;&gt;classic free recall&lt;/a&gt; experiments Tsodyks’ formula produced results close to those observed. Further experiments are planned, and Tsodyks is hopeful that the theory will hold. One of the surprising predictions of the model was that each word participants were exposed to in the free recall experiment had an intrinsic recall probability. Furthermore, the retrieval of easy words leads to a reduction of the overall number of retrieved words, due to the circuits following strong connections around in a circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because memory is so important to how the brain functions, Tsodyks believes theories of its processes will help in other areas. Indeed, he sees no fundamental difference between memory, thought or talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think thinking and talking are memory recall. The way I think about it is that thinking and talking are actually the same process. Because the way I think it works is that every thought you have is the signal for the next, every idea is linked to another one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Neuroscience, there is nothing you can really predict. We do not know how things really work, and the brain is so complex. Both these things mean you cannot make quantitative predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical world is the same, he says; for example, you cannot predict temperature of the sun. But you can simplify it, and with basic rules you can predict things like how long it takes a ball to fall. His paper on first principles seeks to provide a similar framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; paper says: “Despite thousands of years of astronomical observations, a clear picture unifying the motion of celestial objects appeared only after the formulation of a very few basic principles, known as Newton’s laws.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory should be able accommodate more biologically realistic mechanisms and representations, says Tsodyks, with the possibility of still deeper explanatory powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ve looked up what a rain drop looks like. It looks a bit like a hamburger bun, flat on the bottom and curved on top. This description is now entangled in a memory circuit that should forever overlap with roof boxes, my friend’s father, and a theory on memory itself. If the theory holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Misha Tsodyks works at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. He is part of the HBP’s neuroscience team, whose theories help inform the work of other areas of the HBP such as brain simulation, neuromorphic computing and neurorobotics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=2c617560996e&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/roof-luggage-raindrops-and-a-theory-of-memory-2c617560996e&quot;&gt;Roof luggage, raindrops and a theory of memory&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog&quot;&gt;Brain Byte Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf&quot;&gt;Extreme Male Brain theory of autism&lt;/a&gt;, there are certain cognitive and behavioural characteristics that manifest more often in men than women, on average, such as a bias for systematic rather than empathic thinking. Autism can be seen as as extreme version of that typical male profile, the theory proposes, possibly caused by prenatal &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/01/21/fetal-exposure-to-testosterone-linked-with-presence-of-autistic-traits-in-childhood/&quot;&gt;exposure to higher than usual amounts of testosterone in the womb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related observation is that exposure to high concentrations of prenatal testosterone leads to the development of “hyper masculine” facial features. It follows that if the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism is accurate, then autistic people will have hypermasculine faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09939-y&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; put this logic to the test, and consistent with the Extreme Male Brain theory, found that autistic girls and boys had more masculine faces as compared with neurotypical control children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29894&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research into whether autistic people tend to have stereotypically masculine facial features has been mixed. Women with sub-clinical autistic traits or a diagnosis of autism have been found to have more masculine than average faces, but studies with autistic men have sometimes found no difference from controls, or they’ve found the autistic men to have androgynous rather than hyper masculine features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new paper, the research team led by Diana Tan at the University of Western Australia, deliberately sought to test pre-pubescent autistic and neurotypical children, thus removing the possibility that hormonal changes during puberty might conceal or reverse any facial signs of prenatal exposure to high testosterone levels (as may have been the case in the earlier research involving adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan and her colleagues also employed a new 3D facial mapping process, tested on 48 neurotypical boys and 53 neurotypical girls, to provide a highly accurate and objective measure of the facial features that most typify a male and female child’s face. Using these features, the researchers’ algorithm was able to correctly categorise the sex of children’s faces with around 98 per cent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers deployed their 3D facial mapping algorithm to score the facial features of 54 caucasian autistic boys, 20 caucasian autistic girls and age-matched neurotypical caucasian boys and girls. This showed that the autistic boys and girls had more masculine than usual faces – to use the researchers’ jargon, their faces were hypermasculinised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when the researchers compared the autistic children and control children’s faces on the six facial features (mostly related to the positioning of the nose and upper lip) that most strongly distinguished neurotypcial boys’ faces from girls’ faces, the autistic kids of both sexes were found to have a more masculine score than controls on five of these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, among the autistic boys and girls, the more masculinised their faces, the more social and communication difficulties they tended to have, as scored in their diagnostic test for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample sizes for this study were relatively small, but the study’s biggest weakness is that it asks us to make a logical leap – high prenatal testosterone levels are known to cause faces to appear more masculine, autistic children have more masculine than average faces (as shown by the new results), &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; high prenatal testosterone levels contribute to autism (in line with the Extreme Male Brain Theory). However, as the researchers’ themselves acknowledge, this study featured no data on the testosterone levels that the children were exposed to prenatally, meaning there could be other explanations for the results. “Further investigation that tracks longitudinal links between early testosterone exposure, postnatal facial morphology and autism phenotype will provide more direct tests of the hypothesised relationships,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Extreme Male Brain theory has inspired important research into the causes of autism, but it has also been controversial. Cordelia Fine, the author of &lt;em&gt;Delusions of Gender&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Testosterone Rex&lt;/em&gt;, cites the theory as an example of contemporary “neurosexism”. And other recent research has uncovered findings that are inconsistent with the theory – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/1002/2224225/Sex-differences-in-autism-a-resting-state-fMRI&quot;&gt;last year a brain imaging study found that&lt;/a&gt;, compared with male neurotypical controls, autistic boys and men had resting connectivity patterns that resembled what’s more typically seen in women, while autistic girls and women showed a more masculine neurological profile, lending support “to the notion that autistic spectrum disorder may constitute a disorder of sexual differentiation or androgeny rather than a disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Socio-economic disadvantage and cancer survival disparities</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/Sydney_skyline_from_the_north_aerial_2010-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of cancer, people are not all equal. An individual’s likelihood of survival following a cancer diagnosis depends on many factors. These include tumor characteristics, such as site, size and spread; demographic factors such as age; but also where people are born and live along with the conditions of daily life – the so called social determinants of health. This broader environment impacts on how healthy our lives are, how early cancer is detected and what kind of treatment we receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined comparative cancer survival in New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, over a 30-year period and identified higher risk of cancer death for those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas and outside major cities. These survival disparities remained when we took into account differences in age, cancer stage at diagnosis, potential other causes of deaths, and differences in cancer site between population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disparities in cancer survival may be explained by factors that we cannot easily measure when using data from cancer registries. Factors that our study could not take into consideration included comorbidities, health behaviors, social support, and clinical cancer care. These factors are likely to impact overall cancer survival and any survival differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment is an important factor to consider when assessing cancer survival differences. There is evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491311&quot;&gt;disadvantaged population groups may receive less optimal treatment&lt;/a&gt;. New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we could not determine how much survival differences found in our study were driven by varied access to and/or quality of treatment, a universal health care system is expected to diminish some differences in health status between population groups. Despite the universal health care system in Australia, people with lower socio-economic status had worse cancer outcomes in NSW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from our study are unlikely to be specific to NSW or Australia. In fact, the association between lower socio-economic status and lower cancer survival has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999326&quot;&gt;demonstrated in several countries&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20717112&quot;&gt;other countries which also have universal health coverage and extensive social safety nets&lt;/a&gt;. This further highlights that cancer survival disparities are not entirely explained, nor fixed, by health care system related factors; a broader socio-economic context appears to be exerting an influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NSW, the comparative risk of cancer death in people living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas has increased over time. Cancer survival has improved over time for everyone but it seems that improvements have been greater or happened more quickly for well-off people, and consequently the survival gap has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer survival in migrants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined cancer survival by migrant status and grouped people based on their country of birth into those from English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. Australia has a large migrant population with more than a quarter of the population born outside Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrant groups may be disadvantaged in terms of health outcomes due to cultural, linguistic and health literacy barriers. However, according to our results, people born in other English-speaking countries had a similar risk, and those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our results … those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps surprising especially if we assume that language skills are associated with capacity to navigate through the health system, and that these navigation skills translate into better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that better survival in people born in non-English speaking countries is partly artefactual. Migrants are commonly healthier than the general population (so called ‘healthy migrant’ effect). They may also return to their home countries for the final stages of their life, so that information about their deaths won’t be recorded in the country where they were diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703888&quot;&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that people born outside Australia had slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, loss to follow-up appears to be a plausible explanation for recorded cancer survival advantage for some migrant groups in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic disadvantage is a complex concept with no consensus on how best to measure it. Several factors, including education, income, employment and family background have differing and likely culture-dependent effects on a person’s socio-economic status. We measured socio-economic disadvantage using an area-based measure which may not correspond to individual’s social class or position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to develop targeted actions and interventions, a more in-depth understanding of reasons driving socio-economic differences in cancer survival is needed. Such factors are likely to lie outside the direct responsibility of the health sector. Therefore, properly resourced and co-ordinated input from service providers from different sectors is essential for closing the socio-economic cancer survival gap.&lt;/p&gt;
