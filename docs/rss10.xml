	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Hold Negative Views About Those Who Believe Life Is Meaningless</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/29/people-hold-negative-views-about-those-who-believe-life-is-meaningless/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless,” wrote Leo Tolstoy in &lt;em&gt;A Confession&lt;/em&gt;, a succinct summing up of the nihilist worldview. Depressing as it may be, nihilism seems to be on the rise, with the importance of finding a meaningful worldview &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0027408&quot;&gt;steadily decreasing&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do other people &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; nihilists? This is the question posed by Matthew J. Scott and Adam B. Cohen of Arizona State University &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;in a new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. They find that stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative — and unlike stereotypes about atheists, people don’t seem to have any positive views about nihilists at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41939&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 464 participants viewed a short profile of either a fictitious man or woman, containing a picture and some information including occupation, favourite foods, hobbies, and preference for cats or dogs. The profile also outlined the person’s “pet philosophy”: they either had a nihilistic outlook (“We are here because of random events. Our lives have no purpose”) or a meaningful outlook (“We are all here for a reason. All of our lives serve a purpose”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated how much the person embodied certain traits: the Big Five personality traits, “folk social value traits” which included “fun”, “energetic”, “educated”, and “trustworthy”, and the ability to fulfil social tasks including self-protection, being a good friend, attracting romantic partners, caring for family, and being interested in having children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Profiles that indicated life had a purpose were rated as more agreeable, conscientious, outgoing, and open-minded than nihilist profiles, which were in turn considered more neurotic. Similarly, the folk social value traits were all more closely associated with meaningful profiles than they were with nihilist profiles. Nihilists were also considered less competent in all social tasks except for self-protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found that participants viewed nihilists as less religious, more depressed, and less likely to plan for the future — and that these perceptions could go some way to explaining why they had more negative views of nihilists than of those with a more meaningful outlook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study, involving 312 undergraduate participants, replicated the first, and came to many of the same conclusions. This time, the team also found that people had negative views of nihilists no matter what their own beliefs were on the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In three final studies, instead of using profiles of people who were or weren’t nihilists, the team showed participants profiles of people who were described as religious or non-religious, depressed or happy, or good or bad at future planning. Each of these factors was associated with negative judgements: among other findings, non-religious profiles were considered less socially competent and less conscientious; depressed profiles were seen as less extraverted and agreeable, and less able to avoid disease, attract romantic partners and look after children; and those with lower levels of future-planning were seen as less conscientious, less virtuous, and less intelligent, and less likely to be able to care for themselves and others. Together, the results of the final studies suggests that these three factors are indeed the key reason nihilists are negatively stereotyped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results don’t paint a rosy picture when it comes to views of nihilists. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/01/americans-simultaneously-hold-both-positive-and-negative-stereotypes-about-atheists/&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; on atheism, which found both positive and negative stereotypes of the non-religious, there also seems to be very little upside to the results — compared to people who think life has meaning, nihilists were viewed more negatively across the board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at different kinds of nihilism might produce different results, however — the team uses the example of someone who finds the accumulation of wealth meaningless, which may come with more positive stereotypes. It’s also perfectly possible that someone might believe life itself has no inherent purpose but has nonetheless developed their own sense of meaning. Looking more closely at people’s personal webs of meaning may reveal more nuanced attitudes, challenging broader stereotypes of how a “nihilist” thinks, feels, and behaves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;Stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An increasing volume of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accounts for the majority of recent surges in the global NCD burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, increasing humanitarian crises in LMICs have resulted in the global forced displacement of people reaching record highs, with the average length of displacement now greater than 20 years. Until recently, the problem of NCDs in conflict-affected populations was largely neglected. However, with growing awareness of the challenges NCDs represent in humanitarian settings, clinical guidance has been developed for chronic NCD care in LMICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/em&gt; (MSF)&lt;/a&gt; has supported the Jordanian health system by providing multidisciplinary, primary level NCD care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians living in Irbid, Jordan. This week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06333-3&quot;&gt;Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;describe their experiences with MSF, adapting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.re-aim.org/about/what-is-re-aim/&quot;&gt;RE-AIM framework&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate MSF’s program of NCD care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE-AIM is a framework consisting of five elements, &lt;em&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;. The framework was originally developed to encourage program planners, evaluators, funders, and policy-makers to be more attentive to essential program elements, to improve sustainable adoption, and promote the implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions. In this study, through the use of mixed methods, Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; examined the RE-AIM five key elements of the MSF Syrian refugee NCD program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12355&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12355 size-full&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/RE-AIM_resized-e1619620846606.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00143/full&quot;&gt;Ory &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most areas of the program were viewed as acceptable to patients, staff, and stakeholders. Although the care was free, patients were burdened with indirect costs, like paying for transport, to attend clinics, potentially outweighing the benefits of ‘free’ care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program achieved good clinical outcomes for treating patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, more research in the future that uses longer follow-up periods is needed to understand the prevalence or outcomes of major complications of NCDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for implementation was the impact of Syrian patients’ experiences of war, loss, and social suffering on their engagement with NCD care. Staff also shared concerns that they could not manage medical problems in isolation from the psychosocial issues patients faced and they felt ill-equipped to handle patients’ war-related trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients and staff also reported that the referral pathways for specialist services were troublesome and confusing. Funding for specialist referral pathways was limited, even though MSF managed to secure additional funding. This highlights the need for future programs to securely implement specialist referral pathways, ensuring they are designed to be affordable and accessible from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for maintaining the program was cost. High costs were partly responsible for the program’s limited coverage and scope. However, there is room for adaptations. For example, MSF introduced nurse task sharing, which could lead to cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge here is the availability of highly qualified family medicine specialists, for the management of patients with complex needs. While MSF had access to a large number of highly qualified Jordanian staff on this occasion, this is often not the case in all humanitarian crisis settings. This issue is difficult to address, but the authors propose potential workarounds, like telemedicine, as a possible solution for future programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12357 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-_unsplash_strip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in humanitarian crisis settings is extremely difficult. Not only do governments and humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in effectively tackling NCDs in LMICs, but the evaluation of interventions in humanitarian settings is equally as challenging. Still, this study demonstrated that RE-AIM is a valuable tool to guide complex interventions in humanitarian crisis settings. Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; bridge a knowledge gap in the delivery of care in humanitarian settings, however, more research is urgently needed to strengthen responses to NCDs in humanitarian crisis settings. Future programs need to focus on simplifying care models, reducing costs, and harnessing telehealth resources.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A clock’s accuracy may be tied to the entropy it creates</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clock-time-accuracy-entropy-disorder</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today’s most advanced clocks keep time with an incredibly precise rhythm. But a new experiment suggests that clocks’ precision comes at a price: entropy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entropy, or disorder, is created each time a clock ticks. Now, scientists have measured the entropy generated by a clock that can be run at varying levels of accuracy. The more accurate the clock’s ticks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/20079K7fGb41fc0c851061651bfded6801b0de3e0&quot;&gt;the more entropy it emitted&lt;/a&gt;, physicists report in a paper accepted to &lt;em&gt;Physical Review X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you want a better clock, you have to pay for it,” says physicist Natalia Ares of the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time and entropy are closely intertwined concepts. Entropy is known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arrow-time&quot;&gt;arrow of time&lt;/a&gt;,” because entropy tends to grow as time passes — the universe seems to consistently move from lower entropy to higher entropy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/15&lt;/em&gt;). This march toward increasing entropy explains why some processes can proceed forward in time but not in reverse: It’s easy to mix cream into coffee but exceedingly difficult to separate it again. Machines also increase disorder as they operate, for example by giving off heat that boosts the entropy of their surroundings. That means even a standard, battery-powered clock produces entropy as it ticks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Physicists had previously calculated that, for tiny quantum clocks, there’s a direct relationship between the maximum possible accuracy of their ticks and the amount of entropy emitted. But larger clocks are too complex for such calculations. So it wasn’t clear if such a rule held for other types of clocks, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test how much entropy was released in the ticking of a simplified clock, Ares and colleagues made a clock from a thin membrane, tens of nanometers thick and 1.5 millimeters long, suspended across two posts. An electrical signal sent into the clock jostled the membrane, causing it to flex up and down. This bending motion repeated at regular intervals, like the steady ticks of a clock, and an antenna registered that motion. The more powerful the electrical signal was, the more accurately the clock ticked. And as the clock’s accuracy increased, the entropy — a result of heat produced in the antenna’s circuit — increased in lockstep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That result suggests that the theoretical relationship for quantum clocks also applies to other types of clocks. “It’s nice to have that,” says physicist Juan Parrondo of the Complutense University of Madrid, who was not involved with the study. “What I’m not so sure of is how universal is this type of relationship that they find.” The researchers studied only one variety of clock. It’s not yet clear whether the relationship between accuracy and entropy applies to clocks more generally, Parrondo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some scientists suspect the relationship may be universal, revealing a fundamental aspect of how clocks function. The new study “would push us even more in this direction,” says quantum physicist Ralph Silva of ETH Zurich, who was not involved with the research. “It’s a data point in favor that it’s probably the case for all clocks. But that’s not been proven.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order for a clock to operate reliably, it must undergo a process that has a preferred direction in time. If the clock didn’t create entropy, it would be just as likely to run forward as backward. And the more entropy the clock creates, the less likely it is that the clockwork will suffer from fluctuations — temporary backward steps that would degrade its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if the accuracy of all clocks does come at a cost of increased entropy, that trade-off may reflect a close link between the passage of time and its measurement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper &quot;Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Climate change may have changed the direction of the North Pole’s drift</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-north-pole-drift-direction-earth-axis</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A sudden zag in which way the North Pole was drifting in the 1990s probably stemmed in large part from glacial melt caused by climate change, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The locations of Earth’s geographic poles, where the planet’s axis pierces the surface, aren’t fixed. Instead, they wander in seasonal and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solving-one-mystery-polar-wander&quot;&gt;near-annual cycles&lt;/a&gt;, largely driven by weather patterns and ocean currents (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/15/03&lt;/em&gt;). But in addition to moving about in relatively tight swirls just a few meters across, the poles drift over time as the planet’s weight distribution shifts and alters its rotation around its axis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the mid-1990s, the North Pole had been drifting toward the western edge of Canada’s Ellesmere Island. But then the pole veered eastward by about 71 degrees toward the northeastern tip of Greenland. It’s continued to head that way, moving about 10 centimeters per year. Scientists aren’t quite sure why this shift occurred, says Suxia Liu, a hydrologist at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Liu and colleagues checked how well the polar drift trends matched data from previous studies on glacial melt worldwide. In particular, glacier melt in Alaska, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change&quot;&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and the southern Andes accelerated in the 1990s (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/30/20&lt;/em&gt;). The timing of that melting, as well as the effects it would have had on Earth’s mass distribution, suggests that glacial melt induced by climate change helped trigger the change in polar drift, the team reports in the April 16 &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis shows that while glacier melting can account for much of the change in polar drift, it doesn’t explain all of it. So other factors must be at play. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/too-much-groundwater-pumping-draining-many-earth-rivers&quot;&gt;copious irrigation&lt;/a&gt;, for example, groundwater pumped from aquifers in one region can end up in an ocean far away (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/9/19&lt;/em&gt;). Like glacial melt, water management alone can’t explain the North Pole’s tack, the team reports, but it can give the Earth’s axis a substantial nudge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings “reveal how much human activity can have an impact on changes to the mass of water stored on land,” says Vincent Humphrey, a climate scientist at the University of Zurich not involved in this study. And they show how large these mass shifts can be, he says. “They’re so big that they can change the axis of the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Passion Is Linked To Greater Academic Achievement — But In Some Cultures More Than Others</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/28/passion-is-linked-to-greater-academic-achievement-but-in-some-cultures-more-than-others/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Passion” is a word that often crops up on job descriptions and in interviews; articles proliferate online explaining how to adequately express your passion to potential employers. On the whole, passionate people — those who have a strong interest in a particular topic, who are confident in themselves and who dedicate themselves to what they’re doing — are thought of in a positive light, and considered likely to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to predicting achievement, how important is passion really? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;According to Xingyu Li from Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, writing in&lt;em&gt; PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, passion may be less important in certain cultures — and the fact that passion is often seen as the key to achievement may reflect a “distinctly Western model of motivation”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41921&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chief factor explored in the study was how individualistic a society was: in individualistic cultures, the team argues, people are more motivated by pursuing paths related to their passions, while those in collectivistic cultures are more likely to see themselves as part of an interdependent network, often fulfilling obligations to others rather than focusing on their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from a large international survey focusing on education, which included over 1.2 million participants from nearly sixty different countries. The survey measured academic achievement in maths, science and reading during several closed-book tests, and the team also examined the individualism or collectivism of each culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passion itself is hard to measure across cultures — some participant languages, including Mandarin, have no direct translation for the word as understood in the Western world. Instead, passion was measured through self-report answers on various different factors: passionate students were those who were strongly and independently motivated and who showed high levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In science subjects, passion &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;positively correlated with academic achievement: those with higher levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy also had higher test scores. But the strength of this correlation wasn’t the same across cultures: those in individualistic societies such as the US, Australia, and the UK showed a stronger link between passion and achievement than did those in more collectivistic societies such as Colombia or Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results were also mirrored in achievement in both mathematics and in reading — again, high-achieving participants from more individualistic societies were also more likely to have high levels of passion, whilst high-achieving participants from collectivistic societies were not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to check whether any other cultural differences could predict the link between passion and achievement, the team also looked at eight further factors that vary between cultures, including how likely people are to avoid uncertainty, whether they value simple survival over self-expression, and how indulgent they are. However, only differences in individualism vs. collectivism could explain the association between passion and achievement across cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from the results that passion isn’t the only thing that motivates people to achieve their goals — indeed, the team also found that parental support was a crucial factor in achievement in collectivistic societies. And these findings could help with the development of educational support programmes that cater to a wider range of individuals. Rather than developing support that focuses solely on self-regulation and passion, for example, institutions could take a wider view of what motivates students to do well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that one type of motivation is no better than another. Although motivation from others could be seen as more extrinsic, the team writes, it “need not feel like coercive pressure from the outside”: rather than feeling overbearing, such motivation can be a source of “empowerment, persistence and resilience”. While for many students passion is key, it’s certainly worth considering the other factors that might make people tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;Passion matters but not equally everywhere: Predicting achievement from interest, enjoyment, and efficacy in 59 societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Both nuclei are typically subdivided into collections of smaller &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nuclei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the olivary nuclei and what do they do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior and superior olivary nuclei are distinct in function. The inferior olivary nucleus is typically subdivided into the &lt;em&gt;principal olive, medial accessory olive, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;dorsal accessary olive&lt;/em&gt;, and is thought to play an important role in movement, coordination, and movement-related learning. The superior olivary nucleus consists of the &lt;em&gt;lateral superior olive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;medial superior olive,&lt;/em&gt; as well as a number of surrounding nuclei known as the &lt;em&gt;periolivary nuclei&lt;/em&gt;. The superior olivary nuclei are thought to be involved in hearing, and specifically with identifying the location of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior olivary nuclei receive movement-related information from several sources, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/motor-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This includes information about current movement, body position, muscle tension, and intention. The inferior olivary nuclei use this information to communicate with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; to fine-tune movements and aid in movement-related learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlear&lt;/a&gt; nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior colliculus&lt;/a&gt;, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul MS, M Das J.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731&quot;&gt;Stevenson and Kording&lt;/a&gt; (2011), the authors estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;every 7.4 years, the number of neurons we can record with doubles&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as Moore’s law for brain recordings. Since then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;Stevenson has updated the estimate&lt;/a&gt;, which now stands at 6 years. Could it be that progress itself is accelerating? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218&quot;&gt;Matteo Carandini raised a question&lt;/a&gt;: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change&quot;&gt;a double-exponential curve&lt;/a&gt;: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Doubling times&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; /&gt;image &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot;&gt;CC BY Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662&quot;&gt;Urai et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt; – generously released under a CC-BY license – and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times&quot;&gt;code here&lt;/a&gt;). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It’s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature – 4.5 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7621&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7621&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-8&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;775,554&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8-2/&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=775&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A log-linear model of progress in electrophysiology&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers – hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that’s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can do one better – fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/&quot;&gt;PyMC3&lt;/a&gt; – a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here’s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7617&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7617&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;779,527&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time – and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7619&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7619&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-7&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;752,555&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-7-2/&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=752&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 – of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7623&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7623&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-9&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;783,527&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-9/&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=783&quot; width=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/&quot;&gt;including Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1&quot;&gt;adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors&lt;/a&gt; to electrophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, this generalized Moore’s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes – but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995&quot;&gt;and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time – perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain’t what it used to be, and it’s coming far faster than we’ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There’s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is – perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The thickness of lead’s neutron ‘skin’ has been precisely measured</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-thick-neutron-skin-atom-nucleus-new-measure-physics</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some atomic nuclei are thin-skinned — they’re surrounded by a slim shell of neutrons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicists now know how thick that neutron skin is for one particular type of nucleus. The skin of lead-208 — a variety of lead with 126 neutrons in addition to its 82 protons — is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.172502&quot;&gt;0.28 trillionths of a millimeter thick&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online April 27 in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lead-208’s nucleus is approximately spherical, a ball of protons embedded within a slightly bigger ball of neutrons. Measuring the difference between the sizes of the spheres reveals the thickness of lead’s sleek neutron skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gauging the size of the proton sphere is relatively straightforward: Physicists can shoot electrically charged particles at the nucleus and study how the particles scatter away from the positively charged protons. But because neutrons don’t have an electric charge, the volume they enclose is harder to measure.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So researchers with the Lead Radius Experiment, or PREX-II, at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Va., used a special technique. The team measured how electrons scattered differently from the nucleus according to their spin, or angular momentum. Because electrons interact with neutrons at different rates depending on the direction of their spin, the experiment revealed the width of the neutron sphere, allowing researchers to calculate the neutron skin thickness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The neutron skin was slightly thicker than physicists had predicted. That’s a result that “makes everyone sit up and pay attention and start to question one’s assumptions,” says physicist and PREX-II co-spokesperson Krishna Kumar of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A future measurement will test the skin of another nucleus, calcium-48. Together the measurements could help scientists better understand theories of the atomic nucleus and other realms where neutrons are crammed together such as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-stars-pulsar-density-diameter-matter&quot;&gt;neutron stars&lt;/a&gt;, extremely dense, dead stars composed mainly of neutrons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: To boldly grow: five new journals shaped by Open Science</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FJ2pmGTKCuU/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;PLOS announces new journals&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18866&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;1120&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are extremely excited to announce the imminent launch of &lt;strong&gt;five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;, our first new launches in fourteen years. These new journals are unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges and are rooted in the full values of Open Science:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, before we go on, let’s address this: “Yet more journals?” (Yes, we heard you…!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. We set out, with our original &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/submit/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven journals&lt;/a&gt;, to transform research communication by making research content openly accessible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Over the eighteen years since our first journal launch&lt;/a&gt; we’ve helped prove the viability of Open Access which, despite the occasional disagreement about how best to achieve it, is now a mainstream notion. We changed the publishing landscape via &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, and this new type of “mega-journal” now features at almost every publisher and in every research field. We helped focus the conversation about peer review on rigor and transparency, and more people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions. And, via open data policies, open peer review options, protocols, preregistration, preprint facilitation, etc., we’ve worked towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the &lt;strong&gt;entire research communication process&lt;/strong&gt;, not just our journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that we do not take lightly the responsibility of introducing new journals into the world. While we don’t believe the long-term future of research communication is always going to be the journal as we know it today, we do appreciate the impacts that journals can still have, and the new &lt;strong&gt;communities of practice &lt;/strong&gt;they can empower. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we are launching these five journals in the spirit of them being additional &lt;strong&gt;change-making vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve invited key members of the PLOS Leadership Team along with our CEO, Alison Mudditt, to field specific questions, below: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why launch new journals at this point in PLOS’ journey?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niamh O’Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re a nonprofit, driven by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/dei/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, and we need to adapt to continue to deliver on it. Even though Open Access is now widely adopted, and Open Science is advancing, there are still key voices missing. We are expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers. Researchers have always driven our mission forward, and in order for us to have a meaningful impact we need to include the broadest range of their voices, globally. This way, we ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. These new journals create new and diverse communities of practice, and ensure that they are at the forefront of shaping how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all these journals will be underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. Our existing institutional models are our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing (CAP)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreement&lt;/a&gt; models. We’ll talk more about our brand new models when the journals open for submissions, suffice to say that they are also not based on APCs. With all this said, author fee-based models will still be available for those authors who prefer or need them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are the special characteristics of these new journals?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Shanahan, Publishing Director, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Niamh says, our next phase of work is not just about Open Access. These new journals not only complement and naturally extend the existing PLOS suite of journals, but will hardwire a lens of social responsibility into sharing research. Via these new journals we can work together to address the most pressing ‘Openness’ issue specific to each field, and enable the researchers addressing these challenges, everywhere, to have the broadest impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In full alignment with the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, these titles will ensure diversity and equity of representation at all levels – editors, editorial boards, reviewers, authors – and will actively seek out research from under-represented communities. The journals will play a part in broader efforts to create a more equitable system of knowledge-sharing, accelerating and increasing the benefits of scientific endeavour for global society as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new journals all focus on some of the world’s most globally-relevant issues, to which locally-relevant research can, and must, become more visible. This approach will directly challenge the unfortunate norm that most ‘global’ forums remain dominated by research from Western Europe and North America.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How will these journals contribute to the increased adoption of Open Science practices?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has always led on key Open Science matters, we are experimenters, but we’re also striving to be better listeners. We know a rigid approach to Open Science won’t foster equitable participation from all communities. As a publisher, we’ve never been driven by tradition, but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can understand and improve the system. We’ll continue to investigate and test new ways of sharing, assessing, and recognizing research. We’ll be partnering with leaders across research communities, and the Open Science communities, to enact change. Not every solution will be journal-shaped, but all our journals will be shaped by Open Science, enabling those who publish with us to join communities of practice. We can use our newly expanded journal portfolio to influence norms and advance Open Science practices in considered and appropriate ways. We stand firm on any policies like open data that promote rigor and advance trust in research, but we want to understand the specific challenges that such policies represent for new communities, and work with them to find solutions that empower them, in their contexts, to practice Open Science. Overall, we want to further empower new communities to join us and inform us, working more tightly together towards ever more trust in science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How does this expansion of the portfolio fit into PLOS’ wider aims for the future?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has grown, times have changed, and how we deliver our mission has to evolve. Science is a global, collaborative enterprise. Challenging times help us see where we are and where we need to be. Global collaboration, transparency, and trust in science (and policies…and interventions…)  have all become recurring themes. We’re also coming to terms with how we, as a society, need to do a lot more to address systemic barriers to inclusion. How we think of ourselves as an organization, especially a research communication organization, isn’t separate from everything else going on in the world today. We have always worked to raise the bar for Openness. To continue this work we need to continue to grow – but not just in the traditional business sense, and not just in counting the number of journals we publish: we also need to, and have concrete plans to, spread our roots deeper, create more global hubs for PLOS, absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business, and, as others commented before me, ensure that any journal we publish is informed by local communities at a global scale, challenging problems, and rebuilding the system better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch these spaces!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have Editors in place, we have dedicated staff, and the journals will open for submissions a little later this year. All updated information will appear on the respective journal websites (linked from the list above) as the journals take shape. Visit them often for submission guidelines, how our editorial boards are developing, how to apply to be a member of the board, where to follow them on social media, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: COVID-19 can affect the brain. New clues hint at how</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-coronavirus-symptom-stroke-anxiety-depression</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than a year now, scientists have been racing to understand how the mysterious new virus that causes COVID-19 damages not only our bodies, but also our brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, some infected people noticed a curious symptom: the loss of smell. Reports of other brain-related symptoms followed: headaches, confusion, hallucinations and delirium. Some infections were accompanied by depression, anxiety and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that leaky blood vessels and inflammation are somehow involved in these symptoms. But many basic questions remain unanswered about the virus, which has infected more than 145 million people worldwide. Researchers are still trying to figure out how many people experience these psychiatric or neurological problems, who is most at risk, and how long such symptoms might last. And details remain unclear about how the pandemic-causing virus, called SARS-CoV-2, exerts its effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We still haven’t established what this virus does in the brain,” says Elyse Singer, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. There are probably many answers, she says. “It’s going to take us years to tease this apart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Getting the numbers&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, some scientists are focusing on the basics, including how many people experience these sorts of brain-related problems after COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study of electronic health records reported an alarming answer: In the six months after an infection, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00084-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;one in three people had experienced a psychiatric or neurological diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. That result, published April 6 in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, came from the health records of more than 236,000 COVID-19 survivors. Researchers counted diagnoses of 14 disorders, ranging from mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression to neurological events such as strokes or brain bleeds, in the six months after COVID-19 infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t expect it to be such a high number,” says study coauthor Maxime Taquet of the University of Oxford in England. One in three “might sound scary,” he says. But it’s not clear whether the virus itself causes these disorders directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of those diagnoses were depression and anxiety, “disorders that are extremely common in the general population already,” points out Jonathan Rogers, a psychiatrist at University College London. What’s more, depression and anxiety are on the rise among everyone during the pandemic, not just people infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental health disorders are “extremely important things to address,” says Allison Navis, a neurologist at the post-COVID clinic at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “But they’re very different than a stroke or dementia,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 50 people with COVID-19 had a stroke, Taquet and colleagues found. Among people with severe infections that came with delirium or other altered mental states, though, the incidence was much higher — 1 in 11 had strokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;scans of brains with strokes&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099126&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042221_ls_covid_brain_inline2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099126&quot;&gt;Serious neurological damage, such as these strokes caused by blocked blood vessels, turn up in people with COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099126&quot;&gt;K. Thakur &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taquet’s study comes with caveats. It was a look back at diagnosis codes, often entered by hurried clinicians. Those aren’t always reliable. And the study finds a relationship, but can’t conclude that COVID-19 caused any of the diagnoses. Still, the results hint at how COVID-19 affects the brain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Blood vessels scrutinized&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early on in the pandemic, the loss of smell suggested that the virus might be able to attack nerve cells directly. Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 could breach the skull by climbing along the olfactory nerve, which carries smells from the nose directly to the brain, some researchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That frightening scenario doesn’t seem to happen much. Most studies so far have failed to turn up much virus in the brain, if any, says Avindra Nath, a neurologist who studies central nervous system infections at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Nath and his colleagues expected to see signs of the virus in brains of people with COVID-19 but didn’t find it. “I kept telling our folks, ‘Let’s go look again,’” Nath says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That absence suggests that the virus is affecting the brain in other ways, possibly involving blood vessels. So Nath and his team scanned blood vessels in post-mortem brains of people who had been infected with the virus with an MRI machine so powerful that it’s not approved for clinical use in living people. “We were able to look at the blood vessels in a way that nobody could,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2033369&quot;&gt;Damage abounded&lt;/a&gt;, the team reported February 4 in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Small clots sat in blood vessels. The walls of some vessels were unusually thick and inflamed. And blood was leaking out of the vessels into the surrounding brain tissue. “You can see all three things happening at the same time,” Nath says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those results suggest that clots, inflamed linings and leaks in the barriers that normally keep blood and other harmful substances out of the brain may all contribute to COVID-related brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;left: inflamed immune cells around blood vessel. right: cells affected by COVID-19&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099125&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042221_ls_covid_brain_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099125&quot;&gt;Signs of damage in the brains of people with COVID-19 involve inflammation, including these immune cells around a blood vessel (left), and changes in cells (right) that might have resulted from low oxygen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099125&quot;&gt;J. Lou &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Free Neuropathology&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But several unknowns prevent any definite conclusions about how these damaged blood vessels relate to people’s symptoms or outcomes. There’s not much clinical information available about the people in Nath’s study. Some likely died from causes other than COVID-19, and no one knows how the virus would have affected them had they not died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Inflamed body and brain&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inflammation in the body can cause trouble in the brain, too, says Maura Boldrini, a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York. Inflammatory signals released after injury can change the way the brain makes and uses chemical signaling molecules, called neurotransmitters, that help nerve cells communicate. Key communication molecules such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine can get scrambled when there’s lots of inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neural messages can get interrupted in people who suffer traumatic brain injuries, for example; researchers have found a relationship between inflammation and mental illness in football players and others who experienced hits to the head.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar evidence comes from people with depression, says Emily Troyer, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego. Some people with depression have high levels of inflammation, studies have found. “We don’t actually know that that’s going on in COVID,” she cautions. “We just know that COVID causes inflammation, and inflammation has the potential to disrupt neurotransmission, particularly in the case of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the cells that release inflammatory proteins in the brain are microglia, the brain’s version of the body’s disease-fighting immune system. Microglia may also be involved in the brain’s response to COVID-19. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861505/&quot;&gt;Microglia primed for action&lt;/a&gt; were found in about 43 percent of 184 COVID-19 patients, Singer and others reported in a review published February 4 in&lt;em&gt; Free Neuropatholog&lt;/em&gt;y. Similar results come from a series of autopsies of COVID-19 patients’ brains; &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awab148/6226391&quot;&gt;34 of 41 brains contained activated microglia&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital reported April 15 in &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these findings, it’s not clear that SARS-CoV-2 affects people’s brains differently from other viruses, says Navis. In her post–COVID-19 clinic at Mount Sinai, she sees patients with fatigue, headaches, numbness and dizziness — symptoms that are known to follow other viral infections, too. “I’m hesitant to say this is unique to COVID,” Navis says. “We’re just not used to seeing so many people getting one specific infection, or knowing what the viral infection is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teasing apart all the ways the brain can suffer amid this pandemic, and how that affects any given person, is impossible. Depression and anxiety are on the rise, surveys suggest. That rise might be especially sharp in people who endured stressful diagnoses, illnesses and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;clotting protein in postmortem brain from person with COVID-19&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099127&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042321_ls_covid_brain_inline3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099127&quot;&gt;In a postmortem brain from a person with COVID-19, a clotting protein called fibrinogen (red) indicates that the blood vessels are damaged and leaky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099127&quot;&gt;Avindra Nath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just being in an intensive care unit can lead to confusion. Delirium affected 606 of 821 people — 74 percent — while patients were in intensive care units for respiratory failure and other serious emergencies, a 2013 study found. Post-traumatic stress disorder afflicted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-survivors-ptsd-mental-health&quot;&gt;about a third of people who had been seriously sick with COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/12/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specific aspects of treatment matter too. COVID-19 patients who spent long periods of time on their stomachs might have lingering nerve pain, not because the virus attacked the nerve, but because the prone position compressed the nerves. And people might feel mentally fuzzy, not because of the virus itself, but because a shortage of the anesthetic drug, propofol, meant they received an alternative sedative that can bring more aftereffects, says Rogers, the psychiatrist at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lingering questions — what the virus actually does to the brain, who will suffer the most, and for how long — are still unanswered, and probably won’t be for a long time. The varied and damaging effects of lockdowns, the imprecision doctors and patients use for describing symptoms (such as the nonmedical term “brain fog”) and the indirect effects the virus can have on the brain all merge, creating a devilishly complex puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, doctors are busy focusing on ways in which they can help, even amid these mysteries, and designing larger, longer studies to better understand the effects of the virus on the brain. That information will be key to helping people move forward. “This isn’t going to be over soon, unfortunately,” Troyer says.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Students With ADHD Aren’t Always Given The Support They Need To Thrive At University</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/27/students-with-adhd-arent-always-given-the-support-they-need-to-thrive-at-university/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doing well in educational settings can have huge advantages — better job prospects, higher wages, greater life satisfaction and more. Achievement at university isn’t always to do with how hard you work or how intelligent you are, however — first generation university students are more&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt; at risk of impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reducing their engagement in class, their attendance, and their overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for those with extra needs, university can offer all kinds of extra challenges, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2020.1867990&quot;&gt;as a new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychology&lt;/em&gt; makes clear. It finds that students with ADHD obtained significantly lower grades than those without the diagnosis, suggesting that academic and pastoral services are not going far enough to support neurodiverse students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41888&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 456 US-based students for a longitudinal study: at the first point, students were in their first year of university, with further participation each year for four years. Around half met criteria for ADHD, while the other half did not, and of those who met ADHD criteria half were taking medication. About 70% of students with ADHD and 85% of control participants completed all four assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure ADHD, participants were first asked to complete a self-report scale listing inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly seen in those with the diagnosis. They then took part in a semi-structured interview with the team, designed to explore severity and onset of symptoms, and in an online test designed to measure other potentially significant symptoms such as anxiety or low mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents of the students also filled in a scale indicating their child’s behaviour from the ages of five to twelve and in the six months prior to the study’s start. Using all of this data, a panel of psychologists with expertise in ADHD determined whether each student would be placed in the ADHD or non-ADHD group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the study, the team tracked several factors, including: grades (in the form of GPAs and either reported by the students or taken from university records); progress towards graduation, assessed through how many credits a student had accrued; and whether a student was still enrolled in university. The team also looked at study skills: how well were students engaging in learning strategies like tracking goals, self-testing, or managing their time efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that those in the ADHD cohort overall obtained significantly lower GPAs than those in the control cohort. Students with ADHD symptoms were also less likely to use study skills than their peers, and those who were not taking medication were also more likely to drop out of university altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other factors also had an impact on academic success: those with higher levels of executive functioning, who were more likely to be in the control group, were more likely to obtain higher GPAs and remain in education. Interestingly, those who engaged with university support services were also more likely to achieve academically, suggesting that universities could be doing more to reach those who need help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Helping students with executive functioning — which includes organisation skills, time management, paying attention and self-monitoring — could be one way of supporting them academically. They could also benefit from more support in wider study skills: how to successfully plan, structure, and complete an assignment, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incorporating strategies specifically designed to help neurodiverse students could also be key here. Students with depressive symptoms were also less likely to succeed; including mental health and wider pastoral support is also likely to have a big impact on students with ADHD. Results from the study suggest that isn’t always happening, though. The majority of students with ADHD received no support with academic skills, tailored tutoring or mentoring — only 19.7% received support with academic matters and 34% with tutoring. Universities may need to spend time reaching out to neurodiverse students or those facing other barriers, or risk creating an environment that makes it hard for all to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2020.1867990&quot;&gt;Academic Trajectories of College Students with and without ADHD: Predictors of Four-Year Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Stars made of antimatter could lurk in the Milky Way</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-stars-antistars-milky-way-galaxy-space-astronomy</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fourteen pinpricks of light on a gamma-ray map of the sky could fit the bill for antistars, stars made of antimatter, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These antistar candidates seem to give off the kind of gamma rays that are produced when antimatter — matter’s oppositely charged counterpart — meets normal matter and annihilates. This could happen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.083016&quot;&gt;the surfaces of antistars&lt;/a&gt; as their gravity draws in normal matter from interstellar space, researchers report online April 20 in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review D&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If, by any chance, one can prove the existence of the antistars … that would be a major blow for the standard cosmological model,” says Pierre Salati, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Annecy-le-Vieux Laboratory of Theoretical Physics in France not involved in the work. It “would really imply a significant change in our understanding of what happened in the early universe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s generally thought that although the universe was born with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, the modern universe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-axions-how-matter-conquered-universe&quot;&gt;contains almost no antimatter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). Physicists typically think that as the universe evolved, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mounting-evidence-suggests-neutrinos-are-key-why-antimatter-is-rare&quot;&gt;some process&lt;/a&gt; led to matter particles vastly outnumbering their antimatter alter egos (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/25/19&lt;/em&gt;). But an instrument on the International Space Station recently cast doubt on this assumption by detecting hints of a few antihelium nuclei. If those observations are confirmed, such stray antimatter could have been shed by antistars.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by the possibility that some of the universe’s antimatter may have survived in the form of stars, a team of researchers examined 10 years of observations from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Among nearly 5,800 gamma-ray sources in the catalog, 14 points of light gave off gamma rays with energies expected of matter-antimatter annihilation, but did not look like any other known type of gamma-ray source, such as a pulsar or black hole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the number of observed candidates and the sensitivity of the Fermi telescope, the team calculated how many antistars could exist in the solar neighborhood. If antistars existed within the plane of the Milky Way, where they could accrete lots of gas and dust made of ordinary matter, they could emit lots of gamma rays and be easy to spot. As a result, the handful of detected candidates would imply that only one antistar exists for every 400,000 normal stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, antistars tended to exist outside the plane of the galaxy, they would have much less opportunity to accrete normal matter and be much harder to find. In that scenario, there could be up to one antistar lurking among every 10 normal stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But proving that any celestial object is an antistar would be extremely difficult, because besides the gamma rays that could arise from matter-antimatter annihilation, the light given off by antistars is expected to look just like the light from normal stars. “It would be practically impossible to say that [the candidates] are actually antistars,” says study coauthor Simon Dupourqué, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France. “It would be much easier to disprove.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers could watch how gamma rays or radio signals from the candidates change over time to double-check that these objects aren’t really pulsars. Researchers could also look for optical or infrared signals that might indicate the candidates are actually black holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Obviously this is still preliminary … but it’s interesting,” says Julian Heeck, a physicist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The existence of antistars would imply that substantial amounts of antimatter somehow managed to survive in isolated pockets of space. But Heeck doubts that antistars, if they exist, would be abundant enough to account for all the universe’s missing antimatter. “You would still need an explanation for why matter overall dominates over antimatter.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: The MDAR Framework – a new tool for life sciences reporting</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1GkvF8JqjjU/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS note:&lt;/strong&gt; We are delighted to share this announcement by the MDAR Working Group &lt;strong&gt;(M&lt;/strong&gt;aterials, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;esign, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalysis, &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eporting)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of a new framework for transparent reporting in the life sciences. PLOS has always put emphasis—through editorial policies and submission guidelines—on complete and transparent reporting to facilitate the analysis, trust, reproduction and reuse of the research we publish. We’ve supported and participated in the MDAR Working Group by sharing our experience and helping to develop and test the new reporting framework. We hope that the MDAR Framework will help bring consistency to journals reporting guidelines and make it easier for authors to adopt transparency norms. The MDAR Framework is consistent with what is practiced at PLOS and we will work with our editorial boards to explore the most effective ways to implement it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incomplete or imprecise reporting of life sciences research contributes to challenges with reproducibility, replicability, and biomedical applications. For the last three years we – a group of journal editors and researchers – have been working together to develop a new framework for transparent reporting of life sciences research. This framework has just been &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118&quot;&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework establishes the four domains – research Materials, Design, Analysis, and Reporting – in which we define both a set of basic minimum requirements, and best practice recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were motivated to develop the MDAR Framework as part of our own and others’ attempts to improve reporting to drive research improvement and ultimately greater trust in science. Existing tools, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;ARRIVE &lt;/a&gt;guidelines, guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/&quot;&gt;FAIRSharing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR Network&lt;/a&gt;, speak to important sub-elements of biomedical research. This new MDAR Framework aims to be  more general and less deep, and therefore complements these important specialist guidelines.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous approaches have led to improved reporting, but often at considerable cost to both authors’ and editors’ time. A recent period of experimentation has resulted in a thorough but fragmented landscape of reporting guidelines for life science journals. A drive for efficiency  inspired us to learn from each other’s experiences and to harmonize the most effective practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework provides flexibility along with broad applicability. The standard articulation of expectations across different journals will make it easier for: (i) authors to better understand what is expected of them, and (ii) for more journals to adopt an established approach rather than develop it from scratch. Journals can choose a level of implementation appropriate to their needs, enabling greater adoption potential. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also hope that the MDAR Framework will be helpful for other organizations such as funders, who can signal reporting expectations early and therefore have an effect at the time the studies are designed, and tool/software developers, who can devise means of facilitating compliance for authors and journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the framework, the project provides a checklist (for authors, journals or reviewers) as an optional implementation tool, and an explanation and elaboration document. The checklist was piloted on over 289 manuscript submissions across 13 journals, seeking feedback from authors and editors actually using the checklist. Our team analysed agreement between observers, sought feedback from outside experts, and revised the framework in the light of this experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full set of MDAR resources will be maintained and updated as a community resource, in a Collection on the Open Science Framework. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are sharing this update on the MDAR Framework through coordinated posts on working group member platforms. Working group members have been free to add any additional context as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think back to the last time that you did some exercise. What exactly prompted you to get up and do it? Was it because it was scheduled? Or because you felt a strong urge to engage in some physical activity (or maybe a bit of both)?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, researchers have explored a person’s general disposition to exercise, and looked at strategies to increase their exercise levels over a week, a month, or longer. However, a team led by Matt Stults-Kolehmainen at Yale University, Yale-New Haven Hospital and Columbia University argues in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.568286/full&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; that it’s also crucial to consider transient changes in in-the-moment wants, desires and urges for physical activity and also rest. “Typically, we understand motivation as a more stable construct – e.g. ‘I am not motivated today’ — or a trait — ‘I am not a motivated person’. This new perspective views motivation &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;,” Stults-Kolehmainen says. And the team believes that by influencing these feelings, people can be encouraged to exercise more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41876&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568390/full&quot;&gt;initial work&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2020, the team explored the concept of considering motivational states for understanding why and when people exercise. In the new paper, they report on their creation of a new scale for assessing these states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their CRAVE (Cravings for Rest and Volitional Energy Expenditures) scale was developed using a series of studies on students and adult participants. The final version includes a total of 10 items that relate to physical activity (a desire to “move my body” or “exert my muscles”, for example) and also being sedentary (for example, a desire to “just sit down” or “do nothing active”.) Results from across the studies showed that these feelings can change rapidly. After a 50-minute lecture, for example, a group of students reported significantly higher in-the-moment “desire to move” scores — and lower ‘”desire to rest” scores — than beforehand; a separate group that was given a gruelling treadmill task showed the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These particular results might not sound surprising — but when it comes to strategies to help people to exercise more, the potential importance of these in-the-moment motivational states has been underestimated, the team thinks. A long period of sitting or a strenuous bout of exercise clearly influences these states, but other things could, too. As the researchers suggest, future studies should explore the potential influence of the time of day, for example, or an individual’s eating patterns. Some influences may also last longer: the team’s two-year study of a community group of adults, reported in the new paper, found that the participants’ in-the-moment motivation to move trended down over this period, while their motivation to rest trended up. “As such, more resources are needed to understand how desires might evolve over an extended period of time (e.g. seasonally, over years) and how they can be intervened upon,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the team hopes to see interventions that trigger or enhance immediate desires to exercise. Stults-Kolehmainen is optimistic about this. He gives this example: “Interestingly, just reading about wants or desires to move and be active might instigate wants/desires to move and be active — and humans are actually capable of perceiving this and, we believe, acting on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personally, I know that anytime I see anyone exercising in a movie (I’m thinking Sarah Connor, say, or even Rocky Balboa), I feel a real urge to exercise, too. If I could time that exposure to a point in the day when exercise was actually practical (rather than when I’m on the sofa with the kids), I could imagine it working to push me up and out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.568286/full&quot;&gt;Measurement of Motivation States for Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior: Development and Validation of the CRAVE Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: This praying mantis inflates a strange pheromone gland to lure mates</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/praying-mantis-pheromone-gland-mates</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Praying mantises — with their angular features, huge eyes and centaur posture — often seem a bit alien. But researchers have recently found one mantis species that takes this otherworldly quality to the next level: Females of this species have an inflatable pheromone gland that protrudes from the back of the abdomen like a green, Y-shaped balloon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This odd organ is unlike anything seen in mantises before, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3897/jor.30.55274&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; online April 21 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Orthoptera Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, herpetologist Frank Glaw was moving through the nighttime rainforest in Amazonian Peru at the Panguana research station, searching for amphibians and reptiles. His flashlight passed over a brown, leaf-mimicking mantis (&lt;em&gt;Stenophylla lobivertex&lt;/em&gt;) in the tangle of vegetation, and he saw “maggotlike” structures protruding from its back. Those structures were quickly sucked back inside the insect after the light hit it, says Glaw, of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glaw was reminded of “parasites that eat the animal from the inside,” having seen such fatally parasitized insects before. With the help of Christian Schwarz, an entomologist at Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany, and observations of some female specimens in captivity, the team figured out that the mantis was no parasite-riddled vessel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;close-up of a y-shaped gland on a mantis&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099018&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042221_jb_mantis-gland_inline_680-675x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099018&quot;&gt;The inflatable pheromone gland of &lt;em&gt;Stenophylla lobivertex&lt;/em&gt; (shown) may be highly efficient at spreading chemical signals throughout the rainforest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099018&quot;&gt;Christian J. Schwarz (CC-BY 4.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When left undisturbed in total darkness, the female mantises extrude a pronged structure inflated with body fluids, roughly the hue and luster of polished jade. It appears to be a highly modified gland for producing pheromones — chemical signals that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nighttime-light-pollution-sabotages-sex-pheromones-moths&quot;&gt;help female insects attract mates&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/15&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other mantises have simple, noninflatable glands that are located in the same section of abdomen as &lt;em&gt;S. lobivertex&lt;/em&gt;’s bifurcated contraption.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This mantis species is rarely encountered by researchers and might be thinly spread throughout the rainforest, so locating receptive mates could be particularly challenging. The researchers think a large, protrusible pheromone gland with lots of surface area could be a workaround, more efficiently dispersing pheromones to be detected by the antennae of would-be suitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a kind of chemical ‘dating app’ in the jungle,” says Glaw, noting that the observations “emphasize the importance of pheromones in [the mantises’] reproduction in a vivid manner.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Females in some other mantis species are known to expose a pink, patchlike gland when doing their chemical call for mates, says Henrique Rodrigues, an entomologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History who was not involved with this research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can easily see something like that being the precursor of the protrusible gland,” says Rodrigues. He notes that since males have thin, hairlike antennae, “the other way to increase the odds of mate finding would be for females to increase the amount of pheromone released.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glaw thinks it’s likely that similar glands might exist in the other two species of &lt;em&gt;Stenophylla&lt;/em&gt;, and possibly other mantises. “If this organ is really an important tool to improve the finding of mates,” he says, “it would be an advantage for many other mantis species as well and might be more widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

During the last 13 years of his life, Warhol put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29125003&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thousands of collected objects&lt;/a&gt; into 610 cardboard boxes. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warhol.org/timecapsule/time-capsules/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time Capsules&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were never sold as art, but they were meticulously cataloged by museum archivists and displayed in a major exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242174661/dead-bees-nail-clippings-and-priceless-art-in-warhols-time-capsules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warhol was a packrat&lt;/a&gt;. But that desire to collect helped inform his artistic point of view.” Yet Warhol was aware of his compulsion, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27949117?seq=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disturbed him&lt;/a&gt;: “I'm so sick of the way I live, of all this junk, and always dragging home more.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Where does the hobby of collection cross over into hoarding, and who makes this determination? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Artists get an automatic pass into the realm of collectionism, no matter their level of compulsion. The Vancouver Art Gallery held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140812083317if_/http://couplandexhibition.org/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major exhibition&lt;/a&gt; of the works of Canadian writer and artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://coupland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. One of the sections consisted of a room filled with 5,000 objects collected over 20 years and carefully arranged in a masterwork called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/06/welcome-to-douglas-couplands-brain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Brain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Collectors may be passionate, but their obsessions/compulsions do not hinder their everyday function (or personal safety).

She had various collections of objects (e.g., glass shoes, decorator plates, snuff bottles, and ceremonial masks), but what really stood out were her &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;accumulations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — organized but excessive stockpiles of useful items such as flashlights, slippers, sweatshirts, kitchen towels, and watches (although most of the latter were no longer useful).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s864/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;767&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Ten pairs of unworn gardening gloves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the year+ of COVID sheltering-in-place, some people wrote books, published papers, started nonprofits, engaged in fundraising, held Zoom benefit events, demonstrated for BLM, home-schooled their kids, taught classes, cared for sick household members, mourned the loss of their elder relatives, or endured COVID-19 themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I dealt with the loss of a parent, along with the solo task of emptying 51 years of accumulated belongings from her home. To cope with this sad and lonely and emotionally grueling task, I took photos of my mother's accumulations and collections. It became a mini-obsession unto itself. I tried to make sense of my mother's motivations, but the trauma of her suffering and the specter of an unresolved childhood were too overwhelming. Besides, there's no computational model to explain the differences between Collectors, Accumulators and Hoarders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/compulsive-collecting-of-toy-bullets.html&quot;&gt;Compulsive Collecting of Toy Bullets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/compulsive-collecting-of-televisions.html&quot;&gt;Compulsive Collecting of Televisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/neural-correlates-of-compulsive.html&quot;&gt;The Neural Correlates of Compulsive Hoarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/06/welcome-to-douglas-couplands-brain.html&quot;&gt;Welcome to Douglas Coupland's Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halperin DA, Glick J.

It's a misguided effort when the goal is framed so simplistically (or monolithically).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, whose brain are we trying to explain? Yours? Mine? The brain of a monkey, mouse, marsupial, monotreme, mosquito, or mollusk? Or &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; with its 306 neurons? “Yeah yeah, we get the point,” you say, “stop being so sarcastic and cynical. We're searching for core principles, first principles.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;What does “core principle” mean?&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Pruszynski (@andpru) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andpru/status/1314266663508992017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In response to that tweet, definitions of “core principle” included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Basically: &lt;/span&gt;a formal account of why brains encode information and control behaviour in the way that they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamental theories on the underlying mechanisms of behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Maybe “first principles” would be better?]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set of rules by which neurons work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the problem of explanation. What are we trying to explain? Behavior, of course [&lt;i&gt;a very specific behavior&lt;/i&gt; most of the time]: X behavior in your model organism. But we also want to explain thought, memory, perception, emotion, neurological disorders, mental illnesses, etc. Seems daunting now, eh? Can the same core principles account for all these phenomena across species? I'll step out on a limb here and say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then snort for asking such an unfair question. Best that your research program is broken down into tiny reductionistic chunks. More manageable that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what counts as an “explanation”? We haven't answered that yet. It depends on your goal and your preferred level of analysis (à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Marr's 3 levels of analysis, from 'Vision'&quot;&gt;three levels&lt;/a&gt; of David Marr): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s320/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias&quot;&gt;Krakauer et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, what counts as “explanation”?

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: news: Characterization of an open access medical news platform readership during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
	<link>https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/26666/accepted</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract:  Background:

There now exists many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up-to-date with medical literature. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Objective:

The current study aimed to employ readership and survey data to characterize open access medical news readership trends in relation to COVID-19 in addition to overall readership trends regarding pandemic related information delivery.

Methods:

Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &amp;lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale.

Results:

COVID-19 articles had significantly more median views than non-COVID-19 articles (296 vs. 110, U = 748.5, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average read times or bounce rate. Non-COVID-19 had more median actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs. 2.5, U = 2070.5, P &amp;lt; 0.05). On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), survey data revealed that 66% (78/119) of readers Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID-19 using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine versus direct journal access. A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (71.7%) than direct journal article access (50.8%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated reading one or less full length medical study following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (16.9% vs. 31.8%, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Conclusions:

There is a significantly increased readership in one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic, reinforcing that open-access physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers to stay up to date with medical literature.</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: FDA and CDC OK resuming J&amp;J COVID-19 shots paused over rare clot concerns</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-janssen-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-resume-pause-rare-blood-clot</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After reviewing safety data on rare blood clots linked to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, federal regulators said vaccinations can resume immediately in people 18 and older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the ruling April 23 following a meeting of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices about the vaccine, made by Janssen, J&amp;amp;J’s vaccine division. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The single-dose vaccine was given&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization&quot;&gt; emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt; February 27 by the FDA (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/27/21&lt;/em&gt;). Federal health officials&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-pause-blood-clot&quot;&gt; paused immunizations with the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; April 13 while they investigated the rare blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The American public should feel reassured about the safety systems and protocols we have in place around the COVID-19 vaccines,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said during a news briefing April 23. The system to detect safety concerns identified a small number of cases of rare blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts. The pause gave regulators time to spread the word to doctors and the public about the risk, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some members of the CDC advisory committee said that they were concerned that the decision doesn’t adequately warn women of an increased risk of rare blood clots. J&amp;amp;J and the FDA have added information to fact sheets about the vaccine that warns of the rare side effect and provides treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials examined data collected in the vaccine safety reporting system known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vaers.hhs.gov/&quot;&gt;VAERS,&lt;/a&gt; where anyone can report side effects from vaccines. They found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/03-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf&quot;&gt;15 cases of blood clots&lt;/a&gt;, all in women, among 7.95 million J&amp;amp;J doses administered. Three women died. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 15 cases, 13 were in women 18 to 49 years old out of the more than 1.8 million women in that age range who got the J&amp;amp;J jabs. That is an incidence rate of 7 in 1 million in women younger than 50. For women 50 and older, the incidence rate of clots was 0.9 in 1 million, based on two cases out of more than 2.1 million doses given in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Women’s predicted risk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For every million doses of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine administered to women, health experts predict 15 may develop dangerous blood clots. But they found that the benefits of the shots — the number of deaths, hospitalizations and intensive care admissions prevented — outweigh that risk, particularly for women 50 and older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-right has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;Source: CDC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One man developed the clots during a clinical trial of the vaccine’s efficacy, but his case was not included in the new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10 additional cases are under review now, but more may be found once investigators change their case definitions to include a broader range of symptoms, said Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine task force during the ACIP meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation comes after the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mY0_yz2io&quot;&gt; European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; ruled April 20 that immunizations with J&amp;amp;J’s vaccine could continue in European Union countries, but with warnings about the rare side effect. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swollen legs, persistent abdominal pain, severe headaches or blurred vision starting about a week after vaccination, or bruising or blood flecks under the skin in locations other than the injection site. Doctors should avoid treating patients with the clots with the blood thinner heparin, as that common treatment could prompt an immune reaction that leads to even more clots. The same reaction is seen in a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clotting problem has also been a rare side effect of a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. The EMA said April 23 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeEecXcOtAw&amp;amp;t=8s&quot;&gt;a news briefing&lt;/a&gt; that particularly when infection rates are high in a community, the blood clot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/chmp-annex/annex-vaxzevria-art53-visual-risk-contextualisation_en.pdf&quot;&gt;risk is clearly outweighed by the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of reduced hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions for all age groups, and reduced deaths for all but the youngest adults. The agency recommended that people continue to get their second doses of that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both vaccines, many people who have developed clots after taking the vaccines have also been found to have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-blood-clot-immune-astrazeneca-johnson-johnson&quot;&gt; antibodies against a protein called platelet factor 4&lt;/a&gt;, or PF4, found on blood- clotting cells called platelets (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/16/21&lt;/em&gt;). It’s unclear if these vaccines stimulate formation of these antibodies or trigger clotting in people who already have the antibodies. Scientists are investigating possible genetic predispositions to getting the clots, but researchers still don’t know what puts people at risk, Peter Marks, the FDA’s director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during the news briefing. “We don’t see any clear association with oral contraceptives or any one of the typical risks that some people have for blood clotting.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/06-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf&quot;&gt;CDC’s assessment of risks and benefits&lt;/a&gt; of the J&amp;amp;J vaccine for the general population, allowing vaccinations for everyone 18 and older would prevent 1,435 deaths and 2,236 ICU admissions out of 9.8 million people vaccinated. Under those conditions, 26 cases of the blood clots would be expected to result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On an individual level, for every million doses of the vaccine given to women 18 to 49 years old, the CDC predicts 13 cases of blood clots would result. At the same time, immunization would prevent 12 deaths, 127 ICU admissions and 657 hospitalizations for women in that age group. By contrast, for every million men 18 to 49 years old who get the vaccine, two cases of blood clots are expected. The benefits for those men include preventing 11 deaths, 114 ICU admissions, and 601 hospitalizations. And for people over 50 the benefits are even greater. No cases of blood clots are expected in older men, and two cases in every million doses are expected for women 50 and older. Benefits would include preventing hundreds of deaths and thousands of ICU admissions and hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Men’s predicted risk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, only one man is known to have developed the rare blood clots after receiving Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 shot in a clinical trial. The CDC’s risk-benefit analysis predicts that for every million doses, only two men under age 50 will get the clots, while hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalizations will be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;Expected benefits vs. risks per 1 million doses of J&amp;amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some health experts were critical of the pause on the vaccine, fearing that it could hamper immunization efforts and increase hesitancy to get COVID-19 vaccines. “I want this vaccine back as soon as possible,” Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said April 22 during a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The vaccine is useful for reaching homebound, unhoused and incarcerated people and has been used in emergency rooms, mobile vaccine clinics and other settings where people are unlikely to come back for a second dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been a sharp decline in vaccination rates in the United States in recent weeks. Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends&quot;&gt;about 2 million doses are given each day&lt;/a&gt;, down from an average of 3.2 million doses on April 11, according to CDC data.  It’s not clear if the decline in vaccination is due to the pause or reflects that most people who want the vaccine have already gotten it. A recent Harris poll found that the pause &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/johnson-johnson-vaccine-hesitancy-44b21fa2-95ce-4d8e-bce2-13ac78ff018e.html&quot;&gt;damaged overall confidence in vaccine safety in about 30 percent of people &lt;/a&gt;who planned to get immunized as soon as possible. Among those who said they would not get vaccinated, 80 percent indicated that the pause eroded their confidence in vaccines. A CDC poll indicated a sharp drop in the willingness to get the J&amp;amp;J vaccine after the pause. Only 19 percent of those polled April 19 said they would choose it. Before the pause people would choose that vaccine about as often as either the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J voluntarily paused its clinical trial to test the vaccine in adolescents 12 to 17 years old. Those tests may resume if the company chooses, Marks said. “We won’t have any objections to them restarting their trials.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: NASA’s Perseverance rover split CO2 to make breathable air on Mars</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-oxygen-air</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover just created a breath of fresh air on Mars. An experimental device on the rover split carbon dioxide molecules into their component parts, creating about 10 minutes’ worth of breathable oxygen. It was also enough oxygen to make tiny amounts of rocket fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The instrument, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life&quot;&gt;MOXIE&lt;/a&gt; (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment), is about the size of a toaster (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/28/20&lt;/em&gt;). Its job is to break oxygen atoms off carbon dioxide, the primary component of Mars’ atmosphere. It’s like “an electrical tree,” says principal investigator Michael Hecht of MIT. “We breathe in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and breathe out oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MOXIE flew to Mars with Perseverance, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-audio&quot;&gt;arrived on the Red Planet on February 18&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/21&lt;/em&gt;). On April 20, the instrument warmed up to about 800° Celsius and ran for long enough to produce five grams of oxygen. That’s not enough to breathe for very long. But the main reason to make oxygen on Mars isn’t for breathing, Hecht says. It’s for making fuel for the return journey to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we burn anything, gas in the car or a log in the fireplace, most of what we’re burning is oxygen,” Hecht says. On Earth, we take all that oxygen for granted. “It’s free here. We don’t think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Future astronauts will have to either bring oxygen with them or make it on Mars. A rocket powerful enough to lift a few astronauts off the Red Planet’s surface would need about 25 metric tons of oxygen — too much to pack for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MOXIE is a prototype for the device astronauts could use to make rocket fuel in the future. When running at full power, the instrument can create about 10 grams of oxygen per hour. The instrument, powered by Perseverance, will run for about one Martian day at a time. A scaled-up version could run continuously for 26 months before astronauts arrive, Hecht says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MOXIE can’t run continuously because Perseverance needs to divert its power back to its other instruments to continue its science mission of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life&quot;&gt;searching for signs of past life on Mars&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/10/18&lt;/em&gt;). MOXIE will get a chance to run at least nine more times over the next Martian year (about two Earth years).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The success of the technology could set the stage for a permanent research station on Mars, like the McMurdo station in Antarctica, something Hecht would like to someday see. “That’s not something I expect to see in my lifetime, but something I expect to see progress towards in my lifetime,” he says. “MOXIE brings it closer by a decade.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study has found that about two-thirds of conversations don’t end when we want them to. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers who monitored over 900 conversations found that most people wanted them to finish sooner, though a minority wanted them to continue for longer. This was true whether participants were talking to someone they had just met or a loved one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22368306/social-awkwardness-conversations-adam-mastroianni&quot;&gt;Adam Mastroianni tells Sean Illing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41869&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is lockdown affecting the way people grieve?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033312-600-the-science-of-how-lockdown-messes-with-the-way-we-grieve/&quot;&gt;Dean Burnett looks at the science, and his own personal experience&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet more on dolphin psychology this week: dolphins appear to remember the “names” of those who have co-operated with them previously, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/dolphins-learn-names-their-friends-form-teams-first-animal-kingdom&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Morell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to human names, dolphins have signature whistles which are given to them by their mothers. The researchers played recordings of signature whistles to bottlenose dolphins, finding that the marine mammals almost always turned towards the whistle of a dolphin with whom they had an established alliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve written a lot recently about trials into the use of psychedelic drugs to treat depression&lt;/strong&gt;. But what’s the mechanism behind the purported antidepressant effect of these drugs? &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2021/04/how-lsd-might-cure-depression/&quot;&gt;Tom Chivers takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Unherd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers are testing whether a video game used as a treatment for kids with ADHD could help people struggling with memory and attention problems after recovering from COVID-19.&lt;/strong&gt; The game improves people’s ability to do more than one thing at once, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391587/long-covid-brain-cognitive-treatment-video-game-akili&quot;&gt;Faith Gunning tells Nicole Wetsman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which might prove helpful to COVID-19 survivors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although we often hear about the potential risks of certain online communities, they also provide an important source of support. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/yes-online-communities-pose-risks-for-young-people-but-they-are-also-important-sources-of-support-158276&quot;&gt;researcher Benjamin Kaveladze discusses&lt;/a&gt; his work highlighting the sense of support, belonging, and validation which mental health forums can provide to young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;: there have been lots of videos of dogs supposedly “talking” to their owners by pressing certain buttons on a board — but are these animals truly communicating?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/talking-dogs-really-159075&quot;&gt;Mélissa Berthet and Léo Migotti outline the reasons to be sceptical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Experts predict U.S. COVID-19 cases will dip in summer but surge in winter</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-prediction-summer-winter-surge</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The coming months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States may feel a bit like a roller-coaster ride.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current surge in the number of cases will dip over the summer, then rise again in the winter, a health expert predicted April 22 during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-covid-trends--life-after-vaccination/&quot;&gt;news briefing&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Meanwhile, cases are expected to continue to rise globally, largely fueled by cases in South Asia, particularly India, said Ali Mokdad, a public health researcher at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As more Americans get vaccinated, daily deaths are predicted to decline, Mokdad said, from about 700 deaths per day as of April 21 to about 200 deaths per day by August 1. By then, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&amp;amp;tab=trend&quot;&gt;U.S. cumulative death toll from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; is expected to reach 618,000, up from about 570,000 currently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As with other respiratory viruses, when cold weather drives more people back inside, cases and deaths could surge again, Mokdad said. How bad it gets depends on whether people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/21&lt;/em&gt;). “Come winter… we expect a rise in cases and we’ll be swimming upstream,” he said. “We have a problem coming. Please, wear your mask.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If 95 percent of people wear masks, the rise in cases and deaths could be mild, he said. Vaccines, coronavirus variants, the number of people who have already had COVID-19 and how much people interact with others could change the equation as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking longer-term, the coronavirus is here to stay, Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases doctor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said in the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a mistake to think that we’re going to get to COVID-zero. This is not an eradicable disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if enough people get vaccinated, the virus may eventually become more like a seasonal cold. “These vaccines … will change your life,” Adalja said. “These vaccines were made to defang or tame the virus, and they’re doing an excellent job at that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some “breakthrough” infections have happened among fully vaccinated people, but those infections tend to produce mild symptoms with few instances of serious illness or hospitalization, Adalja said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease&quot;&gt;Vaccinated people are also less likely to spread the virus to others&lt;/a&gt; if they do catch it (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/30/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, until herd immunity has been reached, people will still need to wear masks, Adalja said.  But, he added, “the more people we get vaccinated, the less likely we will have to think about masks again for COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The extent to which we can blame our genes for bad behavior took another step backward recently, in the US at least, with a court ruling that data from the “warrior gene” couldn’t be used as an excuse for diminished responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belief in the existence of a warrior gene has been around for more than 25 years, one of many examples where genetic effects on behavior have been misunderstood. In 1994, Stephen Mobley, convicted of murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm, was sentenced to death. His trial occurred soon after the publication of a paper attributing aggression to a deficiency of MAOA. Supporting this claim were data reporting that eight men from the same family had repeated episodes of aggressive behavior. One had been convicted at the age of 23 of the rape of his sister. Another tried to run over his boss with a car at the sheltered workshop where he was employed after having been told that his work was not up to par. A third would enter his sisters’ bedrooms at night, armed with a knife, and force them to undress. At least two more were known arsonists. Han Brunner, the geneticist in the Netherlands who described this unfortunate family, found evidence that males with criminal behavior had a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which is involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, the last being the target of antidepressants such as Prozac. Since men have only one copy of the gene (one X chromosome), the men with the mutation in MAOA had no functional enzyme. On the face of it, MAOA mutations were making Dr Brunner’s patients aggressive. Mobley filed a motion seeking funds to hire expert witnesses to assess whether he, like the men in the paper, had a deficiency of the MAOA gene, which was later to become famous as the “warrior gene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Mobley’s bad luck that the court threw out his petition, and he was subsequently executed by lethal injection, but news of his defence soon spread. In Ohio in 2000, lawyers for Dion Wayne Sanders tried the MAOA argument, and though the court decided it could not be shown that when Sanders shot both of his grandparents he lacked the specific intent to kill them, the jury returned verdicts of imprisonment rather than the death penalty. And, in a case heard in Tennessee in 2009, with respect to the genetic data, the court found “as a matter of law, that the expert services sought are necessary to ensure that the constitutional rights of the Defendant are properly protected.” So began a saga that has persisted till February 2021, when the New Mexico Supreme Court threw out the “warrior gene” defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and … arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, don’t imagine for a second that this is a death blow for genetic determinism. The court’s decision means that a mutation in a single gene (MAOA) can’t be blamed for violent acts, and since no one has found a mutation in any of the 23,000 other genes in the human genome that causes violence, it’s now pretty certain that there no warrior genes. But there is a possibility that we can blame someone’s genetic constitution in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s become clear over the last decade is that almost all behavior is heritable (to some extent) and that it arises from the joint contribution of thousands of individual genetic variants. These variants are not mutations that kill a gene or give it a new function. In fact, individually, they don’t do much at all, just increasing or decreasing the likelihood of a behavior by a very small amount (if you think of it as percentage where the warrior gene has a 100% effect, then these variants have an effect less than 0.01%). While individually small, there are so many thousands of them that in total the effect is detectable. Scientists have been getting better and better at predicting behavioral outcomes from aggregate assays of genetic data. This is because genetic data is being harvested on an increasingly large scale; it’s routine to publish results from millions of individuals—one of the best and most productive sources of such data comes from the UK where 500,000 people were recruited into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;UK BioBank&lt;/a&gt;. As datasets grow bigger, the predictive accuracy of genetic data has improved and is being touted in the clinics as a way to diagnose heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other common diseases. It won’t be long before lawyers realize they have a new toy: “don’t blame my client, he couldn’t help himself, it was all in his genes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-warrior-gene-blaming-genetics-for-bad-behavior/&quot;&gt;The “warrior gene”: blaming genetics for bad behavior&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649872592/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649872592/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649872592/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/can-skepticism-and-curiosity-get-along-benjamin-franklin-shows-they-can-coexist/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Can skepticism and curiosity get along?

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked past a baker’s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?  Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it’s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12348&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/bagel-1434064-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.  These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02618-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Pediatrics: Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12349&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-6165772_1920-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.  Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of “political skill” can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12350&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/politics-2361943_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research.   The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five “thematic dimensions” which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00536-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Psychology: Does walking through a doorway always make you forget?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;doorway effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.  Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12351&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/idea-3338440_1920-300x196.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person’s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Mysterious ‘yellowballs’ littering the Milky Way are clusters of newborn stars</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowballs-stars-milky-way-space-astronomy</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have cracked the case of mysterious cosmic objects dubbed “yellowballs.” The celestial specks &lt;a&gt;mark &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe87a&quot;&gt;the birthplaces of many kinds of stars&lt;/a&gt; with a wide range of masses, rather than single supermassive stars, researchers report April 13 in the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stars in the clusters are relatively young, only about 100,000 years old. “I think of these as stars in utero,” says Grace Wolf-Chase, an astronomer at the Planetary Science Institute who is based in Naperville, Ill. For comparison, the massive stars forming in the Orion nebula are about 3 million years old, and the middle-aged sun is 4.6 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Volunteers with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project&quot;&gt;Milky Way Project&lt;/a&gt; first identified the objects while scouring pictures of the galaxy taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The now-defunct observatory saw the cosmos in infrared light, which let astronomers take a sort of stellar ultrasound “to probe what’s going on in these cold environments before the stars are actually born,” says Wolf-Chase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Citizen scientists had been looking through these images for baby stars thought to be at least 10 times the mass of the sun that were blowing giant bubbles of ionized gas. A year or two into the project, some users began labeling certain objects with the tag #yellowballs¸ because that’s what they looked like in the false-color images. Between 2010 and 2015, the volunteers found 928 yellowballs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolf-Chase’s team initially thought the balls represented early stage gas bubbles. But because yellowballs were a serendipitous discovery, the researchers knew they probably hadn’t caught enough of them to definitively ID the objects. In 2016, the team asked Milky Way Project volunteers to find more. By the following year, the group had spotted more than 6,000 yellowballs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;yellowball cluster of baby stars&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098823&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/041621_lg_yellowballs_inline1_rev680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098823&quot;&gt;Astronomers first thought ‘yellowballs’ (circled left) were precursors to gas bubbles blown around massive, young stars (right). But a new study suggests yellowballs are actually clusters of less massive stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098823&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolf-Chase and colleagues compared about 500 of those balls to existing catalogs of star clusters and other structures to try to figure out what they were. “Now we have a good answer: They’re infant star clusters,” Wolf-Chase says. The clusters blow ionized bubbles of their own, similar to the stellar bubbles blown by single young, big stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolf-Chase hopes researchers will be able to use the work to pick out yellowballs with telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, which is due to launch in October, and figure out more about the balls’ physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Resolving Arguments Can Prevent Bad Feelings From Lingering — And We Get Better At It As We Age</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/22/resolving-arguments-can-prevent-bad-feelings-from-lingering-and-we-get-better-at-it-as-we-age/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Don’t go to bed on an argument” is an adage we’ve all heard and, at some point, probably ignored. Hackneyed as it is, the phrase does have some truth: resolving arguments, rather than letting them simmer away, can make us feel calmer and happier the next day (and also makes it easier to actually get to sleep).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbab006/6076809?login=true#229317336&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Oregon State University’s Dakota D. Witzel and Robert S. Stawski has looked at the benefits of resolving arguments — and the team finds that not only can resolution almost erase the emotional stress associated with a big argument altogether, but that individual differences can affect how well we do it. The older we get, they find, the less we argue and the better we are at dealing with argument-related stress when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41862&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was taken from a daily diary study, in which more than 2,000 participants completed via end-of-day phone interviews over eight days. First, positive and negative affect was measured, with participants indicating how much of the day they had spent feeling particular emotions such as anxiety and cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyday stressors were also recorded, with participants reporting whether or not they had experienced a specific type of negative event within the last twenty four hours. This included not only arguments, but &lt;em&gt;avoided&lt;/em&gt; arguments (“did anything happen that you could have argued about but you decided to let pass in order to avoid a disagreement?”). The team also recorded whether or not these stressors were resolved, as well as how severe the stressor was on a scale from one to three. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arguments were pretty common: 1,355 arguments were recorded over the eight days (9.10% of all days), of which 95% had a severity greater than one. There were also 2,177 avoided arguments, 86% of which also had a severity greater than one. A total of 65% of all arguments were resolved compared to 63% of avoided arguments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, arguments and avoided arguments had a big impact on mood and affect: negative affect was higher and positive affect lower on days with arguments than those without. This negative affect was even higher when disagreements had not been dealt with, with unresolved arguments associated with increased negative affect over the following days. Resolved arguments, on the other hand, did not increase low mood, and also had a “residue effect” — in other words, resolving an argument mitigated the emotional impact for days to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Age played a huge role here. Older participants had a significantly lower number of both arguments and avoided arguments to begin with, and age was also associated with increased likelihood of arguments being resolved — adults aged above 68 were over 40% more likely than people under the age of 45 to report their conflicts as resolved. Older people also saw less of an increase in negative mood after arguments, even if they did go unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what can explain this pattern of results? The first and most obvious answer would be that older people are simply more experienced when it comes to resolving arguments. Handling conflict in relationships is not always easy and may require some practice before getting it right: the older you are, the more practice you’re likely to have. The team also posits that older people are simply more motivated to avoid arguments and that they have more emotional resilience than younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another notable finding from the study is that bad feelings can linger when arguments go unresolved, with a potential impact on health and wellbeing more generally. Developing ways in which people can start to improve their conflict resolution skills could therefore provide wider benefits than just improving relationships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbab006/6076809?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;Resolution Status and Age as Moderators for Interpersonal Everyday Stress and Stressor-Related Affect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On most mornings, Jeremy D. Brown eats an avocado. But first, he gives it a little squeeze. A ripe avocado will yield to that pressure, but not too much. Brown also gauges the fruit’s weight in his hand and feels the waxy skin, with its bumps and ridges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t imagine not having the sense of touch to be able to do something as simple as judging the ripeness of that avocado,” says Brown, a mechanical engineer who studies haptic feedback — how information is gained or transmitted through touch — at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of us have thought about touch more than usual during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hugs and high fives rarely happen outside of the immediate household these days. A surge in online shopping has meant fewer chances to touch things before buying. And many people have skipped travel, such as visits to the beach where they might sift sand through their fingers. A lot goes into each of those actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anytime we touch anything, our perceptual experience is the product of the activity of thousands of nerve fibers and millions of neurons in the brain,” says neuroscientist Sliman Bensmaia of the University of Chicago. The body’s natural sense of touch is remarkably complex. Nerve receptors detect cues about pressure, shape, motion, texture, temperature and more. Those cues cause patterns of neural activity, which the central nervous system interprets so we can tell if something is smooth or rough, wet or dry, moving or still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is at the heart of research on touch. Yet mechanical engineers like Brown and others, along with experts in math and materials science, are studying touch with an eye toward translating the science into helpful applications. Researchers hope their work will lead to new and improved technologies that mimic tactile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As scientists and engineers learn more about how our nervous system responds to touch stimuli, they’re also studying how our skin interacts with different materials. And they’ll need ways for people to send and receive simulated touch sensations. All these efforts present challenges, but progress is happening. In the near term, people who have lost limbs might recover some sense of touch through their artificial limbs. Longer term, haptics research might add touch to online shopping, enable new forms of remote medicine and expand the world of virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anytime you’re interacting with an object, your skin deforms,” or squishes a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sliman Bensmaia&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Good vibrations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality programs already give users a sense of what it’s like to wander through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/virtual_reality_camera_captures_life_on_ISS&quot;&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; or trek around a &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.edf.org/insights/how-virtual-reality-can-help-the-oil-and-gas-industry-confront-its-invisible-challenge-methane/&quot;&gt;natural gas well&lt;/a&gt;. For touch to be part of such experiences, researchers will need to reproduce the signals that trigger haptic sensations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are covered in nerve endings that respond to touch, and our hands are really loaded up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/blog/eureka-lab/do-it-yourself-map-touch&quot;&gt;especially our fingertips&lt;/a&gt;. Some receptors tell where parts of us are in relation to the rest of the body. Others sense pain and temperature. One goal for haptics researchers is to mimic sensations resulting from force and movement, such as pressure, sliding or rubbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anytime you’re interacting with an object, your skin deforms,” or squishes a bit, Bensmaia explains. Press on the raised dots of a braille letter, and the dots will poke your skin. A soapy glass slipping through your fingers produces a shearing force — and possibly a crash. Rub fabric between your fingers, and the action produces vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four main categories of touch receptors respond to those and other mechanical stimuli. There’s some overlap among the types. And a single contact with an object can affect multiple types of receptors, Bensmaia notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One type, called Pacinian corpuscles, sits deep in the skin. They are especially good at detecting vibrations created when we interact with different textures. When stimulated, the receptors produce sequences of signals that travel to the brain over a period of time. Our brains interpret the signals as a particular texture. Bensmaia compares it to the way we hear a series of notes and recognize a tune.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deep feelings &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four main types of touch receptors respond to mechanical stimulation of the skin: Meissner corpuscles, Merkel cells, Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles. Some respond better to certain kinds of stimuli than others. Recent studies have focused on the deep-skin Pacinian corpuscles, which respond to vibrations created when fingers rub against textured materials. &lt;/p&gt;

Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;diagram of the four main types of touch receptors in skin&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098903&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_touch_inline-1_skin-diagram_mobile.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098903&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Corduroy will produce one set of vibrations. Organza will produce another set,” Bensmaia says. Each texture produces “a different set of vibrations in your skin that we can measure.” Such measurements are a first step toward trying to reproduce the feel of different textures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, any stimulus meant to mimic a texture sensation must be strong enough to trigger responses in the nervous system’s touch receptors. That’s where work by researchers at the University of Birmingham in England comes in. The vibrations from contact with various textures create different kinds of wave energy. Rolling-type waves called Rayleigh waves &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/41/eabb6912&quot;&gt;go deep enough to reach the Pacinian receptors&lt;/a&gt;, the team reported last October in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. Much larger versions of the same types of waves cause much of the damage from earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all touches are forceful enough to trigger a response from the Pacinian receptors. To gain more insight into which interactions will stimulate those receptors, the team looked at studies that have collected data on touches to the limbs, head or neck of dogs, dolphins, rhinos, elephants and other mammals. A pattern emerged. The group calls it a “universal scaling law” of touch for mammals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the most part, a touch at the surface will trigger a response in a Pacinian receptor deep in the skin if the ratio is 5-to-2 between the length of the Rayleigh waves resulting from the touch and the depth of the receptor. At that ratio or higher, a person and most other mammals will feel the sensation, says mathematician James Andrews, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Universality of touch &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pattern in the ratio of length of Rayleigh waves moving through skin while touching an object and the depth of Pacinian touch receptors suggests that the same amount of deformation in the skin of several different mammals, except rodents, will produce similar sensations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Ratio of Rayleigh wavelength to touch receptor depth in various mammals&lt;/h6&gt;

Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Source: J. Andrews &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, the amount of skin displacement needed to cause wavelengths long enough to trigger a sensation by the Pacinian receptors will be the same across most mammal species, the group found. Different species will need more or less force to cause that displacement, however, which may depend on skin composition or other factors. Rodents did not fit the 5–2 ratio, perhaps because their paws and limbs are so small compared with the wavelengths created when they touch things, Andrews notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the work sheds light on “what types of information you’d need to realistically capture the haptic experience — the touch experience — and send that digitally anywhere,” Andrews says. People could then feel sensations with a device or perhaps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/feeling-objects-arent-there&quot;&gt;ultrasonic waves&lt;/a&gt;. Someday the research might help provide a wide range of virtual reality experiences, including virtual hugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Online tactile shopping&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mechanical engineer Cynthia Hipwell of Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station moved into a new house before the pandemic. She looked at some couches online but couldn’t bring herself to buy one from a website. “I didn’t want to choose couch fabric without feeling it,” Hipwell says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, in the long run, if you’re shopping on Amazon, you could feel fabric,” she says. Web pages’ computer codes would make certain areas on a screen mimic different textures, perhaps with shifts in electrical charge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://peshkin.mech.northwestern.edu/publications/2015_Shultz_Electroadhesion.pdf&quot;&gt;vibration signals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13864.pdf&quot;&gt;ultrasound&lt;/a&gt; or other methods. Touching the screen would clue you in to whether a sweater is soft or scratchy, or if a couch’s fabric feels bumpy or smooth. Before that can happen, researchers need to understand conditions that affect our perception of how a computer screen feels.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Surface features at the nanometer scale (billionths of a meter) can affect how we perceive the texture of a piece of glass, Hipwell says. Likewise, we may not consciously feel any wetness as humidity in the air mixes with our skin’s oil and sweat. But tiny changes in that moisture can alter the friction our fingers encounter as they move on a screen, she says. And that friction can influence how we perceive the screen’s texture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shifts in electric charge also can change the attraction between a finger and a touch screen. That attraction is called electroadhesion, and it affects our tactile experience as we touch a screen. Hipwell’s group recently developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028166&quot;&gt;a computer model that accounts for the effects of electroadhesion,&lt;/a&gt; moisture and the deformation of skin pressing against glass. The team reported on the work in March 2020 in&lt;em&gt; IEEE Transactions on Haptics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hipwell hopes the model can help product designers develop haptic touch screens that go beyond online shopping. A car’s computerized dashboard might have sections that change texture for each menu, she suggests. A driver could change temperature or radio settings by touch while keeping eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, in the long run, if you’re shopping on Amazon, you could feel fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cynthia Hipwell&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Wireless touch patches&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine visits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm&quot;&gt;rose dramatically&lt;/a&gt; during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But video doesn’t let doctors feel for swollen glands or press an abdomen to check for lumps. Remote medicine with a sense of touch might help during pandemics like this one — and long after for people in remote areas with few doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People in those places might eventually have remote sensing equipment in their own homes or at a pharmacy or workplace. If that becomes feasible, a robot, glove or other equipment with sensors could touch parts of a patient’s body. The information would be relayed to a device somewhere else. A doctor at that other location could then experience the sensations of touching the patient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are already working on materials that can translate digital information about touch into sensations people — in this case, doctors — can feel. The same materials could communicate information for virtual reality applications. One possibility is a skin patch developed by physical chemist John Rogers of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One layer of the flexible patch sticks to a person’s skin. Other layers include a stretchable circuit board and tiny actuators that create vibrations as current flows around them. Wireless signals tell the actuators to turn on or off. Energy to run the patch also comes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/power-induction&quot;&gt;wirelessly&lt;/a&gt;. The team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1687-0&quot;&gt;described the patch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Garrett Anderson shakes hands with researcher Aadeel Akhtar&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098907&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_touch_inline-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098907&quot;&gt;Retired U.S. Army Sgt. Garrett Anderson shakes hands with researcher Aadeel Akhtar, CEO of Psyonic, a prosthesis developer. A wireless skin patch on Anderson’s upper arm gives him sensory feedback when grasping an object.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098907&quot;&gt;Northwestern Univ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;prototype patch&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098906&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_touch_inline-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;Inside the patch are circular actuators that vibrate in response to signals. The prototype device might give the sensation of touch pressure in artificial limbs, in virtual reality and telemedicine.
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, Rogers’ group has reduced the patch’s thickness and weight. The patch now also provides more detailed information to a wearer. “We have scaled the systems into a modular form to allow custom sizes [and] shapes in a kind of plug-and-play scheme,” Rogers notes. So far, up to six separate patches can work at the same time on different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group also wants to make its technology work with electronics that many consumers have, such as smartphones. Toward that end, Rogers and colleagues have developed a pressure-sensitive touch screen interface for sending information to the device. The interface lets someone provide haptic sensations by moving their fingers on a smartphone or touch screen–based computer screen. A person wearing the patch then feels stroking, tapping or other touch sensations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Pressure points&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Rogers’ team has developed a way to use the patch system to pick up signals from pressure on a prosthetic arm’s fingertips. Those signals can then be relayed to a patch worn by the person with the artificial limb. Other researchers also are testing ways to add tactile feedback to prostheses. European researchers reported in 2019 that adding feedback for pressure and motion helped people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-prosthetic-leg-senses-touch-reduces-phantom-pain&quot;&gt;with an artificial leg walk with more confidence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/12/19, p. 8&lt;/em&gt;). The device &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0567-3&quot;&gt;reduced phantom limb pain as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown, the mechanical engineer at Johns Hopkins, hopes to help people control the force of their artificial limbs. Nondisabled people adjust their hands’ force instinctively, he notes. He often takes his young daughter’s hand when they’re in a parking lot. If she starts to pull away, he gently squeezes. But he might easily hurt her if he couldn’t sense the stiffness of her flesh and bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two types of prosthetic limbs can let people who lost an arm do certain movements again. Hands on “body-controlled” limbs open or close when the user moves other muscle groups. The movement works a cable on a harness that connects to the hand. Force on those other muscles tells the person if the hand is open or closed. Myoelectric prosthetic limbs, in contrast, are directly controlled by the muscles on the residual limb. Those muscle-controlled electronic limbs generally don’t give any feedback about touch. Compared with the body-controlled options, however, they allow a greater range of motion and can offer other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one study, Brown’s group tested two ways to add feedback about the force that a muscle-controlled electronic limb exerts on an object. One method used an exoskeleton that applied force around a person’s elbow. The other technique used a device strapped near the wrist. The stiffer an object is, the stronger the vibrations on someone’s wrist. Volunteers without limb loss tried using each setup to judge the stiffness of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;

Thomas &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;J. NeuroEng. Rehab&lt;/em&gt;. 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;haptic feedback system that applied force near the elbow&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098900&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_touch_inline-6-553x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;553&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098900&quot;&gt;The other system tested in the study provided vibrations near the wrist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098900&quot;&gt;N. Thomas &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;J. NeuroEng. Rehab&lt;/em&gt;. 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both methods worked better than no feedback. And compared with each other, the two types of feedback “worked equally well,” Brown says. “We think that is because, in the end, what the human user is doing is creating a map.” Basically, people match up how much force corresponds to the intensity of each type of feedback. The work &lt;a href=&quot;https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-019-0545-5&quot;&gt;suggests ways to improve muscle-controlled electronic limbs&lt;/a&gt;, Brown and colleagues reported in 2019 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Helpful feedback &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Volunteers without limb loss wore an artificial lower arm with and without different types of haptic feedback: one at the elbow and one at the wrist. Participants compared the softness or hardness of different blocks. Both types of feedback improved participants’ accuracy in judging stiffness over the tests with no feedback. &lt;/p&gt;

Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Source: N. Thomas &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;J. NeuroEng. Rehab.&lt;/em&gt; 2019&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, people’s brains may not be able to match up all types of feedback for touch sensations. Bensmaia’s group at the University of Chicago has worked with colleagues in Sweden who built tactile sensors into bionic hands: Signals from a sensor on the thumb went to an electrode implanted around the ulnar nerve on people’s arms. Three people who had lost a hand tested the bionic hands and felt a touch when the thumb was prodded, but the touch felt as if it came from somewhere else on the hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors can choose which nerve an electrode will stimulate. But they don’t know in advance which bundle of fibers it will affect within the nerve, Bensmaia explains. And different bundles receive and supply sensations to different parts of the hand. Even after the people had used the prosthesis for more than a year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472031528X&quot;&gt;the mismatch didn’t improve&lt;/a&gt;. The brain didn’t adapt to correct the sensation. The team shared its findings last December in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite that, in previous studies, those same people using the bionic hands had better precision and more control over their force when grasping objects, compared with those using versions without direct stimulation of the nerve. People getting the direct nerve stimulation also reported feeling as if the hand was more a part of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with the bionic hands, advances in haptic technology probably won’t start out working perfectly. Indeed, virtual hugs and other simulated touch experiences may never be as good as the real thing. Yet haptics may help us get a feel for the future, with new ways to explore our world and stay in touch with those we love.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: X-ray scans explain how the ‘Brazil nut effect’ works</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-nut-effect-mixed-nuts-xray-scan-physics</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new experiment reveals, in a nutshell, why the largest particles in some mixtures tend to gather at the top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is known as the Brazil nut effect, since jostling mixed nut packages tends to bring bulky Brazil nuts to the top. The effect can also be seen in cereal boxes and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/explain-asteroid-composition-scientists-invoke-nuts&quot;&gt;space rocks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/15/14&lt;/em&gt;). Understanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87280-1&quot;&gt;how it works&lt;/a&gt; could help manufacturers create more uniform mixtures of ingredients for food processing, or more even distributions of active ingredients in medicine tablets, researchers report April 19 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brazil nut effect has been tough to crack because it’s difficult to track how individual objects move around in the middle of a mixture, says Parmesh Gajjar, an imaging scientist at the University of Manchester in England. Using X-ray CT scans, Gajjar and colleagues followed the motion of individual peanuts and Brazil nuts in a box as it was shaken back and forth — creating the first 3-D videos of the Brazil nut effect in action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;X-ray CT scans of a jumble of Brazil nuts (yellow) and peanuts (red on left, translucent on right) reveal how the Brazil nut effect works. As the box of mixed nuts is shaken, the Brazil nuts gradually shift into a more vertical orientation. This allows peanuts to tumble down around them, pushing the Brazil nuts higher in the pile.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the videos, the Brazil nuts, which are oblong, mostly laid horizontally when they were first dumped into the container. But as the box shook, collisions between nuts nudged some of the Brazil nuts to point more vertically. That vertical orientation opened up space for the smaller peanuts higher in the mixture to tumble down and accumulate at the bottom, pushing the Brazil nuts upward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this finding could satisfy the curiosity of mixed nut aficionados, that’s peanuts compared to the practical use it could have for the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Fast radio bursts could help solve the mystery of the universe’s expansion</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-bursts-universe-expansion-hubble-constant</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have been arguing about the rate of the universe’s expansion for nearly a century. A new independent method to measure that rate could help cast the deciding vote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, astronomers calculated the Hubble constant — the rate at which the universe is expanding — from observations of cosmic flashes called fast radio bursts, or FRBs. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04538&quot;&gt;the results are preliminary and the uncertainties are large&lt;/a&gt;, the technique could mature into a powerful tool for nailing down the elusive Hubble constant, researchers report April 12 at arXiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if the uncertainties in the new method can be reduced, it could help settle the long-standing debate that holds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis&quot;&gt;our understanding of the universe’s physics&lt;/a&gt; in the balance (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I see great promises in this measurement in the future, especially with the growing number of detected repeated FRBs,” says Stanford University astronomer Simon Birrer, who was not involved with the new work.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Astronomers typically measure the Hubble constant in two ways. One uses the cosmic microwave background, the light released shortly after the Big Bang, in the distant universe. The other uses supernovas and other stars in the nearby universe. These approaches currently disagree by a few percent. The new value from FRBs comes in at an expansion rate of about 62.3 kilometers per second for every megaparsec (about 3.3 million light-years). While lower than the other methods, it’s tentatively closer to the value from the cosmic microwave background, or CMB.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our data agrees a little bit more with the CMB side of things compared to the supernova side, but the error bar is really big, so you can’t really say anything,” says Steffen Hagstotz, an astronomer at Stockholm University. Nonetheless, he says, “I think fast radio bursts have the potential to be as accurate as the other methods.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly what causes FRBs, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts&quot;&gt;eruptions from highly magnetic neutron stars&lt;/a&gt; are one possible explanation &lt;em&gt;(SN: 6/4/20)&lt;/em&gt;. During the few milliseconds when FRBs blast out radio waves, their extreme brightness makes them visible across large cosmic distances, giving astronomers a way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts&quot;&gt;to probe the space between galaxies&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/27/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an FRB signal travels through the dust and gas separating galaxies, it becomes scattered in a predictable way that causes some frequencies to arrive slightly later than others. The farther away the FRB, the more dispersed the signal. Using measurements of this dispersion, Hagstotz and colleagues estimated the distances to nine FRBs. Comparing those distances to the speeds at which the FRBs’ host galaxies are receding from Earth, the team calculated the Hubble constant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The largest error in the new method comes from not knowing precisely how the FRB signal disperses as it exits its home galaxy before entering intergalactic space, where the gas and dust content is better understood. With a few hundred FRBs, the team estimates that it could reduce the uncertainties and match the accuracy of other methods such as supernovas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a first measurement, so not too surprising that the current results are not as constraining as other more matured probes,” says Birrer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New FRB data might be coming soon. Many new radio observatories are coming online and larger surveys, such as ones proposed for the Square Kilometre Array, could discover tens to thousands of FRBs every night. Hagstotz expects there will sufficient FRBs with distance estimates in the next year or two to accurately determine the Hubble constant. Such FRB data could also help astronomers understand what’s causing the bright outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am very excited about the new possibilities that we will have soon,” Hagstotz says. “It’s really just beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: A new technique could make some plastic trash compostable at home</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-compost-new-enzyme-technique-biodegradable</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A pinch of polymer-munching enzymes could make biodegradable plastic packaging and forks truly compostable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With moderate heat, enzyme-laced films of the plastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03408-3&quot;&gt;disintegrated &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03408-3&quot;&gt;in standard compost or plain tap water&lt;/a&gt; within days to weeks, Ting Xu and her colleagues report April 21 in &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Biodegradability does not equal compostability,” says Xu, a polymer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She often finds bits of biodegradable plastic in the compost she picks up for her parents’ garden. Most biodegradable plastics go to landfills, where the conditions aren’t right for them to break down, so they degrade no faster than normal plastics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embedding polymer-chomping enzymes in biodegradable plastic should accelerate decomposition. But that process often inadvertently forms potentially harmful microplastics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest&quot;&gt;which are showing up in ecosystems across the globe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). The enzymes clump together and randomly snip plastics’ molecular chains, leading to an incomplete breakdown. “It’s worse than if you don’t degrade them in the first place,” Xu says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her team added individual enzymes into two biodegradable plastics, including polylactic acid, commonly used in food packaging. They inserted the enzymes along with another ingredient, a degradable additive Xu previously developed, which ensured the enzymes didn’t clump together and didn’t fall apart. The solitary enzymes grabbed the ends of the plastics’ molecular chains and ate as though they were slurping spaghetti, severing every chain link and preventing microplastic formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;vials of tap water containing new plastic filament before and after degradation&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098937&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042121_cd_compostplastic_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098937&quot;&gt;Filaments of a new plastic material degrade completely (right) when submerged in tap water for several days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098937&quot;&gt;Adam Lau/Berkeley Engineering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding enzymes usually makes plastic expensive and compromises its properties. However, Xu’s enzymes make up as little as 0.02 percent of the plastic’s weight, and her plastics are as strong and flexible as one typically used in grocery bags.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technology doesn’t work on all plastics because their molecular structures vary, a limitation Xu’s team is working to overcome. She’s filed a patent application for the technology, and a coauthor founded a startup to commercialize it. “We want this to be in every grocery store,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common
firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they
represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to
determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features
of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells
indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial
arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal
dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a
computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to
investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that
trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives
sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially
on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the
number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a
graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in
terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are
several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur
preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et
al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a
simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our
observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst
duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This
possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for
correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Unmet Sexual Needs Can Leave People Less Satisfied With Their Relationship — But Having A Responsive Partner Mitigates This Effect</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/21/unmet-sexual-needs-can-leave-people-less-satisfied-with-their-relationship-but-having-a-responsive-partner-mitigates-this-effect/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For better or worse, romantic partners usually have to rely heavily on each other to fulfil their sexual needs.” So begins a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-14418-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; that attempts to plug a gap in understanding sexual ideals — and what might buffer against dissatisfaction if reality doesn’t quite match.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sexual incompatibilities are not only common, but are difficult to resolve even with couples therapy, note Rhonda N. Balzarini at York University and colleagues in their paper in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes&lt;/em&gt;. Despite this, there’s been only limited work to understand precisely what constitutes an individual’s ideal sex life. Earlier work has generally focused on narrow aspects, such as how often a person would ideally like to have sex, or on levels of sexual desire. For this new research, the team developed a broader, 30-item Sexual Ideals Scale, which asks about specific behaviours (“My partner engages in oral sex with me as much as I want my ideal partner to”, for example) but also about the importance of feeling safe and in love, or of dirty talk, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41853&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study involved 207 members of mixed-sex couples from Canada and the US who had been in a relationship for at least four months. Both members of each couple took part. As well as the new Sexual Ideals Scale, they independently completed measures of sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, commitment to their partner and also their “sexual communal strength”. Someone high in sexual communal strength is more motivated to meet their partner’s needs “even when those needs are different from their own”. Such a person is likely to be perceived as being more responsive, even if their partner’s sexual ideals aren’t being met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This first study showed, unsurprisingly, that when people report unmet sexual ideals in their relationship, both they and their partner reported lower sexual and relationship satisfaction. However, among those with unmet sexual ideals, people with a sexually communal partner reported higher levels of both types of satisfaction. The results for men and women were very similar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also ran daily diary-based studies, which revealed that on days when people reported having more unmet sexual ideals than typical, both they and their partner reported lower levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction and commitment. There were long-term effects, too: more unmet sexual ideals over a three-week period were associated with reductions in both types of satisfaction for both partners three months later. The results couldn’t be explained by the participants’ reports of sexual frequency or levels of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that people hold ideals about their sexual relationship — and when these ideals are not met, there are negative consequences. However, again, the data suggested that having a sexually communal partner mitigated this. In a final experimental study, the team found that participants who’d been led to believe that their sexual ideals were not being met reported lower levels of both types of satisfaction &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if they rated their partner as low for sexual communal strength, but not if this score was high. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with sexually communal partners may not feel that their sexual ideals are being entirely met, but their partner’s behaviour may make this feel less of a problem, the researchers suggest. Perhaps their partner is supportive when declining their sexual advances, or more willing to compromise, or offer other forms of affection when they’re not interested in sex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interventions aimed at addressing sexual compatibilities are scarce, the team notes. Since the new research suggests that if both members of a couple make more of an effort to be responsive, this could reduce or even overcome relationship difficulties caused by mismatched sexual ideals, this does at least suggest an approach to try. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-14418-001&quot;&gt;The detriments of unmet sexual ideals and buffering effect of sexual communal strength.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The already tiny neutrino’s maximum possible mass has shrunk even further</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-max-possible-mass-tiny-new-estimate-particle-physics</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand neutrinos, it pays to be small-minded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The subatomic particles are so lightweight, they’re almost massless. They’re a tiny fraction of the mass of the next lightest particle, the electron. But scientists still don’t know exactly how slight the particles are. A new estimate from the KATRIN experiment, located in Karlsruhe, Germany, further shrinks the maximum possible mass neutrinos could have.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The puny particles have masses of &lt;a href=&quot;http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR21/Session/Q14.6&quot;&gt;0.8 electron volts or less&lt;/a&gt;, physicist Diana Parno reported April 19 at a virtual meeting of the American Physical Society. For comparison, electrons are more than 600,000 times as bulky, at about 511,000 electron volts. “Neutrino masses are tiny,” said Parno, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The KATRIN experiment studies tritium, a rare form of hydrogen that decays radioactively, emitting an electron and an antimatter mirror image of the neutrino, an antineutrino. Measuring the energies of the electrons can reveal the masses of the antineutrinos that flitted away.  That’s because mass and energy are two sides of the same coin; a more massive neutrino would mean less energy could go to the electron in the decay&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-experiment-slashes-maximum-possible-mass-tiny-neutrinos&quot;&gt;previous estimate&lt;/a&gt; from KATRIN, using a smaller amount of data, found that the neutrino’s mass was less than 1.1 electron volts (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/18/19&lt;/em&gt;). In the coming years, additional data should further squeeze the neutrino’s maximum possible bulk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists still don’t understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quest-identify-nature-neutrinos-alter-ego-heating&quot;&gt;why neutrinos are abnormally light&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/26/18&lt;/em&gt;). The origin of the particle’s mass remains mysterious: While most fundamental particles obtain their masses from interacting with what’s called the Higgs field — as revealed by the discovery of its particle manifestation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found&quot;&gt;the Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt;, in 2012 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/4/12&lt;/em&gt;) — neutrinos may get their masses in a different manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Neutron stars may not be as squishy as some scientists thought</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-stars-pulsar-density-diameter-matter</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Like a dried-up lemon from the back of the fridge, neutron stars are less squeezable than expected, physicists report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New measurements of the most massive known neutron star find that it has a surprisingly large diameter, suggesting that the matter within isn’t as squishy as some theories predicted, physicists with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, reported April 17 at a virtual meeting of the American Physical Society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a dying star explodes, it can leave behind a memento: a remnant crammed with neutrons. These neutron stars are extraordinarily dense — like compressing Mount Everest into a teaspoon, said NICER astrophysicist Zaven Arzoumanian of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “We don’t know what happens to matter when it’s crushed to this extreme point.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more massive the neutron star, the more extreme the conditions in its core. Jammed together at tremendous densities, particles may form unusual states of matter. For example, particles known as quarks — usually contained within protons and neutrons — may roam freely in a neutron star’s center.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The core’s composition determines its squeezability. For example, if quarks are free agents within the most massive neutron stars, the immense pressure will compress the neutron star’s core more than if quarks remain within neutrons. Because of that compressibility, for neutron stars, more mass doesn’t necessarily translate to a larger diameter. If neutron star matter is squishy, the objects could counterintuitively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-dwarf-stars-shrink-size-gain-mass&quot;&gt;shrink as they become more massive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/12/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand how neutron star innards respond to being put through the cosmic wringer, scientists used the X-ray telescope NICER aboard the International Space Station to estimate the diameters of rapidly spinning neutron stars called pulsars. In 2020, NICER &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-glimpses-pulsar-surface-hint-complex-magnetism&quot;&gt;sized up a pulsar&lt;/a&gt; with a mass about 1.4 times the sun’s: It was about 26 kilometers wide (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/3/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have now gauged the girth of the heftiest confirmed neutron star, with about 2.1 times the mass of the sun. But the beefy neutron star’s radius is about the same as its more lightweight compatriot’s, according to two independent teams within the NICER collaboration. Combining NICER data with measurements from the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton satellite, one team found a diameter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR21/Session/E03.3&quot;&gt;around 25 kilometers&lt;/a&gt; while the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR21/Session/E03.4&quot;&gt;estimated 27 kilometers&lt;/a&gt;, physicists reported in a news conference and in two talks at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many theories predict that the more massive neutron star should have a radius that is smaller. “That it is not tells us that, in some sense, the matter inside neutron stars is not as squeezable as many people had predicted,” said astrophysicist Cole Miller of the University of Maryland in College Park, who presented the second result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a bit puzzling,” said astrophysicist Sanjay Reddy of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the research. The finding suggests that inside a neutron star, quarks are not confined within neutrons, but they still interact with one another strongly, rather than being free to roam about unencumbered, Reddy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measurements reveal another neutron star enigma. Pulsars emit beams of X-rays from two hot spots associated with the magnetic poles of the pulsar. According to the textbook picture, those beams should be emitted from opposite sides. But for both of the neutron stars measured by NICER, the hot spots were in the same hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It implies that we have a somewhat complex magnetic field,” said NICER astrophysicist Anna Watts of the University of Amsterdam, who presented the first team’s result. “Your beautiful cartoon of a pulsar … is for these two stars completely wrong. And that’s brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the beams of a newly measured pulsar (illustrated) come from the same hemisphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098890&quot;&gt;NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Editor’s tips for passing journal checks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/uuA7LujvZ4Y/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You’ve painstakingly mapped out your research goal: to answer that unanswered question. You’ve conducted your experiments, analyzed the results and written your paper. Now it’s off to a journal. And the process begins. PLOS editors have seen it all and want to help get your paper published as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does the journal office look for, and what are the potential pitfalls? More importantly, how can you ensure that your manuscript passes journal checks and moves on to peer review quickly? Here, PLOS staff discuss a few of the most common reasons why a manuscript is rejected during the initial technical check, and how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, after a manuscript is submitted to a scientific journal it undergoes a series of technical and ethical checks. Submissions that pass this initial screening go on to editorial assessment and peer review. Submissions that don’t meet requirements, or don’t provide enough information, may be returned to the authors for clarification. This can extend review times and even lead to a manuscript being rejected without review. Below are 5 checks and tips on how to smoothly get past them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #1: Sense check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, does the manuscript make sense as a submission? Is it a scientific article? Are all the typical parts of an article (abstract, introduction, methods, results/discussion, figures citations) all present? Is the language clear and understandable?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your manuscript is complete, and that the writing is clear and unambiguous. Note that it doesn’t have to be perfect at this stage, just precise enough for fellow researchers in your field to understand and evaluate your work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-edit-your-work/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to editing your work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #2: Journal fit and scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e20e8e3d0d&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Kendall-765x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Journals tend to specialize in particular subjects and types of studies. “The biggest reason we reject without review is scope.” Explains Kendall McKenzie, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt; “&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt;Our scope page&lt;/a&gt; breaks down the diseases and categories of research we’re interested in, and even specifically states the kinds of things we don’t consider.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; It comes down to submitting the right manuscript to the right publication. Carefully investigate the journal’s scope before submitting to ensure that your manuscript has a good chance of publication. If your particular article is on the edge of the journal’s expressed scope, or if you’re just not sure, search the journal for similar articles; if there are no comparable publications, your study is likely out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-choose-journal/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to choosing a journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #3: Acceptance criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2137e3d0e&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Laura-1024x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Laura Simmons, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics &lt;/em&gt;agrees. “In addition to scope, our Editors in Chief and Section Editors may reject without review if a submission is lacking in biological or mechanistic insight (i.e. if it is too descriptive), or if the research doesn’t represent a significant advance in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; This one is all about doing your research. Different journals have different criteria for publication. Consult the journal website and consider whether your study fulfills the requirements and mission of the journal. Does the journal publish the type of research your study describes? Will your article appeal to the readers the journal serves? If not, consider a more specialized publication that focuses specifically on the type of research you are conducting, or, alternatively, a journal with a broader, more inclusive scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #4: Plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2181e3d0f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Emma.jpg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most journals run an automated check that looks for similarities between your manuscript and previously published works. If the manuscript scores above a certain threshold, members of the journal staff will take a closer look at your manuscript to ensure that any direct quotes are framed within quotation marks and properly cited. “Overall the most common issue we see is authors reusing their own methods section, introduction, or conclusion from previous or related studies,” explains &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Publishing Editor Emma Stillings. Authors don’t always realize that “you have to cite everyone, even yourself, to avoid any delay in the peer review process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Any direct quotes &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;be framed within quotation marks and properly attributed. That includes your own prior works. Try to avoid reusing text, and especially copy-pasting from your other papers. Check to make sure that any summaries or allusions are properly cited as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #5: Complete and consistent ethical, funding, data, and other statements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the statements in the submission form are unclear, lacking detail, or otherwise incomplete, the process will pause while the journal office contacts the authors for more information. Similarly, if the statements within the manuscript are different from those in the submission system, the journal office will work with the authors to reconcile them before the manuscript can advance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Label and save the paperwork from the early part of your research process: funding information, committee approval documents, permits, permission forms, patient disclosure statements, study designs, and any other materials. You may need them to complete your submission form. When you are ready to submit, proofread carefully to ensure that everything in your manuscript is up-to-date and clear. Double check to make sure that any placeholder text has been replaced with the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final words of wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to familiarize yourself with a journal before submitting. What’s the scope of the journal? What article types do they publish? Are you adhering to the guidelines for that particular article type? Making sure you’re informed about what type of work the journal publishes and how, can go a long way in deciding where to submit and speeding your manuscript through the initial submission stages.” &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eclancy@plos.org&quot;&gt;Eileen Clancy&lt;/a&gt;, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Videocalling needed more than a pandemic to finally take off. Will it last?</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-call-zoom-pandemic-popularity-phone-tech-history</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eileen Donovan, an 89-year-old mother of seven living in a Boston suburb, loved watching her daughter teach class on Zoom during the coronavirus pandemic. She never imagined Zoom would be how her family eventually attended her funeral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Donovan died of Parkinson’s disease on June 30, 2020, leaving behind her children, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She always wanted a raucous Irish wake. But only five of her children plus some local family could be there in person, and no extended family or friends, due to coronavirus concerns. This was not the way they had expected to mourn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For online attendees, the ceremony didn’t end with hugs or handshakes. It ended with a click on a red “leave meeting” button, appropriately named for business meetings, but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the same button that Eileen Donovan-Kranz, Donovan’s daughter, clicks when she finishes an English lecture for her class of undergraduate students at Boston College. And it’s the same way she and I ended our conversation on an unseasonably warm November day: Donovan-Kranz sitting in front of a window in her dining room in Ayer, Mass., and me in my bedroom in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to hold the phone during my mother’s burial,” she remembers thinking. Just a little over a year ago, it would have seemed absurd to have to ask someone to hold up a smartphone so that others could “attend” such a personal event. Donovan-Kranz asked her daughter’s fiancé to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the way people interact with each other and with technology. Screens were for reminiscing over cherished memories, like watching VHS tapes or, more recently, YouTube videos of weddings and birthdays that have already happened. But now, we’re not just watching memories. We’re creating them on screens in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As social distancing measures forced everyone to stay indoors and interact online, multibillion-dollar industries have had to rapidly adjust to create experiences in a 2-D world. And although this concept of living our lives online — from mundane work calls to memorable weddings or concerts — seems novel, both scientists and science fiction writers have seen this reality coming for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In David Foster Wallace’s 1996 novel &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, videotelephony enjoys a brief but frenzied popularity in a future America. Entire industries emerge to address people’s self-consciousness on camera. But eventually, the industry collapses when people realize they prefer the familiar voice-only telephone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple efforts by inventors and entrepreneurs to convince us that videoconferencing had arrived, that reality didn’t play out. Time after time, people rejected it for the humble telephone or for other innovations like texting. But in 2020, live video meetings finally found their moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took more than just a pandemic to get us here, some researchers say. Technological advances over the decades together with the ubiquity of the technology got everyone on board. But it wasn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Initial attempts&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On June 30, 1970 — exactly half a century before Donovan’s death — AT&amp;amp;T launched what it called the nation’s first commercial videoconferencing service in Pittsburgh with a call from Peter Flaherty, the city’s mayor, to John Harper, chairman and CEO of Alcoa Corporation, one of the world’s largest producers of aluminum. Alcoa had already been using the Alcoa Picturephone Remote Information System for retrieving information from a database using buttons on a telephone. The data would be presented on the videophone display. This was before desktop computers were ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was not AT&amp;amp;T’s first videophone, however. In 1927, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover had demonstrated a prototype developed by the company. But by 1972, AT&amp;amp;T had a mere 32 units in service in Pittsburgh. The only other city offering commercial service, Chicago, hit its peak sales in 1973, with 453 units. AT&amp;amp;T discontinued the service in the late 1970s, concluding that the videophone was “a concept looking for a market.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;group photo of people at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1927&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098784&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_videophone_inline-1-1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098784&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T President Walter Sherman Gifford (third from right) makes a videocall at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City on April 7, 1927. The call went to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover in Washington, D.C., via 300 miles of long-distance wire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098784&quot;&gt;Federal Communications Commission/PhotoQuest/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a decade after AT&amp;amp;T’s first attempt at commercialization, a band called the Buggles released the single “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first music video to air on MTV. The song reminded people of the technological change that occurred in the 1950s and ’60s, when U.S. households transitioned away from radio as televisions became more accessible to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way television achieved market dominance kept videophone developers bullish about their technology’s future. In 1993, optimistic AT&amp;amp;T researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;amp;arnumber=6771094&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; “the 1990s will be the video communication decade.” Video would change from something we passively consumed to something we interacted with in real time. That was the hope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When AT&amp;amp;T launched its VideoPhone 2500 in 1992, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120623220545/http:/www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/videophone.pdf&quot;&gt;prices started at a hefty $1,500&lt;/a&gt; (about $2,800 in today’s dollars) — later dropping to $1,000. The phone had compressed color and a slow frame rate of 10 frames per second (Zoom calls today are 30 frames per second), so images were choppy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the company tried to enchant potential customers with visions of the future, people weren’t buying it. Fewer than 20,000 units sold in the five months after the launch. Rejection again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Building capacity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last June, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of AT&amp;amp;T’s first videophone launch, William Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, and Michael G. Morris, Alcoa’s chairman at the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.videocall50th.com/event&quot;&gt;spoke over videophone&lt;/a&gt;, just as their predecessors had done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several scholars, including Andrew Meade McGee, a historian of technology and society at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, joined for an online panel to discuss the rocky history of the videophone and its 2020 success. McGee told me a few months later that two things are crucial for a product’s actual adoption: “capacity and circumstance.” Capacity is all about the technology that makes a product easy to use and affordable. For videophones, it’s taken a while to get there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the Picturephone, which was launched by AT&amp;amp;T and Bell Telephone Laboratories, premiered at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York City, a three-minute call cost $16 to $27 (that’s about $135 to $230 in 2021). It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-1643&quot;&gt;available only in booths in New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/1/64, p. 73&lt;/em&gt;). Using the product required planning, effort and money — for low reward. The connection required multiple phone lines and the picture appeared on a black-and-white screen about the size of today’s iPhone screens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;man and woman watching Lady Bird Johnson on a prototype AT&amp;amp;T videophone&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098783&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042521_videophone_inline-3-680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098783&quot;&gt;Lady Bird Johnson, who was then first lady of the United States, is visible on the screen of a prototype AT&amp;amp;T videophone in 1964.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098783&quot;&gt;Everett Collection Historical/Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges made the Picturephone a tough sell. Marketing researchers Steve Schnaars and Cliff Wymbs of Baruch College at the City University of New York &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162502004109?casa_token=KwREbNHUlZgAAAAA:uf9dBQIB1ANWNhgOSB26zQAwIlHcxOyR_L84BJAOZTvj-IuHtmJSWzzPLu4K63RHVL8TcIgq&quot;&gt;theorized why videophones hadn’t taken off&lt;/a&gt; decades before in &lt;em&gt;Technological Forecasting and Social Change &lt;/em&gt;in 2004. Along with capacity and circumstance, they argued, critical mass is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a technology to become popular, the researchers wrote, everybody needs the money and motivation to adopt it. And potential users need to know that others also have the device — that’s the critical mass. But when everyone uses this logic, no one ends up buying the new product. Social networking platforms and dating apps face the same hurdle when they launch, which is why the apps create incentive programs to hook those all-important initial users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Internet access&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even in the early 2000s, when Skype made a splash with its Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, enabling internet-based calls that left landlines free, people weren’t as connected to the internet as they are today. In 2000, only 3 percent of U.S. adults &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/media/Files/Reports/2010/Home-broadband-2010.pdf&quot;&gt;had high-speed internet&lt;/a&gt;, and 34 percent had a dial-up connection, according to the Pew Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2019, the story had changed: Seventy-three percent of all U.S. adults &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/&quot;&gt;had high-speed internet at home&lt;/a&gt;; with 63 percent coverage in rural areas. Globally, the number of internet users also increased, from about 397 million in 2000, to about 2 billion in 2010 and 3.9 billion in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Broad reach &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access to high-speed, broadband internet has risen among U.S. adults, across all age groups. The data shown are for at-home use, excluding internet access via smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even after capacity was established, we weren’t glued to our videophones as we are today, or as inventors predicted years ago. Although Skype &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-skype-modernized-its-backend-infrastructure-using-azure-cosmos-db-part-1/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have 300 million users in 2019, Skype was a service that people typically used on occasion, for international calls or as something that took advance planning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One long-time barrier that the Baruch College researchers cite from an informal survey is the aversion to always being “on.” Some people would have paid extra to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be on camera in their home, the same way people would pay extra to have their phone numbers left out of telephone books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once people experienced [the 1970s] videophone, there was this realization that maybe you don’t always want to be on a physical call with someone else,” McGee says. Videocalling developers had predicted these challenges early on. In 1969, Julius Molnar, vice president at Bell Telephone Labs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that people will be “much concerned with how they will appear on the screen of the called party.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scene from the 1960s cartoon&lt;em&gt; The Jetsons &lt;/em&gt;illustrates this concern: George Jetson answers a videophone call. When he tells his wife Jane that her friend Gloria is on the phone, Jane responds, “Gloria! Oh dear, I can’t let her see me looking like this.” Jane grabs her “morning mask” — for the perfect hair and face — before taking the call.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That aversion to face time is one of the factors that kept people away from videocalling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took the pandemic, a change in circumstance, to force our hand. “What’s remarkable,” McGee says, “is the way in which large sectors of U.S. society have all of a sudden been thrust into being able to use videocalls on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Circumstance shift&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting in March 2020, mandatory stay-at-home orders around the world forced us to carry on an abridged form of our pre-pandemic lives, but from a distance. And one company beat the competition and rose to the top within a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after lockdown, Zoom became a verb. It was the go-to choice for all types of events. The perfect storm of capacity and circumstance led to the critical mass needed to create the Zoom boom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before Zoom, a handful of companies had been trying to fill the space that AT&amp;amp;T’s videophone could not. Skype became the sixth most downloaded mobile app of the decade from 2010 to 2019. FaceTime, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and Google’s videochatting applications were and still are among the most popular platforms for videocalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then 2020 happened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zoom beat its well-established competitors to quickly become a household name globally. It gained critical mass over other platforms by being easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The fact that it’s been modeled around this virtual room that you come into and out of really simplifies the connection process,” says Carman Neustaedter of the School of Communication, Art and Technology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, where his team has researched being present on videocalls for work, home and health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zoom reflects our actions in real life — where we all walk into a room and everyone is just there. Casual users don’t need to have an account or connect ahead of time with those we want to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond design, there were likely some market factors at play as well. Zoom connected early with universities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.zoom.us/campus-technology-zoom-classroom/&quot;&gt;claiming by 2016&lt;/a&gt; to be at 88 percent of “the top U.S. universities.” And just as K–12 schools worldwide started closing last March, Zoom offered free unlimited meeting minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, Zoom statistics put its maximum number of daily meeting participants (both paid and free) at about 10 million. In March 2020, that number &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/&quot;&gt;had risen to 200 million&lt;/a&gt;, and the following month it was up to 300 million. The way Zoom counts those users is a point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Zoom peak daily meeting participants&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 96px; font-weight: 300; margin: 10px; line-height: 70%;&quot;&gt;10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h5 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;million&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;December 2019&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 96px; font-weight: 300; margin: 10px; line-height: 70%;&quot;&gt;200&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h5 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;million&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;March 2020&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 96px; font-weight: 300; margin: 10px; line-height: 70%;&quot;&gt;300&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h5 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;million&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;April 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these numbers still provide some insight: If the product wasn’t easy and helpful, we wouldn’t have kept using it. That’s not to say that Zoom is the perfect platform, Neustaedter says. It has some obvious shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost too rigid,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t allow for natural conversation; participants have to take turns talking, toggling the mute button to let others take a turn. Even with the ability to send private and direct messages to anyone in the room, the natural way we form groups and make small talk in real life is lost with Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also not the best for parties — it’s awkward to attend a birthday party online when only one out of 30 friends can talk at a time. That’s why some people have been enticed to switch to other videocalling platforms to host larger online events, like graduations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, Remo, founded in 2018, uses visual virtual rooms. Everyone gets an avatar and can choose a table after seeing who else is there, to talk in smaller groups. Instead of Zoom breakout sessions where you’re assigned a room and can’t enter another one on your own, a platform like Remo allows you to virtually see all the rooms and pick one, exit it and go to another one all without the help of a host.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rigidity also results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychological-exploration-zoom-fatigue&quot;&gt;Zoom fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, that feeling of burnout associated with overusing virtual platforms to communicate. Videocalling doesn’t allow us to use direct eye contact or easily pick up nonverbal cues from body language — things we do during in-person conversations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The psychological rewards of videocalling — the chance to be social — don’t always outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Bailenson, director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford University, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1&quot;&gt;laid out four features that lead to Zoom fatigue&lt;/a&gt; in the Feb. 23 &lt;em&gt;Technology, Mind and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;. Along with cognitive load and reduced mobility, he blames the long stretches of closeup eye gazing and the “all-day mirror.” When you constantly see yourself on camera interacting with others, self-consciousness and exhaustion set in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bailenson has since changed his relationship with Zoom: He now hides the box that lets him view himself, and he shrinks the size of the Zoom screen to make gazing faces less imposing. Bailenson expects minor changes to the platform will help reduce the psychological heaviness we feel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other challenges with Zoom have revolved around security. In April 2020, the term “Zoombombing” arose as teleconferencing calls on the platform were hijacked by uninvited people. Companies that could afford to switch quickly moved away from Zoom and paid for services elsewhere. For everyone else who stayed on the platform, Zoom added close to 100 new privacy, safety and security features by July 2020. These changes included the addition of end-to-end encryption for all users and meeting passcodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Anybody’s guess&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Metropolis, &lt;/em&gt;the 1927 sci-fi silent film, a master of an industrial city in the dystopian future uses four separate dials on a videophone to put a call through. Thankfully, placing a videocall is much easier than it was predicted to be. But how much will we use this far-from-perfect technology once the pandemic is over?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;em&gt;Productivity and the Pandemic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/productivity-and-the-pandemic-9781800374591.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in January, behavioral economist Stuart Mills discusses why consumers might keep using videocalling. This pandemic may establish habits and preferences that will not disappear once the crisis is over, Mills, of the London School of Economics, and coauthors write. When people are forced to experiment with new behaviors, as we did with the videophone during this pandemic, the result can be permanent behavioral changes. Collaboration through videocalling may remain popular even after shutdowns lift now that we know how it works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Events that require real-life interactions, such as funerals and some conferences, may not change much from what we were used to pre-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For other industries, videocalling may change certain processes. For example, Reverend Annie Lawrence of New York City predicts permanent changes for parts of the wedding industry. People like the ease of getting a marriage license online, and she’s been surprisingly in demand doing video weddings since the pandemic started. Before, getting booked for officiating a wedding would require notice months in advance. “Now, I’ve been getting calls on Friday to ask if I can officiate a wedding on Saturday,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other sectors of society may realize that videocalling isn’t for them, and will leave just a few processes to be done online. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, for example, stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8-eUse5hg8&amp;amp;t=507s&quot;&gt;a March 1 interview with Bloomberg Markets&lt;/a&gt; and Finance that he thinks a large portion of his staff will permanently work in the office when that becomes possible again. Culture is hard to build on Zoom, relationships are hard to strengthen and spontaneous collaboration is difficult, he said. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2021/03/designing-the-hybrid-office&quot;&gt;there’s research that backs this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But none of these changes or reversions to our previous normal are a sure bet. We may find, just like in Wallace’s satirical storyline, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://hsc.unm.edu/school-of-medicine/education/assets/doc/wellness/murphy-why-zoom-is-terrible-nyt.pdf&quot;&gt;videocalls are just too much stress&lt;/a&gt;, and the world will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/clubhouse-beats-instagram-tiktok-zoom-whatsapp-in-app-stores-worldwide&quot;&gt;revert back to phone calls&lt;/a&gt; and face-to-face time. We may realize that even when the technology gets better, the lifting of shutdowns and return to in-person life may mean fewer people are available for videocalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say which scenario is the most likely to play out in the long run. We’ve been terribly wrong about these things before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Describing Groups To Children Using Generic Language Can Accidentally Teach Them Social Stereotypes</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/20/describing-groups-to-children-using-generic-language-can-accidentally-teach-them-social-stereotypes/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we talk to children about the characteristics of boys and girls, our word choice and syntax can profoundly shape what they take away from the conversation. Even attempts to dispel stereotypes can backfire: as we recently reported, telling kids that girls are “as good as” boys at maths &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;can actually leave them believing that boys are naturally better&lt;/a&gt; at the subject and that girls have to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other work has shown that “generic” language can also perpetuate stereotypes: saying that boys “like to play football”, for instance, can make children believe that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; boys like to play football, or that liking football is a fundamental part of being a boy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953132&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that when kids hear this kind of generic language, they don’t just make assumptions about the group that is mentioned — they also make inferences about &lt;em&gt;unmentioned&lt;/em&gt; groups. That is, if children hear that boys like to play football, they might deduce that girls do not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41838&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To examine these kinds of inferences, Kelsey Moty and Marjorie Rhodes from New York University first asked 287 kids aged 4 to 6 to watch a video about a town that is home to two groups of people: “zarpies” and “gorps”. First, a narrator introduced these groups, outlining a few of their characteristics (zarpies, for instance, “like to climb tall fences”, while gorps “like to draw stars on their knees”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids then saw more zarpies and gorps, while hearing either generic or specific statements about them. A generic statement, for instance, would be “zarpies are good at baking pizza”, while a specific statement would be “this zarpie is good at baking pizza”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participants saw another zarpie and another gorp, and were asked whether each of these were good at baking pizza (or whatever activity the statement had been about).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consistent with past work, kids who had heard the generic statement were more likely than those who had heard the specific statement to infer that the new zarpie was good at baking pizza. But these participants were also more likely to infer that the new gorp was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;good at baking pizza. That is, generic language seemed to lead the children to make assumptions even about members of the unmentioned group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these inferences were made by kids as young as 4-and-a-half. And as the children got older, the more likely they were to make them: almost all 7-year-olds who had heard the generic statement said that the new zarpie was good at baking pizza and that the new gorp was not good at baking pizza (a group of adults also made near unanimous judgements along these lines).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Could it simply be that the children had been shown two apparently contrasting groups, so just assume that a gorp must be the opposite of a zarpie in all ways? A later study suggests that this isn’t the case. In this experiment, the video was presented either by a knowledgeable narrator who lived in the neighbourhood, or an unknowledgeable one who was visiting for the first time.  The children again made inferences about the unmentioned group based on generic statements — but only when the speaker was knowledgeable. This suggests that children actually reason about what a speaker knows and what information they intend to convey, in order to make their inferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then the work suggests that children (like adults) &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;make inferences about unmentioned categories when they hear generic statements — particularly if they think that the speaker knows what they’re talking about. So it’s easy to see how generic language could inadvertently perpetuate gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, the researchers didn’t explicitly test the kids’ beliefs about boys and girls: they used the fictional groups of zarpies and gorps instead, precisely so the kids wouldn’t be influenced by existing stereotypes. But it would still be interesting to know whether children make similar inferences about boys and girls — perhaps researchers could try and minimise the influence of existing stereotypes by using fictional activities instead (for instance, if kids were told that girls were good at “plarping”, what would they think about a boy’s plarping skills?). Still, the study provides yet another striking example of how the way we speak to children shapes their beliefs about social groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953132&quot;&gt;The Unintended Consequences of the Things We Say: What Generic Statements Communicate to Children About Unmentioned Categories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House Conference on Youth voted to legalize the sale of grass (with restrictions). On the same day, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; published an article condemning the use of marijuana by the young.… The researchers conclude that marijuana smoking is particularly harmful to the adolescent. It adds unnecessary anxieties to the already disturbing problems of physical and psychological maturation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifty years after the recommendation to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, at least 15 U.S. states have done so. In that time, a growing body of research has strengthened the link between teen marijuana use and mental health effects, including an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2723657&quot;&gt;increased risk of depression&lt;/a&gt; later in life. Such health concerns partly explain why people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iihs.org/topics/alcohol-and-drugs/marijuana-laws-table&quot;&gt;younger than 21&lt;/a&gt; are prohibited from recreationally using pot. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-many-us-kids-are-vaping-marijuana&quot;&gt;pot use is prevalent among U.S. middle and high school students&lt;/a&gt;: About 25 percent of students in grades 8, 10 and 12 disclosed using the drug in 2020, scientists report.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Here’s what we know about B.1.1.7, the U.S.’s dominant coronavirus strain</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-b117-variant-us-dominant-strain</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, health officials in the United Kingdom announced that a new coronavirus variant was rapidly spreading across the region. Weeks later, U.S. officials found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread&quot;&gt;the first case&lt;/a&gt; in the United States (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/22/20&lt;/em&gt;). And by early April, the variant had become the most common form of the coronavirus identified across the country, an event that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;warned in January&lt;/a&gt; might happen (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/21&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news came amid a surge in coronavirus cases in many states, including Michigan, where the new variant, dubbed B.1.1.7, makes up nearly 58 percent of genetically screened &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions&quot;&gt;samples collected as of March 27&lt;/a&gt;. The variant is less prevalent in California, New York and other states, where homegrown versions of concerning coronavirus variants are currently causing the majority of cases instead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the emergence of the variant in the United Kingdom, scientists have worked to get a handle on how mutations in the virus’s genetic blueprint might change its behavior, amid concerns that the virus might have gained the ability to evade vaccines or cause more severe disease. Here’s what researchers have learned so far about B.1.1.7.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;B.1.1.7 is 40 to 70 percent more transmissible than other variants.&lt;/h4&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Rapid spread of the coronavirus among people in a corner of London that was linked to the emergence of a variant was what first raised health officials’ concerns. In the months since, multiple studies support that initial finding that B.1.1.7 is more contagious than previous versions of the virus, on the order of around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00383-4&quot;&gt;40 to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current hypothesis for why the variant is more transmissible is that a mutation in the spike protein — which helps the coronavirus break into cells — allows the virus to attach more tightly to the cellular protein that lets it enter a new cell. That leads to a higher amount of virus in the body and a more transmissible virus, says Eleni Nastouli, a clinical virologist at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that B.1.1.7 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251535v1&quot;&gt;hangs out in the body for longer&lt;/a&gt; than other variants, giving people more time to transmit it. Or it could cause certain symptoms, such as a cough, more frequently, which might help the virus spread. A study conducted through the U.K. Office for National Statistics, for example, previously found that those infected with the variant were slightly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19infectionsinthecommunityinengland/characteristicsofpeopletestingpositiveforcovid19inengland27january2021&quot;&gt;more likely to have cough, sore throat, fatigue or muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;. But a more recent study counters those results. Among 36,920 people living in the United Kingdom who used an app to report COVID-19 symptoms, there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00055-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;no differences in symptoms linked to B.1.1.7&lt;/a&gt; compared with ones caused by other versions of the coronavirus, researchers report April 12 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need a bit more work to find out what’s really going on,” says Mark Graham, a medical imaging expert at King’s College London who led the new work. But overall, there are no dramatic changes, he explains. “It’s not like suddenly you don’t get loss of smell with B.1.1.7 or anything like that. All the key symptoms are there.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Overall, B.1.1.7 is probably more lethal, too.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One worrying trait that has emerged is that B.1.1.7 seems to be more lethal than other versions of the coronavirus. Infection with the variant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03426-1&quot;&gt;raises the risk of death overall&lt;/a&gt; by around 60 percent, studies suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zeroing in on hospitalized patients, a group at high risk of death, however, reveals &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00170-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;no link between infections with B.1.1.7 and risk of severe disease or death&lt;/a&gt;, Nastouli and her colleagues report April 12 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. “That is obviously a positive message,” Nastouli says. Still, “it doesn’t mean that it is a less deadly virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because B.1.1.7 spreads more easily than other variants, meaning it can infect more people, some of whom will die. More are likely to end up in the hospital, compared with previous variants, “but the moment that you come to the hospital, you having the variant doesn’t make a difference in terms of your outcome of severity and death,” Nastouli says. The researchers didn’t see an increased risk of death even after adjusting for factors such as age, underlying conditions or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That finding still fits with the current evidence hinting that the virus is more deadly overall, says Nicholas Davies, an evolutionary biologist and epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, studies done outside of the United Kingdom are needed to confirm the results, Davies and Nastouli say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vaccines — and prior infection — still appear to protect people from B.1.1.7.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although some mutations seen in B.1.1.7 raised concerns that the variant could dodge parts of the immune response, evidence is building that vaccines and previous infections are still protective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The April 12 &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health &lt;/em&gt;study, for instance, did not find evidence that B.1.1.7 caused a surge in reinfections in the United Kingdom as the variant rose to dominance in December 2020, Graham says. “That might suggest that B.1.1.7 is not able to evade immunity that people have acquired from infections to previous strains.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent data from Israel — a country that has vaccinated more than half its population — also suggest that B.1.1.7 is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254882v1&quot;&gt;infecting people who are fully vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab&lt;/a&gt;, instead primarily infecting those who are unvaccinated or partially immunized, researchers report in a preliminary study posted April 9 at medRxiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, for now, “we don’t really have to worry about alternative vaccines” for B.1.1.7, Graham says. Current vaccines “do work against it.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Researchers have their eyes on other variants.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While B.1.1.7 poses threats because of its rapid spread and increased risk of hospitalization, other variants are also worrisome. That’s in part because while vaccines still appear to work for B.1.1.7, the shots might be less effective against other variants of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies done in lab dishes hint that a variant called B.1.351, first identified in South Africa, can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges&quot;&gt;evade some antibodies&lt;/a&gt; from vaccinated people or those who had been infected with other variants (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/27/21&lt;/em&gt;). But the immune response is multifaceted, so researchers need data from the real world to pinpoint the effect on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study in Israel found that people fully vaccinated with Pfizer’s shot were more likely to be infected with B.1.351 compared with other variants. But there were few cases with B.1.351 overall, suggesting the actual odds of infection are still unknown. In a small trial in South Africa with 800 participants, however, where B.1.351 is prevalent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious&quot;&gt;nine out of nine COVID-19 cases were in people who did not receive Pfizer’s shot&lt;/a&gt;, the pharmaceutical company announced April 1. That hints that the shot is likely still effective against B.1.351, which caused six of those cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another variant dubbed P.1, found in Brazil, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-p1-variant-brazil-strain-transmission-immunity&quot;&gt;appears to be more transmissible&lt;/a&gt; than earlier strains (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/14/21&lt;/em&gt;). People who have already recovered from COVID-19 have around 54 to 79 percent of protection against P.1 as they do against other variants circulating in the country. It is still unclear how protective currently authorized vaccines might work against P.1. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s particularly worrisome as COVID-19 cases are climbing in countries such as Brazil and India. A variant with two key mutations thought to increase transmission and allow the virus to evade the immune response, for instance, was recently identified in India and has since spread to other countries. Amid such surges, additional new variants could emerge, which may put the end of the pandemic further out of reach.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Opinions Based On Feelings Are Surprisingly Stable</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/19/opinions-based-on-feelings-are-surprisingly-stable/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emotional states can be fleeting and somewhat inexplicable — you can feel great one minute and down in the dumps the next, sometimes for no apparent reason. It follows, then, that opinions based on emotion are likely to be equally fleeting: if you’re in a bad mood when you take part in a survey or review a product, then surely the attitudes measured and recorded will be just as transient too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to a series of studies by Matthew D. Rocklage from the University of Massachusetts Boston and Andrew Luttrell from Ball State University, this isn’t actually the case. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620965532&quot;&gt;they report in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attitudes based in emotion are actually &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; stable: the more emotional an opinion, the less it changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41833&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, participants were asked to think of three gifts they had recently received, before selecting their attitude towards the gift from a list of adjectives, some overtly negative, some overtly positive and some neutral, such as “amazing”, “boring”, “terrifying”, or “valuable”. Participants listed gifts ranging from electric toothbrushes to Star Wars figurines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One month later, participants were asked to think of the same gifts and again select adjectives that represented their feelings about them. After the second part of the study, the adjectives chosen by participants were coded for positive or negative valence, extremity, and emotionality. (Although these may seem similar, emotionality relates to how much an attitude is based on emotion, while extremity measures the extent to which an attitude is positive or negative; “outstanding”, for example, has high emotionality but low extremity.)      &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those participants who chose more extreme adjectives, whether positive or negative, were less likely to see a change in the valence of the adjectives used to describe their gifts at the second time point. Similarly, the more an attitude was based on emotion, the less it changed too. A second study, which looked at attitudes towards brands, also found that emotionally-based attitudes changed less over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third study looked at attitudes in a more naturalistic setting: reviews of products posted online. The team obtained all reviews for all restaurants in Chicago over a period of twelve years, looking only at reviewers who had posted more than one review of the same establishment. The team then analysed both the emotional valence of the reviews and measured any differences in the number of stars the reviewers gave the restaurants at each time point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in previous studies, &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; emotionality consistently predicted less change in attitude across time, though negative emotionality did not. Positive extremity also predicted less change in attitude, while negative extremity predicted more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at whether exposure to messages designed to evoke emotions actually increase the likelihood of people developing fixed attitudes. To do this, the team assigned participants to two conditions. In one, they saw a message about a fictional aquatic animal called the “lemphur” designed to elicit high emotion, reading about a touching underwater encounter between the creature and a diver. In the low emotion condition, participants read a fact-based message about the lemphur similar to an encyclopedia entry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reading the text, participants indicated their attitude towards the animal, selecting from the same list of adjectives used in the first study. In follow-up studies over the next few days, participants selected adjectives again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the high-emotion condition were, unsurprisingly, more likely to indicate a more emotional response to the animal than those in the low-emotion condition, and also had a more &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; response. Those in the high-emotion condition also saw less change in their attitude towards the creature over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, emotional responses were related to more fixed attitudes. Notably, positive emotionality had a particularly strong effect, which may be a useful to know for the creation of public health messaging or other attempts at attitude change — inducing positive emotions, rather than negative emotions like shame, may be more beneficial. Whether positive emotions have a similar effect on actual behaviour, rather than just attitudes, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620965532&quot;&gt;Attitudes Based on Feelings: Fixed or Fleeting?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter made history by flying on Mars</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: This story has been updated with details of Ingenuity’s second and third flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A helicopter just flew on Mars. NASA’s Ingenuity hovered for about 40 seconds above the Red Planet’s surface, marking the first flight of a spacecraft on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wee hours on April 19, the helicopter spun its carbon fiber rotor blades and lifted itself into the thin Martian air. It rose about three meters above the ground, pivoted to look at NASA’s Perseverance rover, took a picture, and settled back down to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Goosebumps. It looks just the way we had tested it in our test chambers,” Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung said in a news briefing after the flight. “Absolutely beautiful flight. I don’t think I can ever stop watching it over and over again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As data from the flight started coming in to Ingenuity’s mission control room at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif., at about 6:35 a.m. EDT, a hush fell. And then cheers erupted as Håvard Grip, Ingenuity’s guidance, navigation and control lead, announced: “Confirmed that Ingenuity has performed its first flight, the first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of the Ingenuity helicopter's shadow during its first flight&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098843&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/041921_lg_ingenuity_hovershadow_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098843&quot;&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter took this photo of its own shadow while hovering about three meters in the Martian air on April 19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098843&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing, brilliant. Everyone is super excited,” said mechanical engineer and team member Taryn Bailey. “I would say it’s a success.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flight, originally scheduled for April 11, was delayed to update the helicopter’s software after a test of the rotor blades showed problems switching from preflight to flight mode. After the reboot, a high-speed spin test April 16 suggested the shift was likely to work, setting the stage for the April 19 flight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I never let you celebrate fully. Every time we hit a major milestone I’m like, not yet, not yet,” Aung told the team moments after the flight was confirmed. Now is the moment to celebrate, she said. “Take that moment and after that, let’s get back to work and more flights. Congratulations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Ingenuity lifted into the thin Martian atmosphere for the first time on April 19, proving that flight is possible on another planet. This video was taken by the Perseverance rover, which watched from a safe distance away.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This first-ever flight was a test of the technology; Ingenuity won’t do any science during its mission, set to last 30 Martian days from the moment it separated from the rover, the equivalent of 31 days on Earth. But its success proves that powered flight is possible in Mars’ thin atmosphere. Future aerial vehicles on Mars could help rovers or human astronauts scout safe paths through unfamiliar landscapes, or reach tricky terrain that a rover can’t traverse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Technology demonstrations are really important for all of us,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “It’s taking a tool we haven’t been able to use and putting it in the box of tools we have available for all of our missions at Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity’s flight was the culmination of more than seven years of imagining, building, testing and hoping for the flight team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That is what building first-of-a-kind systems and flight experiments are all about: design, test, learn from the design, adjust the design, test, repeat until success,” Aung said in a news briefing on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aung and her team began testing early prototypes of a Mars helicopter in a 7.62-meter-wide test chamber at JPL in 2014. It wasn’t a given that flying on Mars would even be possible, Aung said. “It’s challenging for many different reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Before it hitched a ride to Mars on the rover Perseverance, Ingenuity underwent extensive testing in a Mars simulator on Earth. Its engineers experimented with early prototypes and later with Ingenuity itself. These tests convinced the team that the craft could fly in Mars’ thin atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though Mars’ gravity is only about one-third of Earth’s, the air’s density is about 1 percent that at sea level on Earth. It’s difficult for the helicopter’s blades to push against that thin air hard enough to get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about it is that the air is thinner on Mars than it is at three times the height of Mount Everest, Ingenuity engineer Amelia Quon of JPL said in the news briefing. “We don’t generally fly things that high,” Quon said. “There were some people who doubted we could generate enough lift to fly in that thin Martian atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Quon and her team put the helicopter through a battery of tests over the course of five years. “My job … was to make Mars on Earth, and enough of it that we could actually fly our helicopter in it,” Quon said. The Mars simulation chamber could be emptied of Earth air and pumped full of carbon dioxide at Mars-like densities. Some versions of the helicopter were suspended from the ceiling to simulate Mars’ lower gravity. And wind speeds up to 30 meters per second were simulated by a bank of about 900 computer fans blowing at the helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The final version of Ingenuity is light, about 1.8 kilograms. Its blades are longer (about 1.2 meters wingspan) and rotate faster (about 2,400 rotations per minute) than a similar vehicle would need to be able to fly on Earth. By the time the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mission-mars-launch&quot;&gt; helicopter hitched a ride to Mars with the Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, the engineers were confident the helicopter could fly and remain in control at Mars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perseverance&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-audio&quot;&gt; landed in a region called Jezero crater&lt;/a&gt; on February 18 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/21&lt;/em&gt;). The helicopter was folded up beneath Perseverance’s belly under a protective shield until March 21.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, Perseverance drove around to find a flat spot for Ingenuity to launch. Then Ingenuity slowly unfolded itself and was finally lowered gently to the ground beneath Perseverance on April 3. The rover drove away quickly to get Ingenuity out of its shadow and allow the helicopter to charge its batteries with its solar panel, giving it enough power to survive the freezing Martian night. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Perseverance unpacking the Ingenuity helicoper&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098833&quot; height=&quot;479&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/041821_ingenuity_unpacking.gif&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098833&quot;&gt;Ingenuity arrived on Mars folded up under the Perseverance rover in a protective shield the size of a pizza box. After landing, Perseverance dropped the shield and slowly lowered Ingenuity to the ground, then drove away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098833&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On April 8 and 9, Ingenuity unfolded its rotor blades and tested their ability to spin in preparation to take to the air. After trouble-shooting the software problem and retesting the rotor blades April 16, the flight got a green light for April 19. It was scheduled for roughly 3:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 19, which corresponds to 12:30 p.m. Mars time, in the early afternoon. That gave the craft’s solar panel enough time to charge up its batteries for the flight. It was also a time when Perseverance’s weather sensors, called MEDA, suggested the average wind speed would be about six meters per second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ingenuity testing its rotors on Mars&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098836&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040921_lg_Ingenuity-helicopter_inline1_680.gif&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098836&quot;&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter tested its spinning rotor blades on April 8, a week and a half before taking flight in the thin Martian air for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098836&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity had to pilot itself through the flight. That’s partly because of the communication delay — Mars is far enough from Earth that light signals take about 15 minutes to travel between the two planets. But it’s also because Mars’ thin air makes the helicopter difficult to steer. “Things happen too quickly for a human pilot to react to it,” Quon said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perseverance filmed the flight from about 65 meters away, at a spot named Van Zyl Overlook. Ingenuity also filmed the flight from its own perspective, with two sets of cameras: Its downward facing navigation cameras capturing the view below it in black and white, and its color cameras scanning the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;selfie image of Perseverance rover with Ingenuity helicopter in the background&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098837&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040921_lg_Ingenuity-helicopter_inline2_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098837&quot;&gt;Over several days, NASA’s Perseverance rover gently lowered the Ingenuity helicopter to the ground and then took this selfie with it on April 6 from about four meters away. The rover then drove off to a safe distance of 65 meters to get ready to watch Ingenuity’s first flight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098837&quot;&gt;MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team hopes to take up to four more flights over the course of Ingenuity’s mission. The second flight took place early on April 22. Ingenuity rose five meters into the air, tilted to fly two meters sideways, and spun around to take pictures of its surroundings before landing safely. On the third flight on April 25, Ingenuity flew farther and faster than ever before, even in tests on Earth. The helicopter rose five meters into the air and sped 50 meters horizontally, reaching two meters per second at top speed. The Perseverance rover filmed Ingenuity as it flew in and out of the rover’s field of view, then stuck the landing.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each subsequent flight will be a little bit more daring and riskier. “We are going to continually push all the way to the limit of this rotorcraft,” Aung said in the April 19 news briefing. And each one will be a nail-biter: Just one bad landing could end things immediately. Ingenuity has no way to right itself after a fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That may be the way the mission ends, Aung admitted. “Ultimately, we expect the helicopter will meet its limit,” she said. Even if it eventually wipes out in a crash, the engineering team will learn valuable information from how the helicopter eventually fails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of Ingenuity’s mission, Perseverance will drive off, leaving the little helicopter that could behind, and continue its own mission: to search for signs of past life in Jezero crater, and to store rocks for a future mission to return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649494254/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serial killers—people who repeatedly murder others—provoke revulsion but also a certain amount of fascination in the general public. But what can modern psychology and neuroscience tell us about what might be going on inside the head of such individuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial killers characteristically lack empathy for others, coupled with an apparent absence of guilt about their actions. At the same time, many can be superficially charming, allowing them to lure potential victims into their web of destruction. One explanation for such cognitive dissonance is that serial killers are individuals in whom two minds co-exist—one a rational self, able to successfully navigate the intricacies of acceptable social behaviour and even charm and seduce, the other a far more sinister self, capable of the most unspeakable and violent acts against others. This view has been a powerful stimulus in fictional portrayals ranging from &lt;em&gt;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&lt;/em&gt;, to Hitchcock’s &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt;, and a more recent film, &lt;em&gt;Split&lt;/em&gt;. Yet there is little evidence that real-life serial killers suffer from dissociative identity disorder (DID), in which an individual has two or more personalities cohabiting in their mind, apparently unaware of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, DID is a condition more associated with victims, rather than perpetrators, of abuse, who adopt multiple personalities as a way of coming to terms with the horrors they have encountered. Of course a perpetrator of abuse may also be a victim, and many serial killers were abused as children, but in general they appear not to be split personalities, but rather people conscious of their acts. Despite this, there is surely a dichotomy in the minds of such individuals perhaps best personified by US killer Ted Bundy, who was a “charming, handsome, successful individual [yet also] a sadist, necrophile, rapist, and murderer with zero remorse who took pride in his ability to successfully kill and evade capture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a recent brain imaging study … showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between … a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One puzzling aspect of serial killers’ minds is the fact that they appear to lack—or can override—the emotional responses that in other people allows us to identify the pain and suffering of other humans as similar to our own, and empathise with that suffering. A possible explanation of this deficit was identified in a recent brain imaging study. This showed that criminal psychopaths had decreased connectivity between the amygdala—a brain region that processes negative stimuli and those that give rise to fearful reactions—and the prefrontal cortex, which interprets responses from the amygdala. When connectivity between these two regions is low, processing of negative stimuli in the amygdala does not translate into any strongly felt negative emotions. This may explain why criminal psychopaths do not feel guilty about their actions, or sad when their victims suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet serial killers also seem to possess an enhanced emotional drive that leads to an urge to hurt and kill other human beings. This apparent contradiction in emotional responses still needs to be explained at a neurological level. At the same time, we should not ignore social influences as important factors in the development of such contradictory impulses. It seems possible that serial killers have somehow learned to view their victims as purely an object to be abused, or even an assembly of unconnected parts. This might explain why some killers have sex with dead victims, or even turn their bodies into objects of utility or decoration, but it does not explain why they seem so driven to hurt and kill their victims. One explanation for the latter phenomenon is that many serial killers are insecure individuals who feel compelled to kill due to a morbid fear of rejection. In many cases, the fear of rejection seems to result from having been abandoned or abused by a parent. Such fear may compel a fledgling serial killer to want to eliminate any objects of their affections. They may come to believe that by destroying the person they desire, they can eliminate the possibility of being abandoned, humiliated, or otherwise hurt, as they were in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial killers also appear to lack a sense of social conscience. Through our parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and other individuals who influence us as we grow up, we learn to distinguish right from wrong. It is this that inhibits us from engaging in anti-social behaviour. Yet serial killers seem to feel they are exempt from the most important social sanction of all—not taking another person’s life. For instance, Richard Ramirez, named the “Night Stalker” by the media, claimed at his trial that &lt;em&gt;“you don’t understand me. You are not expected to. You are not capable of it. I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil … I don’t believe in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this so-called civilized society.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains far from clear why a few people react to abuse or trauma at an earlier stage in their lives by later becoming a serial killer. But hopefully new insights into the psychological or neurological basis of their actions may in the future help us to identify potential future such killers and dissuade them from committing such horrendous crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/vectors/psycho-shower-stabbing-knife-kill-303435/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649494254/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649494254/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649494254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Disability, access, and the virtual conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>xcorr.net: Is early vision like a convolutional neural net?</title>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2021/04/16/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early convolutional neural net (CNNs) architectures like the Neocognitron, LeNet and HMAX were inspired by the brain. But how much like the brain are modern CNNs? I made a pretty strong claim on Twitter a few weeks ago that the early visual processing is nothing like a CNN:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;CNNs are better models of vision than transformers. But you know what's funny? Early vision is nothing like a CNN. There are no mechanisms to tie weights from one neuron to another. Resolution varies with eccentricity. Features maps vary across space. So why do they look similar? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&quot;&gt;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1377685962067746820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In typical Twitter fashion, my statement was a little over-the-top, and it deserved a takedown. What followed was a long thread of replies from Blake Richards, Grace Lindsay, Dileep George, Simon Kornblith, members of Jim DiCarlo’s lab, and even Yann LeCun. The different perspectives are interesting, and I’m curating them here. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My position, in brief, is that weight sharing and feature maps – the defining characteristics of modern CNNs – are crude approximations of the topography of the early visual cortex and its localized connection structure. Whether this distinction matters in practice depends on what you want your models to accomplish – I argue that for naturalistic vision, it can matter a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several defining characteristics of modern CNNs:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selectivity operations (i.e the ReLU)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pooling operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Localized receptive fields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feature maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight sharing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where did these ideas come from?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hubel and Wiesel (1962) described simple and complex cells in the cat primary visual cortex. Simple cells respond best to a correctly oriented bar or edge. Complex cells, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the sign of the contrast of the bar or edge, or its exact location. They hypothesized that simple cells are generated by aggregating the correct LGN afferents selective for light and dark spots, followed by the threshold nonlinearity of the cells. Complex cells were hypothesized to be generated by pooling from similarly tuned simple cells. They later expanded these ideas: perhaps first-order and second-order hypercomplex cells are created by the repetition of the same pattern. Thus, hierarchy, selectivity, pooling and localized receptive fields were all hypothesized to be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adapted from (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). | Download Scientific Diagram&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomaso-Poggio-2/publication/265923351/figure/fig2/AS:669389284200460@1536606250398/Adapted-from-Hubel-and-Wiesel-1962.ppm&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;Annotated figures from Hubel &amp;amp; Wiesel (1962)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima (1980) adapted many of these ideas in a self-organized hierarchical neural network called the Neocognitron. In the S-layers, neurons weight the input from previous layers via localized receptive fields, followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. In C-layers, inputs from the previous are pooled linearly, followed by a sigmoid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7587&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7587&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-1.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1648,1044&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-1-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-1.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From Fukushima (1980)&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Neocognitron also introduces what may be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; defining features of modern CNNs: parallel feature maps (here called planes) and weight sharing. This is most clearly seen in the selectivity operation for S-layers, which is a convolution over the set of local coordinates &lt;img alt=&quot;S_l&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_l&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt;, followed by a ReLU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the introduction of parallel feature maps and weight sharing is not very clear in the original paper, and in fact in section 3 the paper casts doubt on how realistic these assumptions are as a model of vision:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the basic hypotheses employed in the neocognitron is the assumption that all the S-cells in the same S-plane have input synapses of the same spatial distribution, and that only the positions of the presynaptic cells shift in parallel in accordance with the shift in position of individual S-cell’s receptive fields. It is not known whether modifiable synapses in the real nervous system are actually self-organized always keeping such conditions. Even if it is assumed to be true, neither do we know by what mechanism such a self-organization goes on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why introduce these features at all?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Topography conquers all&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima however links localized receptive fields with the idea of localized topography:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] orderly synaptic connections are formed between retina and optic tectum not only in the development in the embryo but also in regeneration in the adult amphibian or fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one of the enduring facts of visual neuroscience: inputs from the retina are preserved topologically as they make their way to the LGN, V1, and onwards to extrastriate cortex. Visual angle and log radius are mapped from the retina to V1 in development, guided by chemical gradients. The progression of the maps reverse as we go up the visual hierarchy (in fact, areas are defined by this very reversal in direction). What’s remarkable is how precise the topography is: Hubel and Wiesel estimated that in primary visual cortex, neighbouring cells varied in receptive field center by less than half a receptive field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIG. 1.&quot; height=&quot;-587&quot; src=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/cms/10.1152/jn.01202.2003/asset/images/large/z9k0070439721001.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;-305&quot; /&gt;From Ringach (2004)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another fact of life in cortex, which is that horizontal wiring is expensive. If a neuron integrates from localized inputs, and those inputs are retinotopically organized, that neuron will have a localized receptive field. If you assume that the synaptic pattern is localized and random then for every cell, there must be other similarly tuned cells somewhere else in the visual field. My postdoc advisor Dario &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01202.2003&quot;&gt;Ringach introduced a model (2004)&lt;/a&gt; for how simple cells in primary visual cortex can occur from such sparse localized connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That covers feature maps. However, if the input statistics to primary visual cortex are stationary, then a self-supervised criterion could refine a randomly initialized V1 feature map, effectively letting the input do the weight tying – a subtle point brought up by Blake Richards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Non-stationarities at the large scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope to have convinced you that the link between CNNs, first introduced by Fukushima, and early visual processing in the brain is quite subtle. Whether a CNN is a good or a bad model of early visual processing depends on what phenomenon we care to model. If we’re talking about core visual recognition in the parafovea – which is what the majority of the quantification comes from – the match is quite good. At larger spatial scales, however, I would argue that the match is compromised by two facts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, spatial resolution is not constant as a function of space. A CNN on a Cartesian grid doesn’t scale with eccentricity. This issue has received some attention lately, and foveating CNNs are starting to be considered – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/forum?id=2_Z6MECjPEa&quot;&gt;this recent paper from Arturo Deza and Talia Konkle for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/26196&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/26196%2Felife-26196-fig9-v1.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg&quot; width=&quot;459&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spatial frequency tuning correlates with spatial tuning. From Arcaro and Livingstone (2017)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the eyes foveate towards interesting targets – e.g. faces – which mean that statistics are highly nonstationary different as a function of space. The ground looks very different from the sky. Hands tend to be in the lower half of the visual field, and numerous visual areas have only partial maps of the visual field. There’s overrepresentation of radial orientations, more curvature selectivity in the fovea, no blue cones in the fovea, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture to illustrate this. If VGG19 is a good model of primary visual visual cortex, then it follows that maximizing predicted activity in primary visual cortex could be done by maximizing an unweighted sum of VGG19 subunits, a la DeepDream. If you do that for layer 7 of VGG19, you get the picture on the left. However, we can use fMRI to estimate a matrix, via ridge regression that maps VGG19 to an fMRI subspace, and then optimize a weighted sum of VGG19 subunits, giving us the picture on the right. This image highlights some of the known spatial biases in primary visual cortex – shifts in prefered spatial frequency as a function of eccentricity, radial bias, curvature bias in the fovea – which are not apparent in an unweighted VGG19. So at the very least, the brain’s image manifold is rotated and rescaled compared to the VGG19 image manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margaret Livingstone has a very interesting line of research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_YTcec9Z0&quot;&gt;talk here&lt;/a&gt;) highlighting the close link between spatial biases and the development of object and face recognition modules in high-level visual cortex. More generally, if we’re interested in how vision is organized for action – ecological vision in the tradition of Gibson – then whether a network has captured, e.g. the fact that the bottom half of the visual field has very different affordances than the top half matters. If you applied a unsupervised criterion to learn features from natural images without weight sharing, those features would vary quite a bit across space – unlike in a CNN. This point was also raised by Dileep George.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Weight sharing is not strictly necessary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) demonstrates the use of backpropagation to train a convolutional image recognition network. There’s a beautiful figure that highlights the effect of adding more and more constraints, in particular in going from a fully-connected 2-layer network (net2) to a high-capacity convolutional neural net (net5):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7584&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7584&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1496,1026&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8/&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From LeCun (1989)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) clarifies that weight sharing is a clever trick that decreases the number of weights to be learned, which in the small data limit is practically important to obtain good test set accuracy. We are a long ways from 1989 in terms of dataset size, and unsupervised learning could learn untied feature maps, as pointed out by Yann LeCun in the Twitter thread. But would currently existing benchmarks favor ANNs-with-local-receptive-field-but-untied-weights?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The leaderboard is the message&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn back to the claim that early visual cortex is like a particular CNN. As Wu, David and Gallant (2006) put it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;an important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience [is] developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brain-score.org/&quot;&gt;Brain-Score&lt;/a&gt; is an embodiment of this idea – benchmark, across many different datasets and ventral stream areas, the ability of many different CNNs to explain brain activity. The leaderboard is pretty clear that the VGG19 architecture outperform alternatives in explaining average firing rate – even when these alternatives are better at classifying images in ImageNet. That’s an interesting finding – VGG19 is shallower and has larger receptive fields than more modern CNNs, so perhaps its performance on this benchmark is because of that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grace Lindsay pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] when the results were first coming out that trained convolutional neural networks are good predictors of activity in the visual system some people had the attitude of “that’s not interesting because obviously anything that does vision well will look like the brain”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that we now have architectures that solve object recognition which are very different from CNNs, namely visual transformers (ViT). They are architecturally different from brains, and they while they perform well on ImageNet, they underperform in predicting single neuron responses. So now we have a clear example of a disconnect between ImageNet performance and similarity to the brain, and that strengthens the claim that core object recognition is like a CNN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the one hand, the data from BrainScore says that CNNs are the best models of core object recognition, yet there are pretty stark ways in which early visual processing is unlike a CNN, some of which I’ve mentioned already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07092&quot;&gt;others which have been highlighted in Grace Lindsay’s excellent review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Would Brain-Score, in theory, rate better a model which respects the distinction between excitation and inhibition (Dale’s law)? That seems unlikely, since there are no cell type annotations in the datasets. Would it rate better a foveated model, or one that doesn’t have weight sharing? Again, unlikely, since as Tiago Marques points out, for technical reasons, most datasets are taken in the parafovea. In any case, the metric used to score the models is rotation invariant, so it wouldn’t be able to tell these cases apart. As Simon Kornblith points out, choices of metrics are not falsifiable. The right approach for choosing metrics is the axiomatic one, as demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414&quot;&gt;Simon’s CKA paper&lt;/a&gt;: the modeller or the community decides what the right metric is based off of design criterias that represent what they think is interesting about the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does that mean we should ignore Brain-Score? No! I really like Brain-Score – I wish there were many more Brain-Score-like leaderboards! Comparing on lots of datasets prevents cherry picking – there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/&quot;&gt;robustness in the meta-analytic approach&lt;/a&gt;. What I’m excited about is the possibility of Brain-Scores – a constellation of leaderboards that benchmark different models according to rules which match on modeler’s interests. I’ve been involved in proto-community-benchmark efforts like the neural prediction challenge and spikefinder before, and the technological barriers to run such a leaderboard have been lowered by commoditized cloud infra. The value proposition is also becoming clearer, and I am excited to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurallatents.github.io/&quot;&gt;more of these efforts pop up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In brief:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convolutional neural nets assume shared weights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This assumption is not valid at large spatial scales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large spatial scales matter if you care about naturalistic foveated vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a useful assumption in the low-data regime, which we’re not in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current benchmarks are not sensitive to this issue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s possible and desirable to create new benchmarks which are sensitive to this, and I hope to do that in the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s wrong to say that introverts have fared better during the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/have-introverts-really-fared-better-in-lockdown-158800&quot;&gt;writes Lis Ku&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, studies have shown that in many ways introverts’ wellbeing has suffered more than that of extraverts. This could be because extraverts may have more social support, for instance, or because extraversion is related to superior coping strategies — although Ku emphasises that there are likely many other traits, beliefs and values that are also important in determining people’s response to lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new trial suggests that the psychedelic drug psilocybin could be as good as existing antidepressant drugs at treating depression, when it is combined with psychotherapy. &lt;/strong&gt;However, researchers caution that more work with larger, more diverse samples is needed before the drug could be used outside of a research setting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/14/magic-mushroom-psilocybin-show-promise-treatment-depression-clinical-trial-finds&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The team suspects that this is because there are fewer cognitive demands placed on an ant whose primary job is simply to reproduce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/science/ants-brains-queen.html&quot;&gt;reports Annie Roth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times, &lt;/em&gt;so energy that would be going to the workers’ brains is better spent on the reproductive system instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomedical and public health research should reflect the diversity of global health and the impact that social, cultural, and geographical factors can have on local health practice and policy. Until now, no studies have examined the contribution of developing countries to authors, editors or research in high-ranking neurology journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for research in neurology cannot be understated. Globally, neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30411-9&quot;&gt;low and middle-income countries bear almost 80% of the burden of neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. As the population continues to grow, the degree of burden will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess representation in neurology journals, we conducted a cross-sectional study of all research articles published in 2010 and 2019 in the five highest ranked peer-reviewed neurology journals: &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Neurology, Acta Neuropathologica, Nature Reviews Neurology, Brain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;. Using this data, we determined the extent of contributions of authors, editors, and research from developing countries, as well as the degree of international research collaboration between developed and developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare, and this has not changed in the past decade. First authorship was attributed to authors from developing countries in only 2% of research articles in 2010 and 3% in 2019. The lack of representation in research extends to the editorial boards of the selected journals, none of which had a board member from a developing country. Unsurprisingly, the primary data of these publications originated largely from developed countries with advanced research facilities, namely the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling underrepresentation in research is no simple feat. Nevertheless, our results highlight that there is an urgent need for strategies to support high-quality locally-driven biomedical research in developing countries. Local researchers in developing countries benefit from exposure to greater research opportunities, education, and training. This is beneficial to developing countries as they are able to direct socially and culturally relevant research that is readily applicable to local healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity through greater representation via international collaborations which strengthen the quality of research in developing countries. By fostering high-quality and culturally relevant research, local healthcare systems are able to readily apply these findings to meet the neurological needs of their population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Good Time Management Seems To Have A Bigger Impact On Wellbeing Than Work Performance</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our lives have become busier, desire to do things quickly and efficiently has grown — something the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/08/speed-reading-apps-can-you-really-read-novel-in-your-lunch-hour&quot;&gt;rise of speed reading apps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/14/eating-lunch-at-your-desk-again-study-examines-why-workers-dont-always-take-breaks/&quot;&gt;lack of break-taking at work&lt;/a&gt;, and a general focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0920-z&quot;&gt;“productivity”&lt;/a&gt; has shown. Good time management skills, therefore, are now highly prized both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But do such techniques actually work? In &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245066&quot;&gt;a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brad Aeon from Concordia University and colleagues find that they do — but perhaps not for the reasons you’d expect. While time management skills have become more important in evaluations of job performance since the 1990s, their biggest impact lies elsewhere: in personal wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41815&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time management, in brief, is a decision-making framework that helps us structure, protect and adapt our time in changing circumstances. It can therefore be measured through questions like “do you have a daily routine?”, “do you find it hard to say no to people?” and “do you evaluate your daily schedule?”. Work-life balance and attitudes to time and time management are also key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore the efficacy of time management, the team collated 158 papers from the mid-1980s to 2019 in journals in business, computing, gender studies, psychology, sociology and education; papers that included scales or questionnaires on time management were also included. (Interestingly, time management studies became more popular between 2000 and the 2010s, suggesting a wider trend and interest in the topic.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies included work on time management in academia and the workplace, individual differences in time management, and its impact on wellbeing factors such as life satisfaction, anxiety, depression, and positive and negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By looking at the effects across all of these studies, the team found that time management has a moderate, positive impact on work performance, both in terms of performance appraisal by managers and factors like motivation and involvement with work. The relationship between time management and job performance became stronger over the years the studies were published, another suggestion that time management has become a more important factor in people’s lives. This link was not as strong in academic settings — time management seemed to be less relevant to tests scores or grades than it was to performance reviews at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most individual differences were only weakly associated with time management skills: women have stronger time management skills than men, for instance, but this correlation was weak. Women’s time management skills did grow over the timeline of the meta-analysis, however perhaps a sign of more busy schedules and increased juggling of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite narratives that suggest time management is primarily a work or career-based skill, the strongest link was between good time management and wellbeing: the effect of time management on life satisfaction was 72% stronger than on job satisfaction. Time management also reduced feelings of distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall the findings suggest that time management does work — though contrary to popular belief, it is &lt;em&gt;wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; that is the most positively impacted factor, not work. Work and wellbeing are clearly linked — if you’re having a horrible time at work your life satisfaction is unlikely to be too high. But the results could mean that wellbeing is not simply a byproduct of a successfully managed work life but can be a direct result of good time management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may not want to put too much stock in time management alone, however: being good at time management, the team argues, is often a function of privilege. Things like income, class and education all influence how we are able to manage our time. They use the meme-ified phrase that “you have as many hours in the day as Beyoncé” to illustrate their point: while technically true, Beyoncé has a full team of nannies, drivers, chefs, personal trainers and more to manage her time and thus has the hours of their day as well as hers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those without such resources are unlikely to achieve as much as someone who does, and shaming them for lack of attainment is unhelpful. And though time management skills may be invaluable in a busy life, it’s also useful to remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/november-2020/you-are-more-your-productivity&quot;&gt;the words of Dr Maria Kordowicz&lt;/a&gt;, writing in November’s issue of &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist: &lt;/em&gt;you are more than your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245066&quot;&gt;Does time management work? A meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2021/04/14/organization-of-cell-assemblies-in-the-hippocampus.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Organization of Cell Assemblies in the Hippocampus&quot; and will briefly
presnt how this subject can be approached with topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A
fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in
information processing. According to the &quot;cell assembly&quot; hypothesis,
transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons
underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal
cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be
arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common
modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of
hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using
the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the
animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial
prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase
modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted
from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30,ms, suggesting
that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this
temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal
neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time
window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity
at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage
in cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/649110286/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This past month marked an anniversary like no other. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and with it, normal life of eating out, commuting to work, and seeing grandparents came to a sudden halt. One year later, my new book about the intersection of psychology and the workplace was published. With wide-scale vaccinations on the rise, I thought it would be a good time to take stock of where we are and just how much has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, major shifts in how employees think about and interact with their workplace were well underway. Routine tasks were increasingly handed over to automation, such that workers could concentrate on more complex or valuable activities. Employees were being shuffled into new environments guided by activity-based working, with neighborhoods and open-plan floor plans replacing traditional cubicles. Gig working was on the rise and self-employed side hustles were becoming the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 added fuel to the fire. During the pandemic’s peak, approximately 30% of employees were working from home, while internet use surged by up to 30% of pre-pandemic levels, as workers competed for bandwidth with their kids who were now thrown into distance learning. Social collaboration tools, like Zoom and Teams, found the footing that they were searching for and quickly became the default means of working with peers and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though employers made swift and effective adjustments, the pandemic unearthed social inequalities that were bubbling under the surface. Whereas over half of information workers in the US (e.g. consultants or managers) had the luxury to stay safe by working from home, only 1 in 20 service workers could do the same. These workers were tied to their physical workplace, making cars, cooking food, or cleaning hospitals, and often represented people of color. They bore the brunt of the sudden lockdown in normal life, having to both put themselves at risk and be left without the tools to work in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sustainable progress towards an end to the pandemic in sight, employers have already made decisions that will have lasting effects on the workplace. Remote working has proven both feasible and effective for even the most skeptical companies, resulting in many employers encouraging hybrid working. Exactly what this means is still up in the air, even for Big Technology. Twitter and Spotify have vowed to make remote working indefinite, while Google requires employees who plan to spend more than 14 days at home annually to apply for special permission. Somewhere in between are Facebook, Salesforce, and Amazon who have all stated support for a hybrid model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offices that employees are returning to will also look and feel different. This past year has given employers the rare opportunity to reassess their real estate portfolio. For example, companies like Target have recently announced a reduction of their office footprint, anticipating lower utilization due to hybrid working. When they do come in, workers will be there to collaborate with peers, access tools and technology, or simply meet up as a team. What is increasingly off the menu is the solitary, heads-down type of work that was typically done in a cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, much of the shift to the Future of Work has been unidimensional, by tackling the physical workplace. What lags behind is a new set of behaviors and social norms that will help guide employees about how and when they should interact with their new workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, video conferencing breaks down the separation between home and work life. Catching a glimpse of a curious four-year-old popping up on screen or spotting laundry that has yet to be put away creates unintended and possibly inappropriate intimacy. Whereas, choices about when to turn on the camera and what hours are truly off-limits have yet to fully work themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the tangible office, effective remote working will be made possible by a range of behaviors and social norms that interplay with the motivations, needs, and desires of employees. Wearing a suit while on camera not only looks odd, but plays against our desire for being comfortable at home. There is a competing interest between looking professional and feeling comfortable, with the answer resting somewhere between formalwear and pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter this new Future of Work, the same psychological tendencies that have always governed our work behavior will undergo a period of adjustment. Drivers like identity, reward, and obedience are all still in play, but will take on a distinct flavor as we migrate to a new way of working. Building rapport on Zoom is different than sitting down for a meal, just like observing job performance in person benefits from a degree of constant visibility that will go missing with remote work. Following the pandemic, there is little doubt that the workplace will fundamentally change; the question is how and when the psychology of workers will catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Read a free chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190061241.001.0001/oso-9780190061241-chapter-2?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social%20media&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oupac-campaign%3A1359185357522304002&quot;&gt;“Connection” from&lt;em&gt; Punching the Clock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, freely available until 13 May 2021.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/piranka?mediatype=photography&quot;&gt;piranka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/649110286/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/649110286/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/649110286/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/the-coming-refugee-crisis-how-covid-19-exacerbates-forced-displacement/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The coming refugee crisis: how COVID-19 exacerbates forced displacement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/corona-and-the-crown-monarchy-religion-and-disease-from-victoria-to-elizabeth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Corona and the crown: monarchy, religion, and disease from Victoria to Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Who Identify With Humanity As A Whole Are More Likely To Say They’d Follow Pandemic Guidelines And Help Others</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/14/people-who-identify-with-humanity-as-a-whole-are-more-likely-to-say-theyd-follow-pandemic-guidelines-and-help-others/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ever-changing public health measures rolled out during the coronavirus pandemic haven’t always been crystal clear. But several instructions have remained the same throughout: wear a mask, wash your hands, and stay two metres apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the strength and frequency of this messaging, however, the public hasn’t always complied. Though the exact reason for this non-compliance is clearly complex, researchers from the University of Washington have proposed one factor that could influence people’s behaviour: the extent to which they identify with other human beings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248234&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they suggest that a connection with and moral commitment to other humans may be linked to greater willingness to follow COVID-related guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41801&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 2537 adults from across the world, based in countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia. First, they were asked how likely they were to comply with the health behaviours recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) at the start of 2020, when the pandemic begun to spread across the world. The four key behaviours the WHO recommended were thoroughly washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, social distancing, and not touching the face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were then asked how likely they were to engage in four prosocial behaviours: donating masks to a hospital, picking up someone with COVID-19 from the side of the road, going grocery shopping for a family that needed food despite stay-at-home guidelines, and calling an ambulance for someone afflicted with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then indicated how strict their country or area’s lockdown was at the time, how available tests were in their area, and how much they perceived themselves at personal risk of contracting the virus. They also reported how much they identified with their own community and their own nation, and finally how much they identified with all humanity (e.g. responding to statements like “how much do you believe in being loyal to all humanity?”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who identified more strongly with all of humanity were significantly more likely to say they’d engage both in prosocial behaviours, such as donating masks and going grocery shopping for others, and in the WHO health behaviours designed to stop the spread of the virus. Other factors also had an impact on prosocial behaviours — identification with one’s community was strongly linked with several outcomes, for instance. But identification with all of humanity was the only variable that significantly predicted &lt;em&gt;all five&lt;/em&gt; outcomes, and had a much larger effect than any of the other variables.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are positive news for those who reject nationalism — participants who identified more closely both with their own community &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; humanity as a whole were more likely to engage in prosocial and health behaviours than those who strongly identified with their nation alone. As the team puts it, the strongest prosocial behaviour is seen in those who feel connected to “the larger family of humanity” than to a specific nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how, exactly, does identification with humanity develop? Further research could look at the genesis of such ideas, as well as looking at a wider demographic sample (72% of this sample were university educated, for example). Ascertaining whether certain personality types or traits are linked to such beliefs could also be illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear how far these findings go in explaining not just non-compliance but outright &lt;em&gt;rejection&lt;/em&gt; of guidelines. Finding out what makes anti-lockdown groups tick may also be necessary when it comes to increasing uptake of public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248234&quot;&gt;Identifying with all humanity predicts cooperative health behaviors and helpful responding during COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Operational Response to US Measles Outbreaks, 2017-19</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/04/13/operational-response-to-us-measles-outbreaks-2017-19/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/measles-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread coverage with a highly efficacious vaccine, pockets of under vaccinated populations and imported cases can result in sizable measles outbreaks. And even though measles was declared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/elimination.html&quot;&gt;eliminated in the United States&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 years ago, the country has faced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html&quot;&gt;series of large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in the years since, particularly over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10652-9&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, we conducted interviews with individuals from state and local health departments and health systems from across the country who responded to measles outbreaks in 2017-19, representing outbreaks that account for more than 75% of all US measles cases over that period. Our principal aim was to capture firsthand operational experiences in order to generate evidence-based lessons that can inform preparedness activities for future outbreaks of measles and other highly transmissible diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study took place under the umbrella of a larger initiative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/about-1/#mission&quot;&gt;Outbreak Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to address the operational challenges and barriers faced during outbreak responses and disseminate lessons to facilitate future preparedness and response efforts. Outbreak responses tend to be busy times that do not lend themselves to documenting operational knowledge acquired during the response. Outbreak Observatory aims to provide a forum to aggregate those lessons so that other jurisdictions can put them into practice without having to learn them firsthand. Previous Outbreak Observatory studies—including on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305139&quot;&gt;2017-18 US hepatitis A epidemic&lt;/a&gt; and the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/preparedness-and-response-to-an-emerging-health-threatlessons-learned-from-candida-auris-outbreaks-in-the-united-states/8A4AD3D3F0C26821C652723765985BFB&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2753&quot;&gt;2017-18 influenza season&lt;/a&gt; on US health systems—identified lessons that reach beyond those individual responses to inform broader outbreak and epidemic preparedness. As highlighted by the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic response, it is critical to share the wealth of operational experience held by frontline responders to improve outbreak response readiness and capacity in advance of future communicable disease events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants in our study on US measles outbreaks called attention to a number of resource and operational gaps during their response operations that apply directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these outbreaks were quite large, none even remotely compared to the scale of the US COVID-19 epidemic. Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing. These gaps became front-page news with COVID-19, as health departments around the country struggled to implement effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/health/coronavirus-testing-labs-workers.html&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03518-4&quot;&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02478-z&quot;&gt;other surveillance operations&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Additionally, most health departments interviewed in this study indicated that they did not have the resources available to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/02/biden-promises-enough-covid-19-vaccines-all-americans-end-of-may/&quot;&gt;mass vaccination operations&lt;/a&gt; in response to the outbreak. Rather, they relied heavily on healthcare providers and pharmacists in the community to administer the vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have observed during the COVID-19 response—first with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/03/etruenorth-tiny-company-running-covid-19-company/&quot;&gt;mass testing clinics&lt;/a&gt; and currently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2102535&quot;&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;—health departments need considerable external resources to stand up large-scale responses for major epidemics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tfah.org/report-details/publichealthfunding2020/&quot;&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily&lt;/a&gt; over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the outbreaks included in this study, many of which occurred largely in insular communities—eg, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, orthodox religious communities—COVID-19 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html&quot;&gt;disproportionately impacted vulnerable racial and ethnic minority communities&lt;/a&gt;. Public health and healthcare organizations faced significant barriers to encouraging vaccination among the affected communities, and we are currently observing similar challenges as the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines scales up and eligibility groups expand. During the measles outbreaks, health officials often relied on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmj4.com/news/coronavirus/most-trusted-voices-are-local-doctors-clergy-wh-press-secretary-psaki-talks-vaccine-hesitancy-and-access-in-tmj4-exclusive&quot;&gt;community healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those that serve vulnerable and insular communities, to engage with the affected community. Additionally, trusted community leaders—including religious leaders, business owners, and community-based organizations—played a critical role as trusted voices to disseminate accurate information regarding protective measures, including vaccination. It requires substantial time and resources to develop these relationships, however, and it can be very difficult to do so in the midst of an outbreak or epidemic response. Health departments that had previously established relationships (e.g., from previous outbreaks) found it easier to leverage these community leaders to make a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the disease epidemiology or clinical care or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1201971218345466&quot;&gt;disease epidemiology or clinical care&lt;/a&gt; or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly. It is critical to understand the operational experiences of frontline responders, including public health and healthcare organizations, and to translate those experiences into evidence-based lessons that can inform other preparedness efforts. Without these lessons, the jurisdictions repeat the same mistakes and must learn those lessons firsthand. And the challenges, barriers, and shortcomings identified during smaller outbreaks will only be exacerbated during larger events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to document and disseminate these operational experiences, like Outbreak Observatory and others, support the development of programs and policies that can enable sustainable public health preparedness capacity that is needed for a range of communicable disease events, from smaller outbreaks to larger health emergencies like COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bits of DNA: The amoral nonsense of Orchid’s embryo selection</title>
	<link>https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about Clubhouse yet… well, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolis/2021/01/26/the-latest-silicon-valley-unicorn-clubhouse-raises-100-million-and-also-raises-attention-to-the-importance-of-audio-based-social-networking/?sh=581771e823a6&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the latest Silicon Valley unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; popular new chat hole for thought leaders. I heard about it for the first time a few months ago, and was kindly offered an invitation (Club house is invitation only!) so I could explore what it is all about. Clubhouse is an app for audio based social networking, and the content is, as far as I can tell, a mixed bag. I’ve listened to a handful of conversations hosted on the app.. topics include everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/everyone-wants-invite-clubhouse-crypto&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/01/26/forget-about-san-francisco-and-silicon-valley-miami-is-planning-on-being-the-next-great-tech-hub/?sh=7aceb2ea466e&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. It was interesting, at times, to hear the thoughts and opinions of some of the discussants. On the other hand, there is a lot of superficial rambling on Clubhouse as well. During a conversation about genetics I heard someone posit that biology has a lot to learn from the fashion industry. This was delivered in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZBKX-6Gz6A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you are hearing something profound&lt;/a&gt;” manner, by someone who clearly knew nothing about either biology or the fashion industry, which is really too bad, because the fashion industry is quite interesting and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if biology has something to learn from it. Unfortunately, I never learned what that is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the regulars on Clubhouse is &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Noor Siddiqui&lt;/a&gt;. You may not have heard of her; in fact she is officially “not notable”. That is to say, she used to have a Wikipedia page but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Noor_Siddiqui&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deleted on the grounds that there is nothing about her that indicates notability&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course notable in and of itself… a paradox that says more about Wikipedia’s gatekeeping than Siddiqui (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russell 1903&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1380003729445896194?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Litt 2021&lt;/a&gt;). In any case, Siddiqui was recently part of a Clubhouse conversation on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.joinclubhouse.com/event/PD4qybXo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;convergence of genomics and reproductive technology&lt;/a&gt;” together with Carlos Bustamante (advisor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/luna-dna-will-give-bitcoins-genomic-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency based Luna DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cdbustamante/status/1380991720431742978?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soon to be professor of business technology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Miami) and Balaji Srinivasan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;). As it happens, Siddiqui is the CEO of a startup called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health&lt;/a&gt;“, in the genomics and reproductive technology “space”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The company promises&lt;/a&gt; to harness “population genetics, statistical modeling, reproductive technologies, and the latest advances in genomic science” to “give parents the option to lower a future child’s genetic risk by creating embryos through in IVF and implanting embryos in the order that can reduce disease risk.” This “product” will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Bustamante and Srinivasan are early “&lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/announcing-orchid&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operators and investors&lt;/a&gt;” in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid is not Siddiqui’s first startup. While she doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, she does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where she boasts of having (briefly) been a Thiel fellow and, together with her sister, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtimes.com/articles/14126/20140827/google-glass-has-a-place-in-the-medical-industry-with-a-new-app.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting a company&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager. The idea of the (briefly in existence) startup was apparently to help the now commercially defunct &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/google-glass-smart-glasses-what-happened-explained/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; gain acceptance by bringing the device to the medical industry. According to Siddiqui, Orchid is also not her first dive into statistical modeling or genomics. She notes on her website that she did “AI and genomics research”, specifically on “deep learning for genomics”. Such training and experience could have been put to good use but…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygenic risk scores and polygenic embryo selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health claims that it will “safely and naturally, protect your baby from diseases that run in your family” (the slogan “have healthy babies” is prominently displayed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt;). The way it will do this is to utilize “&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/orchid-blooms-with-4-5m-seed-for-preconception-test-to-determine-genetic-risks/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;” to screen embryos created through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/embryo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;“. What this means in (a statistical geneticist’s) layman’s terms is that &lt;strong&gt;Orchid is planning to use polygenic risk scores derived from genome-wide association studies to perform polygenic embryo selection for complex diseases&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be easily unpacked because it’s quite a simple proposition, although it’s far from a trivial one- the statistical genetics involved is deep and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;single-gene disorder&lt;/a&gt; is a health problem that is caused by a single mutation in the genome. Examples of such disorders include Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia, Huntington’s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and many other diseases. A “complex disease”, also called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifactorial_diseases&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multifactorial disease&lt;/a&gt;, is a disease that has a genetic component, but one that involves multiple genes, i.e. it is&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;not a single-gene disorder. Crucially, complex diseases may involve effects of environmental factors, whose role in causing disease may depend on the genetic composition of an individual. The list of diseases on Orchid’s website, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease are all examples of complex (multifactorial) diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify genes that &lt;em&gt;associate &lt;/em&gt;with a complex disease, researchers perform &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genome-wide association studies&lt;/a&gt; (GWAS). In such studies, researchers typically analyze several million genomic sites in a large numbers of individuals with and without a disease (used to be thousands of individuals, nowadays hundreds of thousands or millions) and perform regressions to assess the marginal effect at each locus. I italicized the word associate above, because genome-wide association studies do not, in and of themselves, point to genomic loci that cause disease. Rather, they produce, as output, lists of genomic loci that have varying degrees of association with the disease or trait of interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polygenic risk scores&lt;/a&gt; (PRS), which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/broadinstitute/status/1354804918264098817?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Broad Institute claims to have discovered&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: they were not discovered at the Broad Institute), are a way to combine the multiple genetic loci associated with a complex disease from a GWAS. Specifically, a PRS &lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{S}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; for a complex disease is given by&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{S} = \sum_{j=1}^m X_j \hat{\beta}_j,&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Em+X_j+%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D_j%2C&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of a PRS is straightforward, but the details are complicated, in some cases subtle, and generally non-trivial. There is debate over how many genomic loci should be used in computing a polygenic risk score given that the vast majority of marginal effects are very close to zero (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/28/R2/R143/5555564&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Janssens 2019&lt;/a&gt;), lots of ongoing research about how to set the weights to account for issues such as bias caused by&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; linkage disequilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22050&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shin et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22245&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newcombe et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09718-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ge et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12653-0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lloyd-Jones et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pattee and Pan 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), and continuing discussions about the ethics of using polygenic risk scores in the clinic (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00829-7&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lewis and Green 2021&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much of the discussion around PRS applications centers on applications such as determining diagnostic testing frequency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2019&lt;/a&gt;),  polygenic embryo selection (PES) posits that polygenic risk scores should be taken a step further and evaluated for embryos to be used as a basis for discarding, or selecting, specific embryos for in vitro fertilization implantation. The idea has been widely criticized and critiqued (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31210-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419312103%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karavani et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). It has been described as unethical, morally repugnant, and concerns about its use for eugenics have been voiced by many. Underlying these criticisms is the fact that the technical issues with PES using PRS are manifold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor penetrance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;penetrance&lt;/a&gt;” for a disease refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genetic variant that have the disease. Many single-gene disorders have very high penetrance. For example, F508del mutation in the CFTR gene is 100% penetrant for cystic fibrosis. That is, 100% of people who are homozygous for this variant, meaning that both copies of their DNA have a deletion of the phenylalanine amino acid in position 508 of their CFTR gene, will have cystic fibrosis. The vast majority of variants associated with complex diseases have very low penetrance. For example, in schizophrenia, the penetrance of “high risk” &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; copy number variants (in which there are variable copies of DNA at a genomic loci) was found to be between 2% and 7.4% (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/17/3477/677022&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vassos et al 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The low penetrance at large numbers of variants for complex diseases was precisely the rationale for developing polygenic risk scores in the first place, the idea being that while individual variants yield small effects, perhaps in (linear) combination they can have more predictive power. While it is true that combining variants does yield more predictive power for complex diseases, unfortunately the accuracy is, in absolute terms, very low. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason for low predictive power of PRS is explained well in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and is illustrated for coronary artery disease (CAD) in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073510972035155X?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rotter and Lin 2020&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14722&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14722&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;rotterandlin&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1698,1302&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/rotterandlin/&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue is that while the polygenic risk score distribution may indeed be shifted for individuals with a disease, and while this shift may be statistically significant resulting in large odds ratios, i.e. much higher &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; risk for individuals with higher PRS, the proportion of individuals in the tail of the distributions who will or won’t develop the disease will greatly affect the predictive power of the PRS. For example, Wald and Old note that PRS for CAD from (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khera et al. 2018&lt;/a&gt;) will confer a detection rate of only 15% with a false positive rate of 5%. At a 3% false positive rate the detection rate would be only 10%. This is visible in the figure above, where it is clear that control of the false positive right (i.e. thresholding at the extreme right-hand side with high PRS score) will filter out many (most) affected individuals. The same issue is raised in the excellent review on PES of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01019-3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lázaro-Muńoz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The authors explain that “even if a PRS in the top decile for schizophrenia conferred a nearly fivefold increased risk for a given embryo, this would still yield a &amp;gt;95% chance of not developing the disorder.” It is worth noting in this context, that diseases like schizophrenia are not even well defined phenotypically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120305047?casa_token=gKO_3q8Fr5gAAAAA:cvtDCj7tY2Pj6ZFcpLS3KgGN0MnnNlxcgU5rsL0P-DhIOdYQD6wIU2GBAWFuT6Ou51njyLqs_A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mølstrøm et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which is another complex matter that is too involved to go into detail here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent tweet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Siddiqui describes natural conception as a genetic lottery&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Orchid Health, by performing PES, can tilt the odds in customers’ favor. To do so the false positive rate must be low, or else too many embryos will be discarded. But a 15% sensitivity is highly problematic considering the risks inherent with IVF in the first place (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g252&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kamphuis et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be concrete, an odds ratio of 2.8 for cerebral palsy needs to be balanced against the fact that in the Khera et al. study, only 8% of individuals had an odds ratio &amp;gt;3.0 for CAD. Other diseases are even worse, in this sense, than CAD. In atrial fibrillation (one of the diseases on Orchid Health’s list), only 9.3% of the individuals in the top 0.44% of the atrial fibrillation PRS actually had atrial fibrillation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315686&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Choi et al 2019&lt;/a&gt;).As one starts to think carefully about the practical aspects and tradeoffs in performing PES, other issues, resulting from the low penetrance of complex disease variants, come into play as well. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370478v2.full&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lencz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;) examine these tradeoffs in detail, and conclude that “the differential performance of PES across selection strategies and risk reduction metrics may be difficult to communicate to couples seeking assisted reproductive technologies… These difficulties are expected to exacerbate the already profound ethical issues raised by PES… which include stigmatization, autonomy (including “choice overload”, and equity. In addition, the ever-present specter of eugenics may be especially salient in the context of the LRP (lowest-risk prioritization) strategy.” They go on to “call for urgent deliberations amongst key stakeholders (including researchers, clinicians, and patients) to address governance of PES and for the development of policy statements by professional societies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predicaments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation I had with &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F2LPg4AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicolas Bray&lt;/a&gt; several years ago shortly after the exciting discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing, on the implications of the technology for improving human health. Nick pointed out that the development of genomics had been curiously “backwards”. Thirty years ago, when human genome sequencing was beginning in earnest, the hope was that with the sequence at hand we would be able to start figuring out the function of genes, and even individual base pairs in the genome. At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/1992/genome-1209&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the human genome project was billed as&lt;/a&gt; being able to “help scientists search for genes associated with human disease” and it was imagined that “greater understanding of the genetic errors that cause disease should pave the way for new strategies in diagnosis, therapy, and disease prevention.” Instead, what happened is that genome editing technology has arrived well before we have any idea of what the vast majority of the genome does, let alone the implications of edits to it. Similarly, while the coupling of IVF and genome sequencing makes it possible to select embryos based on genetic variants today, the reality is that we have no idea how the genome functions, or what the vast majority of genes or variants actually do.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14725&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14725&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;1_5Fr1LgIxEpYNApdOCu98cA&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;500,224&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca/&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=500&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that is known about the genome is that it is chock full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/a&gt;. This is statistical genetics jargon for the fact that variation at a single locus in the genome can affect many traits simultaneously. Whereas one might think naïvely that there are distinct genes affecting individual traits, in reality the genome is a complex web of interactions among its constituent parts, leading to extensive pleiotropy. In some cases pleiotropy can be &lt;em&gt;antagonistic&lt;/em&gt;, which means that a genomic variant may simultaneously be harmful and beneficial. A famous example of this is the mutation to the beta globin gene that confers malaria resistance to heterozygotes (individuals with just one of their DNA copies carrying the mutation) and sickle cell anemia to homozygotes (individuals with both copies of their DNA carrying the mutation). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of complex diseases we don’t really know enough, or anything, about the genome to be able to truly assess pleiotropy risks (or benefits). But there are some worries already. For example, HLA Class II genes are associated with Type I and non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/105/3/e245/5715056&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jacobi et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;), Parkinson’s disease (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurology.com/articles/shared-human-leukocyte-antigen-hla-coverage-in-dementia-and-parkinsons-disease.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James and Georgopolous 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which also describes an association with dementia) and Alzheimer’s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12017-020-08612-4&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wang and Xing 2020&lt;/a&gt;). PES that results in selection against the variants associated with these diseases could very well lead to population susceptibility to infectious disease. Having said that, it is worth repeating that we don’t really know if the danger is serious, because we don’t have any idea what the vast majority of the genome does, nor the nature of antagonistic pleiotropy present in it. Almost certainly by selecting for one trait according to PRS, embryos will also be selected for a host of other unknown traits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, what can be said is that while Orchid Health is trying to convince potential customers to not “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roll the dice&lt;/a&gt;“, by ignoring the complexities of pleiotropy and its implications for embryo selection, what the company is actually doing is in fact&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;rolling the dice for its customers (for a fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health’s selling points&lt;/a&gt; is that unlike other tests that “look at 2% of only one partner’s genome…Orchid sequences 100% of both partner’s genomes” resulting in “6 billion data points”. This refers to the “couples report”, which is a companion product of sorts to the polygenic embryo screening. The couples report is assembled by using the sequenced genomes of parents to simulate the genomes of potential babies, each of which is evaluated for PRS’ to provide a range of (PRS based) disease predictions for the couples potential children. Sequencing a whole genome is a lot more expensive that just assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel. That may be one reason that most direct-to-consumer genetics is based on polymorphism panels rather than sequencing. There is another: the vast majority of variation in the genome occurs at a known polymorphic sites (there are a few million out of the approximately 3 billion base pairs in the genome), and to the extent that a variant might associate with a disease, it is likely that a neighboring common variant, which will be inherited together with the causal one, can serve as a proxy. There are rare variants that have been shown to associate with disease, but whether or not they explain can explain a large fraction of (genetic) disease burden is still an open question (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young 2019&lt;/a&gt;). So what has Siddiqui, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;touts the benefits of whole-genome sequencing in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that others such as 23andme have missed? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is value to whole-genome sequencing for polygenic risk score analysis, but it is when one is performing the genome-wide association studies on which the PRS are based. The reason is a bit subtle, and has to do with differences in genetics between populations. Specifically, as explained in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0610-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;De La Vega and Bustamante, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), variants that associate with a disease in one population may be different than variants that associate with the disease in another population, and whole-genome sequencing across populations can help to mitigate biases that result when restricting to SNP panels. Unfortunately, as De La Vega and Bustamante note, whole-genome sequencing for GWAS “would increase costs by orders of magnitude”. In any case, the value of whole-genome sequencing for PRS lies mainly in identifying relevant variants, not in assessing risk in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of population structure affecting PRS unfortunately transcends considerations about whole-genome sequencing. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/psychgenetics/Fulltext/2018/10000/Polygenic_risk_score_for_schizophrenia_is_more.2.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Curtis 2018&lt;/a&gt;) shows that PRS for schizophrenia is more strongly associated with ancestry than with the disease. Specifically, he shows that “The PRS for schizophrenia varied significantly between ancestral groups and was much higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between these groups was 10 times as high as the mean difference between European schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African and European subjects hardly overlapped.” The figure from Curtis’ paper showing the distribution of PRS for schizophrenia across populations is displayed below (the three letter codes at the bottom are abbreviations for different population groups; CEU stands for Northern Europeans from Utah and is the lowest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of PRS on population is a problem that is compounded by a general problem with GWAS, namely that Europeans and individuals of European descent have been significantly oversampled in GWAS. Furthermore, even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of PRS can depend on confounding factors such as socio-economic status (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/48376&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mostafavi et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). Practically speaking, the implications for PES are beyond troubling. The PRS scores in the reports customers of Orchid Health may be inaccurate or meaningless due to not only the genetic background or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;admixture&lt;/a&gt; of the parents involved, but also other unaccounted for factors. Embryo selection on the basis of such data becomes worse than just throwing dice, it can potentially lead to unintended consequences in the genomes of the selected embryos. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0379-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;) show unequivocally that clinical use of polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People pathos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are jumping aboard a technically incoherent venture and are willing to set aside serious ethical and moral concerns is not very surprising. See, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-response-to-wsj-doubts-about-new-technology-2015-10&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by its investors despite concerns being raised about the technical foundations of the company. After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical story &lt;/a&gt;appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the company put out a statement that &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Bad stories]…come along when you threaten to change things, seeded by entrenched interests that will do anything to prevent change, but in the end nothing will deter us from making our tests the best and of the highest integrity for the people we serve, and continuing to fight for transformative change in health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;did bother a few investors at the time&lt;/a&gt;, many stayed the course for a while longer. Siddiqui uses similar language, brushing off criticism by complaining about paternalism in the health care industry and gatekeeping, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stating that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an age of seismic change in biotech – the ability to sequence genomes, the ability to edit genomes, and now the unprecedented ability to impact the health of a future child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her investors, many of whom got rich from cryptocurrency trading or bitcoin, cheer her on. One of her investors is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;, who believes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Orchid is] a step towards where we need to go in medicine.&lt;/a&gt;” I think I can understand some of the ego and money incentives of Silicon Valley that drive such sentiment. But one thing that disappoints me is that scientists I personally held in high regard, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/jan-liphardt&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jan Liphardt&lt;/a&gt; (associate professor of Bioengineering at Stanford) who is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/careers#scientists&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientific advisory board&lt;/a&gt; and Carlos Bustamante (co-author of the paper about population structure associated biases in PRS mentioned above) who is an investor in Orchid Health, have associated themselves with the company. It’s also very disturbing that Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of 23andme whose team of statistical geneticists understand the subtleties of PRS, still went ahead and invested in the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health’s polygenic embryo selection, which it will be offering later this year, is unethical and morally repugnant. My suggestion is to think twice before &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10JnJomtaCrGi0HE8r2EnwGvPzE4vJWAMHUR0HMXQcIg/viewform?edit_requested=true&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sending them three years of tax returns&lt;/a&gt; to try to get a discount on their product.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re Worse At Remembering Exactly What We’ve Given To Friends Than What We’ve Given To Strangers</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/12/were-worse-at-remembering-exactly-what-weve-given-to-friends-than-what-weve-given-to-strangers/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s say a friend asks you to help them to move house. When deciding how much time you can offer, you might consider how much you’ve helped that particular friend lately (and perhaps how much they’ve helped you). But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19656-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests that if that friend is particularly close, you’re likely to have a poorer memory of just how much time you’ve dedicated to helping them. You might offer more help than you would to an acquaintance not just because this friend is closer, but because your brain’s distinction between a close friend and yourself is blurrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41780&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that the closer we are to someone, the less clear is the distinction between our mental representations of our own self and their self is supported by various &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/08/close-friends-become-absorbed-into-our-self-concept-affecting-our-ability-to-distinguish-their-faces-from-our-own/&quot;&gt;earlier studies, including some that we’ve covered.&lt;/a&gt; In the new work, Pinar Uğurlar at the University of Cologne, Germany and colleagues asked three separate groups of participants to divvy up a series of theoretical resources (pizzas, for example, and bitcoin) between themselves and another person, then later recall just how much of each they’d given away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the theoretical recipient was the person that the participants had identified as being “closest” to them. These participants had also completed something called the Independent Self-Construal Scale. This asks for levels of endorsement of statements such as “I am a unique person separate from others”. The results showed that those with a more distinct self-representation had better recall of how much pizza, and so on, they had chosen to give away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In follow-up studies, the team looked for any differences in recall when people were asked to allocate resources to the person closest to them or to someone they had only met once. The researchers found that when people were interacting (in this hypothetical scenario) with a close friend, their recall was significantly poorer than when they were interacting with someone they barely knew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical nature of the studies is certainly a limitation. Also, the team did not directly investigate perceived levels of self/other overlap or the effect of this on memory. Still, the work does suggest that closeness “can indeed impair people’s memory of their own decisions”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There could be a social upside to this, however. Giving away resources (whether that’s time or food, say, or materials) to benefit others carries an immediate cost to an individual. Blurred distinctions between the self and close others could make it easier for a person to make that selfless decision, and so benefit their group — which in the longer term, benefits them. As the team suggests, “not fully separating the self from others on a purely cognitive level may help groups resolved social dilemmas.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19656-001&quot;&gt;Interpersonal closeness impairs decision memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might have heard of the “Mozart effect”, the idea that playing babies classical music can boost their intelligence. &lt;/strong&gt;But is there any truth to that claim? In a word, no — but check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p09cz6j6/can-listening-to-classical-music-really-boost-intelligence-&quot;&gt;nice video from Claudia Hammond&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Reel&lt;/em&gt; to learn more about where the myth came from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41769&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies have found that both male and female observers — including healthcare professionals — underestimate the amount of pain that women are experiencing&lt;/strong&gt;. We may overestimate men’s pain as well, and there’s some evidence that these gender biases even extend to beliefs about children’s pain. But more work is needed to understand perceptions of pain beyond the standard pool of White, western participants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/womens-pain-is-routinely-underestimated-and-gender-stereotypes-are-to-blame-new-research-158599&quot;&gt;writes Amanda C de C Williams&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a common belief that you can spot a liar by the way they act. &lt;/strong&gt;But research suggests this isn’t really the case: we are no good at deciding whether someone is lying based on their nonverbal behaviour. And while psychologists have found that there are other, better ways of probing the truth of a suspect’s story — such as specific interview techniques — many police forces and border security officials still rely on the old, ineffective methods, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210401-how-to-tell-when-someone-is-lying&quot;&gt;writes Jessica Seigel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Psychological Science Accelerator could offer a new model for conducting psychology research, potentially helping the field to get past its replication crisis. &lt;/strong&gt;The group has already launched several large, international, pre-registered studies, both replications and new work. But is the model sustainable? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22360363/replication-crisis-psychological-science-accelerator&quot;&gt;Brian Resnick takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to think we should fix something by adding more stuff to it.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s according to series of studies in which participants were presented with various scenarios like improving a travel itinerary or essay: most people tended to add destinations or words, rather than removing them. But the work also suggests that prompts and opportunities for practice can make people more likely to find “subtractive” solutions instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/the-takeaway-is-that-we-dont-tend-to-take-things-away/&quot;&gt;writes John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A US panel has concluded that the use of brain organoids in research is ethical&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/studies-make-brainlike-structures-or-add-human-cells-animal-brains-are-ethical-now&quot;&gt;reports Jocelyn Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The committee, set up by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, found that it is “extremely unlikely” that in the near future brain organoids will be conscious, and that there is no need for any new form of oversight for work using these “mini-brains”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does growing up in poverty affect brain development? &lt;/strong&gt;A number of studies have found that children from an impoverished background show certain differences in brain structure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/03/the-psychological-impacts-of-poverty-digested/&quot;&gt;as we wrote in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But this data is largely correlational — so now, researchers are looking at how reducing poverty by providing regular cash payments actually affects cognition and brain development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/upshot/stimulus-children-poverty-brain.html&quot;&gt;reports Alla Katsnelson&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Dealing with measles outbreaks in areas of high anti-vaccination sentiment</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/04/09/dealing-with-measles-outbreaks-in-areas-of-high-anti-vaccination-sentiment/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing the spread of infectious diseases has taken on heightened significance over the last year, as COVID-19 swept the world. Terms like ‘contact tracing’ and ‘vaccine trials’ have become hot discussion topics for the general population, not just those who work in public health or medical research. But the research I want to share here was research conducted before coronavirus was even ‘a thing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, we set out to uncover what the top priorities are when dealing with a &lt;em&gt;measles&lt;/em&gt; outbreak, particularly in a region where there might be lower than average vaccination rates. We conducted a multi-round survey (an interactive method known as a Delphi survey) with a range of Australian health professionals who are responsible for managing and responding to a disease outbreak: public health officials, infectious disease experts, immunization program staff, and others involved in delivering vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to find out what they see as the priority issues when trying to contain an outbreak. We asked our participants to imagine a measles outbreak in a hypothetical region known for its low levels of childhood vaccination coverage. We asked them what practical issues and challenges they would face, and what they would need from non-vaccinating members of the community to effectively manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study we undertook is part of a broader project called UPCaV for short – ‘Understanding, Parenting, Communities and Vaccination’. This project has been examining vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Australia from a range of different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier phase of the project involved in-depth interviews with Australian parents who refuse some or all vaccines for their children. Some of the findings from that phase have been published by Wiley et al (2020). Parents reported feeling stigmatized, bullied, disrespected and misunderstood. Notably, not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”, a label that has become increasingly used in media reporting and one that tends to close down conversation rather than open it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that stood out the most for me from our Delphi survey, was that trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy. Trying to change the minds of vaccine-refusers was not considered a priority during an outbreak, nor was offering vaccination. Participants’ first priority was to contact potentially infected people and isolate vulnerable members of the community in order to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I found compelling in our findings, were the responses to a question about what strategies are most successful for countering mistrust among non-vaccinating parents during an outbreak. Recurring responses to this question were the need for patience and calm education. Panellists suggested it was important to highlight to parents the serious complications that can arise from measles. And they suggested that it is important not to get into arguments with non-vaccinating members of the community, but instead to offer reassurance, provide accurate information and to acknowledge different beliefs. These comments were exciting to see because they align so well with previous research I’ve been involved with, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkingaboutimmunisation.org.au/&quot;&gt;Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation&lt;/a&gt; (SKAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two quotes from participants struck a chord with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Reassurance, patience, education may help with those people that are still ‘sitting on the fence’ about vaccination.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Recognizing and acknowledging people’s beliefs, however conveying facts and not getting drawn into a discussion or arguments.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these participants were talking about an imagined measles outbreak, their perspectives have significance for how we respond to other disease threats and how we communicate effectively with diverse populations. As I write this (April 2021), the COVID-19 vaccines have begun to be rolled out in Australia. While the questions in our survey were about measles, the implications for how best to manage the threat of disease, while also communicating in an open, thoughtful and compassionate way, especially with people who might be feeling nervous about vaccinations, is timely.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We Have A Strong Urge To Find Out What Might Have Been — Even When This Leads To Feelings Of Regret</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/08/we-have-a-strong-urge-to-find-out-what-might-have-been-even-when-this-leads-to-feelings-of-regret/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AGreenburgh&quot;&gt;Anna Greenburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regret seems to be a fundamental part of the human experience. As James Baldwin wrote, “Though we would like to live without regrets, and sometimes proudly insist that we have none, this is not really possible, if only because we are mortal.” Expressions of regret are easy to find throughout the history of thought, and, as indicated in the Old Testament, intrinsic to regret is a sense of emotional pain: “God regretted making humans on earth; God’s heart was saddened”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the aversive experience of regret, traditional models of decision-making predict that people should to try to avoid it. But of course, the picture is more complex — we all have experienced the desire to know &lt;em&gt;what might have been, &lt;/em&gt;even if it leads to regret&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620963615&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led by Lily FitzGibbon at the University of Reading, finds that the lure of finding out what might have been is surprisingly enticing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41760&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across six experiments, the researchers employed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in which participants are required to inflate a computer animation of a balloon. The more they inflate the balloon, the greater the participant’s payoff — but each balloon has a randomly assigned “safe limit” above which it pops, and the participant is paid nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In each trial, participants decided how many times to pump up the balloon and were then shown the trial outcome: whether the balloon popped (“bust” trials), or remained inflated thereby giving participants a reward (“bank” trials). After this outcome was revealed, they had the opportunity to seek “counterfactual” information — that is, feedback about alternative possible outcomes; in this case, how far they could have pumped the balloon safely in the trial and how much they could have won. Importantly, as the balloons’ safe limits varied randomly across trials, this information could not help performance later on in the task. Participants were asked to rate their emotional state, from sad to happy, after learning the outcome of the trial, and indicate whether this emotional state had changed after receiving the counterfactual information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how often participants sought counterfactual information, as well as its emotional effects. They focussed their analysis on “bank” trials as these trials were expected to clearly elicit regret: counterfactual information on these trials normally signified a missed opportunity as the participant could usually have inflated the balloon more and therefore earned a higher reward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all experiments, participants seemed to experience regret in “bank” trials: they felt significantly worse after receiving counterfactual information. Unsurprisingly, the greater the missed opportunity, the worse the participants felt. But even though this information elicited regret, counterfactual curiosity was high: participants requested feedback in 46% of “bank” trials across all the main experiments, and 71% in a replication study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, participants even spent money to receive counterfactual information: although counterfactual curiosity was higher when information was free, when they had to pay for it, they still requested feedback on 18% of bank trials. Similarly, in experiments where participants needed to exert physical effort to obtain counterfactual information, they requested feedback around half the time. This underlines how difficult it is to resist the motivational pull of learning about missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The counterfactual curiosity observed in “bank” trials also had detrimental effects on participants’ performance. After receiving such feedback, participants took greater risks on subsequent trials, which had a negative effect on the number of points won, particularly when this behavioural adjustment was large. This highlights a mechanism likely relevant to gambling problems: counterfactual curiosity can exacerbate damaging gambling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many regrets in life pertain to our own mistakes made in isolation, as social beings we continually fret over interactions with others. Of course, the BART is an abstract paradigm so the study cannot speak to regrets of a more social nature. While this is a question for future research, the strength of counterfactual curiosity exposed in the paper might suggest that many of us have a morbid curiosity to seek out regret in all forms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: When People Hold Morally-Based Attitudes, Two-Sided Messages Can Encourage Them To Consider Opposing Viewpoints</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/07/when-people-hold-morally-based-attitudes-two-sided-messages-can-encourage-them-to-consider-opposing-viewpoints/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where do you stand on pheasant shooting? Or single-religion schools? Or abortion? However you feel, your attitudes probably have a strong moral basis. This makes them especially resistant to change. And since anyone who holds an opposing view, based on their own moral stance, is unlikely to be easily swayed by your arguments, these kinds of disputes tend to lead to blow-outs within families and workplaces, as well, of course, as online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, anything that can encourage people to be more open to at least thinking about an alternative point of view could be helpful, reasoned Mengran Xu and Richard E. Petty at The Ohio State University, US. And in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220988371&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, they reveal a potentially promising method for doing just this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41750&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first pair of studies, the researchers looked at how various messages about gun control and freedom of speech for Nazis went down with a total of 375 US-based participants. The participants first reported on their attitudes to these topics, and the extent to which those attitudes had a moral basis. Then, those who felt that Nazis should &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;be allowed to speak in US high schools read a statement that concluded with the argument that, in fact, they should be allowed to. There were two variations, however: this conclusion was preceded either with strong arguments in its favour (a one-sided message), or with these arguments plus an acknowledgement that some people might find this “too much” for high school students (a two-sided message). A similar procedure was used with those who’d initially reported support for gun control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants used a simple scale to indicate how open they were to reconsidering their position. The researchers’ analysis revealed that as the moral basis of a participant’s attitudes increased, their openness to the opposing view decreased. However, for those who’d read the two-sided message, this effect disappeared: that is, morally-based attitudes no longer seemed to make people less open to opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study found that when a two-sided argument did not really respect the opposing argument, in that it offered only weak counter-arguments — such as claiming that gun ownership is bad because guns make upsetting loud noises — this was no more effective at influencing the participants than single-sided messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study attempted to get closer to examining people’s actual behaviour. The participants in this study had all reported being unsupportive of the idea that masks should always be worn outside during the Covid-19 pandemic. The team found that a two-sided message had a bigger impact than a one-sided message on the participants’ reported openness towards more mask-wearing, and on their reported intention to wear masks more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With respect to the findings overall, the researchers write, “the relative benefit of a two-sided message over a one-sided communication is enhanced as the attitude’s moral basis increases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conflict and misunderstanding between people with different views does seem to have grown worse in recent decades, they add. This work suggests that one way to tackle this — and to advance your or your organisation’s point of view on a topic with a strong moral underpinning — is to clearly respect the reasons for an alternative viewpoint at the same time as advocating your own position. This is hardly a radical argument. But given the often vitriolic debates that develop around morally based attitudes, it’s surely worth bearing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220988371&quot;&gt;Two-Sided Messages Promote Openness for Morally Based Attitudes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Bullying Between “Frenemies” Is Surprisingly Common</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/06/bullying-between-frenemies-is-surprisingly-common/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that bullying can be one way of climbing the social ladder for teenagers. Research published in 2019, for instance, found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/&quot;&gt;teenagers who combine aggressive behaviour with prosociality see the most social success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But who, exactly, are teenagers bullying? According to Robert Faris from the University of California, Davis and colleagues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712972&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Sociology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might not be who you’d expect. Rather than bullying those more distant from them, the team finds, teens often pick on their own friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41740&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data came from a longitudinal study of middle and high school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 (years 7, 8, and 9 in the UK). The team looked specifically at aggression, creating “networks” that reflected who had been aggressive towards whom at the schools. These were based on peer-nominations by the students, who had named up to five schoolmates who had “done something mean” to them in the past three months, as well as five &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; had been mean to. This didn’t include friendly teasing, focusing instead on acts of genuine aggression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also indicated who their five closest friends were. As with aggression, a matrix was created to understand mutual and unrequited friendships, as well as linking friends of friends and measuring whether friendships were sustained or dissolved over the course of the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at several adverse outcomes of being bullied — anxiety, depression, and lack of attachment to school, based on self-reports from the kids. The aggression matrix and friendship matrix were then cross-referenced in order to ascertain whether students were being victimised by friends, friends of friends, or by more distant schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that bullying was more likely to occur within friendships, and between friends of friends, compared to between kids with more distant social ties. This could partly be down to aggression between &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; friends: aggression was three times more likely to arise within friendships that dissolved during the school year. But it might also indicate a “frenemy” relationship, wherein both friendship and aggression coincide — aggression was four times more likely to occur in friendships that sustained themselves through the study than in more distant relationships (though it’s important to note the difference in rates of aggression between former friends and “frenemies” is not significant). Unsurprisingly, the team also found evidence that being bullied is associated with significant increases in depression and anxiety and decreases in attachment to school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is clear from the results is that victimisation is a common experience for teenagers — and that it can be friends and friends of friends who perpetrate this aggression, whether those ties are mutual or not. While individual traits or social and familial circumstances are key to understanding why teens bully others, the results also suggest that the complex social dynamics of schools can play a significant part too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be a chance to rethink anti-bullying programmes, the team suggests: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/&quot;&gt;as previous research has shown&lt;/a&gt;, aggression can have a positive social outcome for bullies, helping them climb the social ladder. Thinking more carefully about how to strengthen existing friendships and highlight their rewards may be one way of reducing the social value accrued through aggression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712972&quot;&gt;With Friends Like These: Aggression from Amity and Equivalence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We Have Many More Than Five Senses — Here’s How To Make The Most Of Them</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/01/we-have-many-more-than-five-senses-heres-how-to-make-the-most-of-them/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with the phrase “healthy body, healthy mind”. But this doesn’t just refer to physical fitness and muscle strength: for a healthy mind, we need healthy senses, too. Fortunately, there’s now a wealth of evidence that we can train our many senses, to improve not only how we use our bodies, but how we think and behave, as well as how we feel. Trapped as we are in our own “perceptual bubbles”, it can be hard to appreciate not only that other people sense things differently — but that so can we, if we only put in a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if we’re going to make the most of using and improving our senses to enhance our wellbeing, we have to consider more than sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. Aristotle’s desperately outdated five sense model may still be popular, but it vastly under-estimates our extraordinary human capacity for sensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41716&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proprioception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proprioception — the sensing of the location of our body parts in space  —  has been relatively ignored, but it’s critical for confidence in using our bodies. If you now shut your eyes, and extend a leg, it’s thanks to this sense that you know exactly where your leg is. To go for a run, then, or work out in the gym, and not fall or injure yourself, you need a good sense of proprioception. Our sedentary lifestyles are a threat to this sense (and the Covid-19 lockdowns certainly did not help). But climbing trees, walking along balance beams, navigating obstacles, crossing stepping stones (which you can simulate at home, using small mats placed on the floor) are all proprioceptively demanding, and so train this sense. According to research led by a team at the University at North Florida, these kinds of exercises not only improve physical coordination &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26029969/&quot;&gt;but also working memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yoko Ichino, the ballet mistress at Northern Ballet, based in Leeds, teaches regular proprioception classes, during which students are required to practise complex moves with their eyes shut. “We use our eyes too much,” Ichino says. “We need to use all our other senses as well but because our eyes are open all the time, we never develop them. So I put that into my own training.” She recommends (if it is safe) to move around your home with your eyes closed. This will train not only proprioception but another suite of senses:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vestibular senses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vestibular system allows us to sense the direction of gravity (and so which way is up), as well as horizontal and vertical movement (as in a car or a lift) and in three dimensions (as on a rollercoaster). Research shows that a healthy vestibular system is important not only for balance but for our sense of being grounded inside a physical body; in fact, people with vestibular problems are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669509/&quot;&gt;more likely to report out-of-body experiences&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also more likely to get lost, because a healthy vestibular system is important for a good sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For all of us, though, the older we get, the duller all our vestibular responses become. (This becomes noticeable at a population level &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046616/&quot;&gt;from the not very grand old age of 40&lt;/a&gt;). Specific vestibular rehab training exercises have been developed for people diagnosed with definite vestibular problems. But the rest of us will benefit from dynamic movements that require moving the head, like those involved in climbing a tree or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vestibular.org/sites/default/files/page_files/Improving%20Balance%20With%20Tai%20Chi_2.pdf&quot;&gt;practising tai chi&lt;/a&gt;, as well as anything that challenges our balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light-detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that our eyes are not just for seeing. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848671/&quot;&gt;melanopsin-expressing cells in the retina&lt;/a&gt; are exposed to light, they send signals to the master body-clock, in the brain’s hypothalamus (without causing us to see a thing). Certain variations in the gene for this protein have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647333/&quot;&gt;linked to an increased risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and stimulating these receptors in the morning with suitable levels of light &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5299389/&quot;&gt;helps to ward off low mood.&lt;/a&gt; To improve psychological wellbeing, you don’t need to train these receptors to work better, but you do need to help them to work for you by getting outdoors in the morning and avoiding bright light in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smell is not hugely regarded, or developed, in many people in Western cultures. But research with hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Jahai, who live in the tropical rainforest in Malaysia, shows that we have the biological capacity to smell extraordinarily well. Asifa Majid, now at the University of York, and colleagues, found, for example, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0139&quot;&gt;Jahai took on average only two seconds to precisely describe an odour, while Dutch-speakers took an average of 13 seconds&lt;/a&gt; to arrive at a much poorer description (describing the scent of a lemon simply as “lemony”, say, rather than using more abstract descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To develop your sense of smell, Majid and others advocate consciously smelling different things, often. Professional perfumer Nadjib Achaibou, who is based in London, tells me that his sensitive nose is absolutely trained, not born. The best way to enhance your sense of smell is to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, and explore it, he argues: “You might say, ‘Oh, I like pepper.’ &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;? Why do I like it? What is it adding to your dish? That’s the first step to enhance your sense of smell. If you see a rose, stop and smell it. If you have a friend wearing perfume, smell the perfume and describe it. When you buy a shower gel, a toilet detergent or a perfume, ask questions. Read the marketing materials, but also trust yourself. You might think, yes they say there is rose in that but what I can smell is lemon. But what &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of lemon?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put in the effort to enhance your sense of smell, and you should enjoy all kinds of other benefits. Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000281&quot;&gt;a fishy smell improves our critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while a 2018 study in Germany found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/&quot;&gt;people who are more sensitive to smells enjoyed sex more&lt;/a&gt;, and women with a better sense of smell reported more orgasms. “The perception of body odours such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience,” by increasing sexual arousal, they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have receptors in our skin that register temperatures within specific ranges. Stimulation of our “warmth-sensors”, in particular, has been linked to feeling less lonely, and also “warmer” towards other people. Some of the most-publicised results in this field have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;failed to replicate&lt;/a&gt;, leading critics to question them. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-79280-001&quot;&gt;2019 study &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggested that results might have been mixed because researchers weren’t taking into account the ambient temperature outside, or inside the lab. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/&quot;&gt;When they did this in their research&lt;/a&gt; — which involved strapping heated backwraps to participants and asking them about their social plans — the team found support for the idea that feeling cold physically is associated with feeling “colder” socially, driving a desire for more contact with other people. Providing heat (via the backwrap, in this case) could eliminate this effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner sensing (interoception)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 10% of us are really good at sensing our own heartbeat without feeling for a pulse, 5-10% of us are terrible at it, and the rest fall in between. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X17300106&quot;&gt;Research shows &lt;/a&gt;that people who are better at so-called “cardiac interoception” experience emotions more intensely, enjoy more nuanced emotions, and are better at recognising other people’s emotions, which is a critical first step in empathy. In contrast, people who don’t experience emotions in the typical way (a condition called “alexithymia”, which is thought to affect up to 10% of people, to some extent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.150664&quot;&gt;suffer from impairments in inner sensing&lt;/a&gt;. Could training inner sensing help, then, to improve our emotional wellbeing? It’s still early days for this research, but work led by Sarah Garfinkel, now at University College London, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079488/&quot;&gt;suggests that it can&lt;/a&gt;. This is a training technique that you could try at home:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit somewhere quiet and set a timer (on your phone or home digital assistant, perhaps) for one minute, but don’t start it yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now start the timer, and try to count your heart beats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do this again, but feel for your pulse this time, to take an accurate measure (this is the feedback that should help your interoceptive awareness to improve).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat all the steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t sense your heart beating, try exercising first, because this makes it easier.&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/170863&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;influential paper&lt;/a&gt; by David E. Bell considered the implications of disappointment, a psychological reaction caused by comparing an actual outcome to a more optimistic expected outcome, as in playing the lottery. Equations for regret, disappointment, elation, and satisfaction have been incorporated into economic models of financial decision-making (e.g., variants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prospect theory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial choices comprise one critical aspect of decision-making in our daily lives. There are so many choices we make every day, from the proverbial option paralysis in the cereal aisle... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGEKveX93g/YGTYpK9T9jI/AAAAAAAANSM/L1KICAqlN0kap457Oyy3-dLrGpMv746rQCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/cereal%2Baisle.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGEKveX93g/YGTYpK9T9jI/AAAAAAAANSM/L1KICAqlN0kap457Oyy3-dLrGpMv746rQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/cereal%2Baisle.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;...to decisions about who to date, where to go on vacation, whether one should take a new  job, change fields, start a business, move to a new city, get  married, get divorced, have children (or not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who to trust.

Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm out of my element here, so this will limit my understanding of these models.

And by &quot;overinterpreting&quot; I mean claiming  results from a binary probabilistic decision-making task have  implications for individualized cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1371242065837748227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My motivation for writing this post was annoyance. And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper in &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was far more measured and sophisticated, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In probabilistic decision making, people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;often without being aware of it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unaware shall become aware. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Further advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagne et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/s856/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;381&quot; data-original-width=&quot;856&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h178/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17586866&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885654&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; (including in the authors' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730669&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own work&lt;/a&gt;). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ &lt;i&gt;but see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fried (2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) ]&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions. My snappish response to the press release concerns whether we can prescribe individualized therapies based on the differences between the yellow arrows on the left (“resilient people”) compared to the right (“internalizing people” — i.e., the anxious and depressed), given that the participants may not even realize they're learning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s709/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;709&quot; data-original-width=&quot;697&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w394-h400/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will leave it to Dr. Eiko Fried (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;) to explain whether we should accept (or reject) this bifactor model of “shared symptoms” vs. “unshared symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell DE.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Companies’ Succession Announcements Can Inadvertently Make Work Life Harder For Incoming Female CEOs</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/31/companies-succession-announcements-can-inadvertently-make-work-life-harder-for-incoming-female-ceos/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an organisation appoints a new male CEO, the announcement will typically highlight his past achievements and the competencies that make him ideal for the job. What if the new CEO is a woman? The widely expected, gender-neutral thing to do is, of course, to make precisely the same type of announcement. However, according to the team behind a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19394-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, this can make work life more difficult for her, and shorten the time that she spends in that role. Priyanka Dwiwedi at Texas A&amp;amp;M University and her colleagues base this striking conclusion on an extensive analysis of data on women who have been appointed to top positions in the US, as well as in-depth interviews with female executives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41702&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might an announcement that focuses on the winning candidate’s past successes and competences affect a female vs a male leader differently? Perhaps, the team theorised, it might showcase “that the new female leader does not adhere to prescriptive norms about how women ‘should be’. Such violations could elicit social disapproval, backlash and evaluation penalties for women.” In other words, new female leaders who are praised for their competence, confidence and ambition (stereotypically “male”-type leadership traits) may then experience “stereotype threat” — and feel judged for not conforming to the stereotypically female profile of being nurturing, socially sensitive and group-focused. The psychological burden of this could then make it harder for the woman to remain in her job. Lab-based work has supported these ideas, and there has been some anecdotal evidence in its favour, too. But this is the first attempt at major, real-world investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To start with, the team considered 91 female CEO successions among companies included in major US stock market indices between 1995 and 2012. When a host of other factors that could plausibly have influenced any CEO’s longevity were taken into account, the researchers noted a link between endorsements that focused on success and competence and a shorter time as CEO. (These endorsements came from the companies’ own websites, press releases and annual reports, for example.) Two factors did emerge as being linked to a longer time in the job despite success-focused endorsements, however: the female CEO being an internal rather than an external appointment, and the presence of a relatively high number of female executives in the company. Analysis of a matched sample of male CEOs did not reveal a link between endorsement content and time in the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran semi-structured interviews with 31 female executives (not all CEOs, though all in senior management positions), each with an average of 25 years’ experience at a variety of US companies. The findings from this qualitative portion of the study supported the team’s idea that such women are subject to stereotype threat. They found that “female executives were chronically aware of gender stereotyping and continued biases in the male-dominated context of upper echelons both during their transition into, and throughout their time in, their executive roles.” These women also reported all kinds of negative personal responses, including anxiety about being perceived as incompetent, or having insufficient legitimacy as a leader, as well as feeling exhausted with dealing with the stereotypes. For example, one commented: “When a woman is demanding, they think she’s a bitch… But if a man is demanding, they see him as tough and good.” Another talked about how, as she moved up the ranks, she felt much more hostility and exclusion — so much so, that she eventually quit her job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview-based segment of the study supports the idea that women in top leadership roles suffer from unhelpful stereotypes about women. When it comes to the team’s main conclusion, however — that the content of the endorsement of a new female CEO can affect her longevity in the job — it’s important to note that the link is correlational. (Though the team’s failure to find such an association for the male CEOs is certainly worth stressing.) Though the researchers did control for a lot of other potential influences on their results, this study could not definitively demonstrate that the content of the appointee endorsement in and of itself &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; greater or lesser stereotype-related pressures on a female CEO. But if their suggestion that it does is correct, what are the practical lessons?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It does pose a dilemma for companies, the researchers accept. “While they would do well to support their new female leaders in as many ways as they can, they also need to constantly recognise that any such support could backfire because of implicit gender biases and stereotyping”. The team did find that the presence of more female executives mitigated this, though. So: “Perhaps the only long-term solution to this dilemma is for organisations to obtain a critical mass of female leaders in order to buffer them against potentially negative stakeholder perceptions.” They add that though this study focused on women, it’s likely that CEOs from other minorities in the executive level in businesses will experience something very similar. The finding also contributes to the growing body of work finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;well-intentioned attempts to counteract gender stereotypes can backfire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19394-001&quot;&gt;“Burnt by the spotlight”: How leadership endorsements impact the longevity of female leaders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The relationship between self-harm and bullying among adolescents</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/03/31/the-relationship-between-self-harm-and-bullying-among-adolescents/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/person-2244036_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is often the result of a complex interplay of genetic- biological, psychological and environmental factors. Bullying is one aspect that can increase the risk of self-harm. However not all adolescents who experience bullying harm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullies are also at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only being the victim of bullying that is related to self-harm, but also being a bully aggressor. In fact, in our study we found that adolescents who are both bullies and are bullied by their peers (the bully-victims), were the group most vulnerable to self-harm. They were six times more likely to self-harm than adolescents who weren’t bullies or bullied&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the “bully-victims” have the broadest range of adjustment problems, presenting difficulties common to both bullies and victims. An earlier study found that many of the bully-victims first have a history of being bullied, and then begin to bully peers later in adolescence. Thus, they suffer from both emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there a relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bullying victimization and self-harm are associated with emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. In our study we found that emotional problems and parental conflicts were important factors for the association between the bullied adolescents and self-harm, and between the bully-victims and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that school behavioral problems also accounted for some of the relationship between self-harm and the bullies, and self-harm and bully-victims. This confirms the idea that the act of bullying is part of a broader concept of conduct behavioral problems with aggressive and delinquent behaviors, school failure, and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental support and school well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;School well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullies and the bully-victims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we see that those who are bullied and/or bullies may be more likely to engage in self-harm, we know that not everyone who is bullied or bullies self-harms. We therefore investigated what might protect against self-harm amongst the bullies, bullied and bully-victims. We found that although parental support had a protective effect on self-harm among boys and girls in general, it was especially important for those who are bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the willingness to talk to and seek help from parents during a difficult time like bullying, may protect against self-harm among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to also find that school well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullied and the bully-victims. Our result appears to be the first to investigate the buffering effect of school well-being on bullying behavior and self-harm among adolescents. This is an important result for the prevention of self-harm. Schools, parents, and health care professionals should be aware of the importance of school well-being for adolescents who are being bullied, in terms of identifying those at risk of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequent is self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that fifteen percent of participating adolescents reported engaging in self-harm during the last year. This is consistent with earlier studies finding the 12-month prevalence rate to be between 10 to 19% around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348041/&quot;&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we used in this study was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ungdata.no/english/&quot;&gt;Ungdata&lt;/a&gt;” that is a cross-sectional, large, national survey, designed for adolescents. A total of 14 093 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, from different parts of Norway, participated in the study; this was 87% of those invited to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data was collected at one point in time and therefore we do not know if the bullying occurred prior to self-harm. However, previous longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856713001834&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that bullying increased the risk of self-harm and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we measured self-harm and bulling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured self-harm by asking if the adolescents had tried to harm them self in the past 12 months. Bullied was measured by asking adolescent if they had been teased, threatened, or frozen out by other young people in school, free time, online, or on their mobile phones. Bullying other peers was measured by asking if they had taken part in teasing, threatening or freezing out out other young people at school, free time, online or by mobile phone. We created a new variable to measure those both being bullied and who bully others (the bully-victims), by combining the variables “Bullied” and “Bullying other peers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong link between bullying and self-harm. Interventions to address bullying may reduce self-harm. Our findings also suggest that high levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm. Addressing these factors may be important in reducing the risk of self-harm among those experiencing bullying.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Supporting community needs with an enhanced code policy on PLOS Computational Biology</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/IQFg2gChmhg/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has adopted an enhanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;code sharing policy&lt;/a&gt; for all papers submitted from 30 March 2021. The change, announced in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, comes in response to community needs and support for initiatives which drive Open Science practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Community drivers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code sharing is not new to many of our authors. Research shows that 41% of papers in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; already share code voluntarily (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;Boudreau &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating the community’s willingness to make their work both rapidly available and methodologically transparent. This creates a strong foundation for implementing a stronger policy and also works towards establishing code sharing as a normal research behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; defines “open” as more than the availability of a research article. Our authors, editors, and readers see data and code sharing as tools to boost reproducibility and transparency. Sharing code alongside data will allow others to check and reproduce work and ultimately drive new discoveries. Requiring authors to share their code (unless there are good reasons not to) works towards making the research published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; as robust as possible for the benefit of the whole research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt; we sought views from researchers in the computational community on the barriers they face when sharing code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;Harney &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2021&lt;/a&gt;). We then tested our policy text with researchers to help inform its design and content. This has allowed us to respond to researcher needs, for example by allowing exemptions to the policy for those with legitimate legal or ethical constraints on sharing. In this way, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; continues to be shaped by policies the community has helped define, and Open Science values that reflect the way they want to communicate research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Open Science at PLOS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Science is one of our founding principles at PLOS. Enhancing the code sharing policy at one of our journals in response to community needs is just one step we are making to increase the adoption of Open Science practices. We aim to empower researchers to share their good practices because we believe communities are best placed to define their own needs. The computational biology community is shaping the future of research communication by leading the way in practices that make science more open and equitable for all. However, we do offer guidance and help to those who need it, for example, by detailing best practice for code sharing alongside our policy text. No matter how researchers choose to make their work Open, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; provides options to support researcher needs and the platform to influence broader change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaboration with the community and responding to their needs is part of our approach to Open Science, regardless of how that community is defined. We will be closely monitoring the reaction to the code sharing policy at &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; and exploring what an enhanced policy could mean for other communities that we serve. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>xcorr.net: Building Neuromatch Academy</title>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2021/03/25/building-neuromatch-academy/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content&quot;&gt;Neuromatch Academy 2020&lt;/a&gt; is a three-week online summer school in computational neuroscience that took place in July of 2020. We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience – from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973&quot;&gt;we have a preprint out&lt;/a&gt;, and NMA has been covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email&quot;&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I’m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/&quot;&gt;Richard Gao wrote a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little background: my stint into teaching&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here’s my explanation of globals in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type… If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it’s a module variable. That’s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. […many rambling minutes later…]. In any case, don’t use globals if you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn’t fit with novice students’ current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner’s motivations – both intrinsic and extrinsic – and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically – at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Code in Place&lt;/a&gt;. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford – &lt;a href=&quot;https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html&quot;&gt;including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel&lt;/a&gt; – given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level – understanding what they’re stuck on, where they’re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording’s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team – Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  – working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn’t know I was ready for. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/&quot;&gt;if you’re wondering whether industry is right for you&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it’s a great place to get that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Deciding what to build&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you’re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism&quot;&gt;Heilmeier questions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much will it cost?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will it take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can answer these questions, you know what you’re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn’t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don’t foster belonging. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution risk and legal risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1500$ for each TA, and we’re aiming for 200 TAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re launching July 13th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier’s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee’s duties. The curriculum committee’s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running on enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We’re democratizing education! We’re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We’re doing something no one’s ever done! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer’s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer’s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you’re refusing to accept that gift, and that’s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step – you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There’s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done – update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in – we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://quire.io/&quot;&gt;quire&lt;/a&gt;, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It’s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running like clockwork&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen – when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emdupre&quot;&gt;Elizabeth DuPre&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference&quot;&gt;this talk by the creator of Elm&lt;/a&gt; – in open source projects, the right culture doesn’t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. “Deadlines matter” is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you’re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can’t do that at NMA – your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. – if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran – ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me “a little German” for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I’m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&quot;&gt;It’s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism&lt;/a&gt; – we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that’s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn’t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a “good enough” version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good tools to work productively with each other&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;, Fred Brooks claims that “adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later”. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle – a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it’s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wevideo.com/&quot;&gt;WeVideo&lt;/a&gt;) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good organization to work productively with each&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don’t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student’s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That’s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It’s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel – everybody is on the same side. It’s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/&quot;&gt;This kind of design thinking&lt;/a&gt; – ship early, ship often, iterate – can be applied to all aspects of open source education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Making decisions under uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you make decisions swiftly and effectively in a big org? We had hundreds of volunteers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/9fp4v/&quot;&gt;134 authors on the curriculum paper alone&lt;/a&gt;. 134 very smart people cannot all be of the same opinion at the same time in the face of uncertainty. The first step to make decisions effectively is to separate decision making and execution. It’s very easy to leave a lot of decisions to be implicit until it’s crunch time. It happened a couple of times that I made a medium-scale decision or encouraged other people to make medium-scale decisions during a daily standup meeting. Big mistake. A lot of people affected by the decisions weren’t in the room; they felt unheard and now burdened to go to a daily meeting to stay in the loop. Don’t do that – take bigger decisions in separate planning meetings. Every software methodology has some notion of a planning meeting, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;waterfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)&quot;&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; or whatever – by the end of that meeting you should be clear about what to do for the next week or month. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that can sap a lot of energy at these meetings is having circular arguments: revisiting the same question in subsequent meetings even though you thought you had come to an agreement. Sometimes, one person thinks a decision was made, while another thinks things were still under discussion. Write down decisions in meeting notes, share them with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some orgs in the for-profit sector are hierarchical, so that disagreements get resolved top-down. That doesn’t really work in the non-profit sector, where people are there on a volunteer basis. In non-profit and in open source communities, many orgs thus use consensus-based decision making. I think pure consensus-based decision making is very difficult to get right. I’m a member of a not-for-profit makerspace that’s built on anarchist principles. We use consensus-based decision-making, and it gets rowdy: flame wars on our message board are not infrequent, whether it’s about resource allocation and who gets the space when and whose responsibility it is to take the trash out. Pure consensus-based decision making can have an insidious effect that people that are not in agreement with the majority are left isolated as “difficult” and “not a team player”. That can breed resentment, which leads to personality clashes, which leads to dysfunction: decision making grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s an alternative to pure consensus-based decision making: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit&quot;&gt;disagree and commit&lt;/a&gt;. You replace the norm that consensus must be reached with an alternative norm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;everybody’s opinion should be understood &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;decisions are made based on majority or supermajority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s ok to disagree with a decision but we all bound ourselves to the decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sure that you understand somebody’s opinion – especially an opinion you don’t agree with –  you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/&quot;&gt;Steel Man technique&lt;/a&gt;. You restate the strongest version of their argument and engage with that. Oftentimes that will resolve whatever argument you had in the first place, or prepare you to build a hybrid solution. If you don’t come to a resolution, at least everyone will understand that they have been heard and understood. Decisions can take place in realtime in a synchronous meeting, or through a polling app in Slack (if a poll, put a deadline on it so it doesn’t drag on; in either case, quorum should be reached). If somebody disagreed with the decision, the norm says that that’s good and healthy, as long as they commit to the decision like everyone, so it doesn’t breed resentment in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Be the change you wish to see&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s law&lt;/a&gt; – but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students’ intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That’s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students’ emotional needs. That’s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads – I can be a difficult person and that’s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant’s email signature):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edwin Land&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: An interview with protocols.io: CEO Lenny Teytelman on partnering with PLOS</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/pgXjiPU_SWw/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our ongoing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io/&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; led to a new and exciting &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;article type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a new avenue to share research in-line with the principles of Open Science. This two-part article type gives authors the best of both platforms: protocols.io hosts the step-by-step methodology details while &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; publishes a companion article that contextualizes the study and orchestrates peer review of the material. The end result is transparent and reproducible research that can help accelerate scientific discovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read our interview with protocols.io CEO and co-founder Dr. Lenny Teytelman where he discusses what triggered the concept for the company, how researchers can benefit from this collaboration and how his team settled on such an adorable racoon logo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, what is protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It serves both researchers needing secure and private collaboration and those aiming to share their knowledge publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind protocols.io? Did you have any particular experiences or issues as a researcher that led to you believing protocol sharing was an under-supported element of the scientific community? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a year and a half of my postdoc that went into correcting just a single step of the microscopy methods that I was using. Instead of a microliter of a chemical, the step needed five, and instead of a fifteen-minute incubation with it, it needed an hour. The problem is that this isn’t a new technique but is a correction of a previously-published method. That means I didn’t get any credit for that year and a half, and everyone using this method was either getting misleading results or had to spend one or two years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering what I’d love to share with them, but didn’t have a good way of doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the experience that led to my obsession with creating a central place to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge, within research groups and companies and broadly with the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines had a need for a dedicated tool for proper method sharing… We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocols.io launched in 2014 — how were the first few years? How were you able to make yourself known and show that your product is worthwhile and secure for researchers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh, you just touched on a painful topic. I actually gave a talk at a conference in 2018, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJwKXZsmi4&quot;&gt;The harsh lessons from 4 years of community building at protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;. The first years were surprisingly rough. As an academic with zero entrepreneurial experience, I naively expected that once we build the platform, I’d tell my scientist friends that it exists, and through word of mouth, it would go viral. Turns out that it is not how new initiatives work. There is a lot of dedicated work needed to build the trust and visibility and simply let researchers know that you exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took the support of publishers, societies, funders, and Open Science and reproducibility champions to climb out of obscurity. Speaking of that support, the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between PLOS and protocols.io was critical in helping the research community learn about protocols.io.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the platform evolved since then? What elements have been consistent and what have been some major changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vision and mission have not really changed since 2014, but thanks to the constant feedback of the research community and a brilliant CTO and co-founder Alexei Stoliartchouk listening to that input, the product has grown from a rudimentary website to a powerful tool with amazing functionality to support the sharing of the method details and to help in the daily work of the researcher. For a fun comparison of where we were at launch in February 2014, take a look at our Kickstarter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1881346585/protocolsio-life-sciences-protocol-repository&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the early changes was in scope, a year after we launched. We initially thought that this is a platform for experimental wetlab scientists, but soon after launch, requests started to come to expand it to support computational/bioinformatics workflows. And then in 2017, there was another expansion in scope, catalyzed by that same 2017 partnership with PLOS. As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines needed a dedicated tool for proper method sharing. This actually led us to change our welcome page from “Repository for Life Science Methods” to “Repository for Research Methods.” We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is the new PLOS ONE Lab Protocol article type to the journey and mission of protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after our launch, when I realized that things don’t just “go viral”, I began to think a lot about incentives. It occurred to me some time in 2015 that it would be amazing if researchers had a way of turning their protocols into peer reviewed papers. I was looking at the &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; model and wondering if we could add peer review to protocols.io. The problem was that our scope was so broad, we would need thousands of academic editors to be able to support the peer review — essentially we’d have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. Then, in 2017 when we started working with PLOS, I realized, “We don’t have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;! It already exists; we just need to partner!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while this partnership is a big deal for protocols.io, I am particularly excited about it because of what it can do for reproducibility and Open Science. As I said when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-announces-two-new-peer-reviewed-article-types-for-plos-one/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with PLOS by launching this new modular article type. This will provide authors with all of the benefits of rigorous peer review, plus a dynamic and interactive platform to present their protocols, with support for videos and precise details that are important for adopting and building upon the published methods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, on the importance of Open Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS and protocols.io have similar mission statements and nearby offices: how did this collaboration with PLOS start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that our collaboration with PLOS is a consequence of me being co-advised as a graduate student by Professor Michael Eisen, co-founder of PLOS. That actually is not the case. It is true that as soon as I realized in 2012 that something like protocols.io needs to be built, I called Professor Eisen, described the idea, and said, “PLOS should build such a platform.” But he replied, “PLOS is a publisher, not a software developer. You need to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in fact, it is the Chief Science Officer of PLOS, Dr. Veronique Kiermer, who is the key early lead on the PLOS/protocols.io connection. Dr. Kiermer was the founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt; and has a passion for reproducibility and a deep appreciation for the essential role that protocols play in the research cycle. We met at an Open Access mixer in San Francisco when she had just moved to PLOS. As I showed her what we had built, she asked countless questions of “can it do this and that” and I showed her the “yes” answers right on my phone. She got excited and said, “This is exactly what I always dreamed of. We should do something together!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the COVID-19 pandemic taught you about the importance of Open Science and supporting collaborative research opportunities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stunned by the extent of rapid sharing and collaborative spirit in the research world, united against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is how you ideally imagine science working. It is how science should work. We’ve seen a remarkable level of rapid method sharing in the SARS-CoV-2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/coronavirus-method-development-community/publications?sort=views&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just the methods; researchers are sharing data, preprints, code in precisely the way that accelerates and amplifies everyone’s efforts around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am simultaneously inspired by what I see and frustrated that this isn’t yet the norm. I’ve been watching the world and publishers declare in 2015 that rapid sharing and immediate Open Access are essential for Ebola research. Then the same in 2016 for Zika. Then 2019 for all research related to the opioid crisis. In 2020 and 2021 it’s COVID-19. It’s frustrating that we make exceptions for pandemics and crises and then go back to the traditional stunted way of sharing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for protocols.io? (How can you continue to help scientists adopt Open Science activities?) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beautiful part of our growth (we have over 9,000 public protocols now and have been roughly doubling every year since our launch), is that with increased sharing and researchers on protocols.io we also have received more feedback and requests than ever. As more requests and suggestions come in, our appetite for improving and enhancing the platform only increases. It’s kind of like with research itself – each answer leads to more questions and more thirst for experiments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are also genuinely excited about the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Lab Protocols and we look forward to the first papers being published and to the future developments in this partnership. We’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus Question: How did you decide on the cute raccoon logo? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Disability, access, and the virtual conference</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After my first Zoom meeting of the pandemic, I found myself lying on the bathroom floor with my noise-cancelling headphones on, on the verge of a full-blown meltdown. As an autistic person, I’ve always been hypersensitive to noise and to visual stimuli—but I hadn’t realized that a Zoom meeting with my colleagues could cause sensory overload. The number of images on the computer screen, the amount of movement in those tiny thumb-nail images, and the speed with which the images had moved, flashed, and changed—not to mention the obtrusive noise of malfunctioning microphones and noisy, socially-distanced households—had been enough to make me physically sick. Although many people tend to assume that an online event is automatically more accessible than an in-person event (after all, people can attend without leaving their homes), this isn’t always the case. Even when online events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more accessible, one of the lessons the pandemic has reminded me of is that the act of creating disability access can fundamentally change the nature of the thing that is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing my new book, &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare and Disability Studies&lt;/em&gt;, I was interested in exploring disability access as art and in exploring disability access as a complicated (and complicating) multifaceted phenomenon. Disability access is rarely just a question of “Can someone with X impairment use Y?” but rather more often a question of “If we modify Y so that someone with X impairment can use it, how does it change the meaning, the experience, and the effect of Y?” Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible, whether the thing made accessible is a Shakespeare play (“the play’s the thing”) or a Zoom meeting. When we change the nature of the thing made accessible, we don’t just create access and inclusion for people with disabilities—we often create a new kind of experience altogether. I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities. Sometimes those new works, events, and objects bear a resemblance to the inaccessible version from which they grew. At other times, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most complex possibility, and the one most fundamentally counter-intuitive to a culture in which able-bodied and neurotypical (non-autistic) thinking are prioritized, is when creating accessibility not only fundamentally changes the nature of the thing made accessible but also causes attendees with a disability to lose something valuable. This seems counter-intuitive because stereotypical ways of thinking about disability have (falsely) taught us that disability experience does not include pleasure and that eliminating barriers to access is always an inherent and uncomplicated good. Neither of these things is true. For example, this year I’ll lead seminars at two Shakespeare conferences (the Shakespeare Association of America and the World Shakespeare Congress). Because of the pandemic, both conferences, for the first time ever, will be held completely online. However, these virtual events are more complicated for me than they originally seem, and their accessibility represents both gain and loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, both conferences will be more accessible for me in an online format. Traveling can be difficult for some autistic people (keeping in mind the effect of Zoom on my body and mind, imagine the effect of a crowded airport). I usually travel annually to the Shakespeare Association of America—but with much ado. I can’t fly alone (nor hope to navigate unfamiliar city streets or crowded hotels by myself) and so always travel with a support person. My support person is usually another Shakespearean, a kind volunteer who, after weathering the sensory travails of the airport and public transportation, will spend the conference with me. I am not independent. But also, I am never alone. Everything in my life is shared. There is a certain beauty in that. After a busy day of seminars and panels, I will lie on the hotel room bed in the fetal position, far too worn out from the crowds and the noise to do anything else, and my support person and I will gossip together with great pleasure about the intellectual goings-on of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disability, in our culture, is stereotyped as loss. Accessibility, in our culture, is deemed as always good, always a gain. It is also often misunderstood as simple and one-dimensional, as easy to understand and to explain. This year, for the first time ever, I will attend the Shakespeare Association of America without a support person. I will be independent. It is important, however, to think about the enormous cost of making the conference fully accessible to me. This act of access will fundamentally change the nature of what the conference is. The only way to make the conference fully accessible to me is for its social component, its travel component, its in-person component, to be completely removed. This represents a loss for all of the people at the conference and, ironically, also a loss for me. Because after my seminar at the 2021 Shakespeare Association of America, I won’t return to my hotel room to gossip about the intellectual goings-on of the conference with my support person. Rather, I will shut down my computer and reflect silently on the events of the conference… alone… for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Jon Tyson&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/&quot;&gt;Disability, access, and the virtual conference&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/647352848/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/647352848/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/647352848/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/taking-stock-of-the-future-of-work-mid-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Taking stock of the future of work, mid-pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/shape-today-and-tomorrow-qa-with-sophie-goldsworthy-and-julia-black-part-two/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SHAPE today and tomorrow: Q&amp;amp;A with Sophie Goldsworthy and Julia Black (part two)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Open Response to “Economic impact of UKRI open access policy” report</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SoB1zL-x4PY/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On February 17, 2021, FTI Consulting released the report: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FTI-Report-for-Publishers-Association-1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Economic assessment of the impact of the new Open Access policy developed by UK Research and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;” (full title) prepared for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publisher’s Association&lt;/a&gt; (PA) of the UK.  While we are not setting out to provide an extensive review and analysis of this report, we do want to generally refute the assertion that OA via the UKRI policy is economically damaging, and we’ll provide some references that support this position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Open Access and Open Research are an opportunity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FTI/PA report asserts that the impact of the new UKRI policy could lead to a loss in revenue to “UK-based journals” and have a broader negative impact on UK competitiveness, economic growth and position as a “global research hub.” This assessment appears to use impact on traditional publication models as the basis for this conclusion. A problem here, however, is that it is considering the scholarly publishing industry as somehow separate from the broader economic impact of making research open. Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/publications/publishings-contribution-to-research-and-innovation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;from the PA itself have shown that the link to the economy is much broader than this depiction. The UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap/uk-research-and-development-roadmap&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D roadmap&lt;/a&gt; clearly embraces open research and rapid open dissemination as not just good for science and health (especially during the current pandemic) but as a core part of “a world-leading system that unlocks innovation and growth throughout all parts of the economy.” Open Access enables this entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. When coupled with Open Research, it brings the additional benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913039116&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing trust in science&lt;/a&gt;, ever more important during these difficult times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Research (of which Open Access is one part) offers even greater opportunity both in terms of discovery and economic growth. For example, the European Data Portal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/the-economic-impact-of-open-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;on the economic impact of open data identifies the potential for 15.7% growth across a range of sectors – including scientific &amp;amp; technical, communication, transport, finance, health, retail and agriculture – and significant cost savings across the economy. We believe that a focus on Open Research, and all the efficiencies it brings, is worth considering for the UK economy especially in light of the combined impacts of the pandemic and Brexit (whatever one’s position on Brexit is).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Open Access is the fastest growing publishing model. A recent report from the scholarly analytics firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, shows that “in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/blog/open-access-surpasses-subscription-publication-globally-for-the-first-time/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2020 […]more outputs were published through Open Access channels than traditional subscription channels globally&lt;/a&gt;.” The report further show that the majority of the growth in OA is fueled by Gold OA, i.e. OA supported by some kind of business or sustainability model. It is ever more futile, in our opinion, to take such a critical and isolated position against UKRI policy when one can argue that OA is an outcome that will simply continue to happen. It is far more beneficial, as the policy itself proposes, to establish the UK as an early adopter, leader, and beneficiary of OA and its opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Publishers can and should lead&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of OA, the opportunities created by OA, and the desire for OA by the public and funders like UKRI, are clear. Contrary to Section 4.44 of the report, which mischaracterizes PLOS as publishing “at cost”, it is entirely possible to maintain value for authors, funders, and  institutions while operating a sustainable, surplus-generating business model. PLOS believes that publishers globally should be leading the efforts to devise and develop the next generation of business models that are able to support their operations in an Open Access context. This will, of course, require deep, and sometimes difficult, work by transitioning publishers. But we strongly believe this work is not outside the acceptable effort level of conscientious members of the scholarly publishing industry that have been aware of Open Access, and its benefits, for at least the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the UKRI for its efforts to hear from stakeholders in the scholarly  publishing community, and beyond, regarding the proposed policy. We understand it is a discussion rife with passionate viewpoints and unseen complexities, and so we would like to ensure that one point is clear: to successfully set up the most efficient,  frictionless Open Access ecosystem, we should leverage the &lt;em&gt;existing &lt;/em&gt;budgets and infrastructures of scholarly publishing but with OA as the outcome. This way, Open Access is not viewed as a destructive force, or something external and different that traditional publishers are not part of, but simply as the new way to publish and communicate research that all publishers can facilitate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Update: Name change policy</title>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/03/11/update-name-change-policy/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv now offers the following name change options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes&quot;&gt;Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)&lt;/a&gt;, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: World Kidney Day 2021: The Goal of Life Participation</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/WKD-2021-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 11 March 2021, &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating World Kidney Day. This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the &lt;em&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and the I&lt;em&gt;nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: A Farewell to ALM, but not to article-level metrics!</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bbDdYlM7-W8/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is &lt;a href=&quot;http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altmetric.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, the data displayed on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric’s media coverage&lt;/a&gt;. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;details page&lt;/a&gt;, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely. Unfortunately, our articles will no longer display PMC usage counts, as these were aggregated by ALM and will no longer be available. We will also be removing recent tweets from articles and retiring the ALM Reports service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving forward we will continue to evaluate the presentation of metrics on our articles and look for ways to integrate even more relevant data from Altmetric into our user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption can help determine where to target intervention resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Liverpool, Thompson and Pirmohamed, investigated the association between occupation and heavy alcohol consumption in working individuals aged 40-69 years in the UK. Thompson and Pirmohamed used the UK Biobank to recruit participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption, with jobs identified as skilled trades the most likely to be associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licensed premises, industrial cleaning process occupations, and plasterers. Whereas clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists and medical practitioners were least likely to be heavy drinkers. The authors findings help to determine which employment sectors may benefit most from health promotion programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights the need for prompt quality improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium (PAD) management are key elements in the care of critically ill patients. However, previous research has highlighted the gap between actual clinical practices and physicians’ attitudes to PAD management. Zhou &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated the current practice of PAD assessments in Chinese ICUs by a one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12308&quot; style=&quot;width: 341px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12308&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Capture2-300x143.png&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig. 5 taken from Zhou et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the actual PAD assessment rate was suboptimal, especially with regards to delirium screening. There was a significant gap between the actual practice and the physicians’ perception of the practice. Physicians reported performing assessing pain and agitation-sedation in approximately only 20 to 25% of patients which is lower than previous reports. Therefore, the study highlights the need for prompt quality improvement and the optimization of practices of PAD management in ICUs in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have sleep disturbance and this impacts their quality of life. However, it is not yet fully understood how sleep disturbance affects the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). Kuribayashi &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a prospective study on 20 patients to investigate the relationship between FD and sleep disturbance. Patients took sleep aids for 4 weeks and filled out questionnaires before and after taking sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids and as a result, GI symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with FD were also improved. In addition, the authors concluded that the use of sleep-inducing drugs was associated with reduced pain as well as improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in FD patients. Overall the study highlights the potential benefits of sleep aids for patients with FD and sleep disturbance, although multicenter studies involving a larger number of cases are needed to further investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12305 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/jogging-2343558_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;Previous research has reported that many muscles of the trunk and lower limb were greater in sprinters than in non-sprinters. However, the specific muscles that contribute to superior sprint performance for sprinters have not been fully identified. Suga &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;examined the relationships between the trunk and lower limb muscle cross-sectional areas and sprint performance in well-trained male sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that larger absolute and relative cross-sectional areas of the psoas major and gluteus maximus correlated with better personal best 100m sprint times. Therefore, the psoas major and gluteus maximus may be specific muscles for superior sprint performance for sprinters. The study also corroborates previous studies suggesting that the hamstring may not be an important muscle for achieving superior sprint performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#tab=tab_1&quot;&gt;Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women&lt;/a&gt; globally and cytology-based (Pap smear) screening is important for early detection and treatment. Although cervical cancer screening is beneficial and can enable early detection, a positive screening result might cause psychological burden. As a result, this may influence the decision to undergo further examination and future screening for cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaka &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a randomized control trial in Japan, with the intervention being the provision of cervical cancer information and cervical cancer screening information through a leaflet. The authors aim was to evaluate whether the leaflet would help reduce psychological distress. Women who were about to undergo cervical cancer screening received hypothetical screening results either with or without a leaflet, at random. Following the intervention, psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group than in the intervention group among those who received a hypothetical positive screening result. Therefore, the authors concluded that information provision might help reduce psychological distress and recommend that cervical cancer screening programs provide participants with all relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene &lt;em&gt;UBE3A&lt;/em&gt;, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are &lt;em&gt;covertly conscious&lt;/em&gt;—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true&quot;&gt;dreamless sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;amp;tag=1&quot;&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, it is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot;&gt;increased by psychedelic drugs&lt;/a&gt; that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1&quot;&gt;to test this hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above technique, called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf&quot;&gt;perturbational complexity index&lt;/a&gt; or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/&quot;&gt;Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645656224/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645656224/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/04/what-can-neuroscience-tell-us-about-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What can neuroscience tell us about the mind of a serial killer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/disability-access-and-the-virtual-conference/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Disability, access, and the virtual conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/addressing-health-inequity-in-disparities-of-cancer-outcomes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Addressing health inequity in disparities of cancer outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
&quot;microstates&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Announcing the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/T3NGu5QEYXA/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Author: Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce the creation of the PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;Scientific Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of active researchers with diverse perspectives to help us shape our efforts to promote Open Science, globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS, as a non-profit organization committed to empowering researchers to change research communication, cannot successfully pursue its mission without listening to the research community. We regularly survey and consult the research communities we work with, formally and informally, to guide our choices and developments. The organization’s governance, including our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/board-of-directors/&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, has always involved active researchers. And we derive great insight and advice from our continuous exchange with the academic Editors of PLOS journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to take an additional formal step and create a forum where the researchers who contribute to PLOS through different channels can interact directly with each other, and to ensure that this forum includes voices from researchers around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve created the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council, a small group of researchers who represent varied scientific and career perspectives, who will advise PLOS executive and editorial leadership on strategic questions of scientific interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Scientific Advisory Council is deliberately small–about a dozen individuals–to ensure in-depth discussions and engagement, but we’ve strived to include different disciplinary interests, career stages and geographic representation. The group includes four PLOS Board members who are themselves active researchers, two of our journals’ academic Editors-in-Chief, alongside researchers who are not formally associated with PLOS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to welcome the following members to the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council. To see their photos and full bios, please visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;page &lt;/a&gt;on our website: &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Alcohol Policies, Firearm Policies, and Suicide in the United States</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/03/01/alcohol-policies-firearm-policies-and-suicide-in-the-united-states/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/usa-1120579_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and firearms are a dangerous combination and are commonly involved in suicide in the United States. This has only increased in importance as a public health issue as alcohol drinking, firearm sales, and suicides in the United States have all increased since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. State alcohol policies and state firearm policies might impact alcohol and firearm related suicide, but it is unknown how these policies specifically relate to these suicides, or how these policies might interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess relationships between alcohol policies, firearm policies, and U.S. suicides in 2015 involving alcohol, firearms, or both. We used the Alcohol Policy Scale, previously created and validated by our team, to assess alcohol policies and the Gun Law Scorecard from Giffords Law Center to quantify firearm policies. Suicide data came from the National Violent Death Reporting System. State- and individual-level GEE Poisson and logistic regression models assessed relationships between policies and firearm- and/or alcohol-involved suicides with a 1-year lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States in 2015, alcohol and/or firearms were involved in 63.9% of suicides. Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 28% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol or firearms. Similarly, a 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 14% decrease in the rate of suicides involving firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These relationships were similar for suicides that involved alcohol and firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 52% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms. A 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 26% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we found synergistic effects between alcohol and firearm policies, such that states with restrictive policies for both alcohol and firearms had the lowest odds of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals, including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found restrictive alcohol and firearm policies to be associated with lower rates and odds of suicides involving alcohol or firearms, and alcohol and firearms and our research suggests that alcohol and firearm policies may be a promising means by which to reduce suicide. These protective relationships were particularly striking for suicides involving both alcohol and firearms as well as in the strong protective interaction between alcohol and firearm policy variables, particularly for suicides involving alcohol. These findings, taken in the context of the broader literature, also suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals (so-called ‘may issue’ laws), including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this was a cross-sectional analysis, this should be considered a hypothesis-generating study that cannot prove a causal association between alcohol or firearm policies and suicide. In future research, studies using multiple years of policy and suicide data would strengthen causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger alcohol and firearm policies are a promising means to prevent a leading and increasing cause of death in the U.S. The findings further suggest that strengthening both policy areas may have a synergistic impact on reducing suicides involving either alcohol, firearms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

Humphries' novel approach to brain exposition is built around — &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; — the spike, the electrical signal neurons use to communicate. In this magical rendition, the 2.1 second journey through the brain takes 174 pages (plus Acknowledgments and Endnotes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the entire book, so this is not a proper book review. But here's an overview of what I might expect. The Introduction is filled with  inventive prose like, “We will wander through the splendor of the richly stocked prefrontal cortex and stand in terror before the wall of noise emanating from the basal ganglia.” (p. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did You Know That Your Life Can Be Reduced To Spikes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the splendor and terror of a life reduced to spikes (p. 3):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“All told, your lifespan is about thirty-four billion billion cortical spikes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spike Drama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will I grow weary of overly dramatic interpretations of spikes? “Our spike's arrival rips open bags of molecules stored at the end of the axon, forcing their contents to be dumped into the gap, and diffuse to the other side.” (p. 29-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for me on the other side of burst vesicles are intriguing chapters on &lt;i&gt;Failure&lt;/i&gt; (dead end spikes) and &lt;i&gt;Dark Neurons&lt;/i&gt;, the numerous weirdos who remain silent while their neighbors are “screaming at the top of [their] lungs.” (p. 83). I anticipate this story like a good mystery novel with wry throwaway observations (p. 82):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Neuroimaging—functional MRI—shows us Technicolor images of the cortex, its regions lit up in a swirling riot of poorly chosen colors that make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pantone&lt;/a&gt; people cry into their tasteful coffee mugs.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s698/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;662&quot; data-original-width=&quot;698&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h303/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Pantone colors of 2021 are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 17-5104 Ultimate Gray&quot;&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 13-0647 Illuminating&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever it ends up – with a mind-blowing new vision of the brain based on spontaneous spikes, or with just another opinion on predictive coding theory – I predict &lt;i&gt;THE SPIKE&lt;/i&gt; will be an epic and entertaining journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s845/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;845&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/w379-h400/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; width=&quot;379&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Why arXiv needs a brand</title>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pop quiz: There are so many “-Xivs” online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer: only &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@arXiv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,” said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the identity project, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessed user feedback collected since 2016,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guide our branding efforts we focused on &lt;b&gt;arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science&lt;/b&gt;. After many rounds of revision and refinement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;arXiv’s first brand guide&lt;/a&gt; was produced, in addition to our new logo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and we’d like to share them with you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_948&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXiv's logo&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-948 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, &lt;strong&gt;the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo&lt;/strong&gt; captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;brand guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt; ensure that we express arXiv’s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,” said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Where is the red nucleus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The red nucleus is found in a region of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/midbrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;midbrain&lt;/a&gt;. There are actually two red nuclei—one on each side of the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures that are generally distinct in function: the parvocellular red nucleus, which mainly contains small and medium-sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt;, and the magnocellular red nucleus, which contains larger neurons. The red nucleus is recognizable immediately after dissection because it maintains a reddish coloring. This coloring is thought to be due to iron pigments found in the cells of the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the red nucleus and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, the red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures with separate functions: the parvocellular red nucleus and the magnocellular red nucleus. In the human brain, most of the red nucleus is made up of the parvocellular red nucleus, or RNp; the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is not thought to play a major role in the adult human brain. In four-legged mammals (e.g., cats, mice), however, the RNm is a more prominent structure—in both size and importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neurons from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; project to the RNm, and RNm neurons leave the red nucleus and form the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/rubrospinal-tract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rubrospinal tract&lt;/a&gt;, which descends in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. In animals that walk on four legs, this pathway is activated around the time of voluntary movements; it seems to play an important role in walking, avoiding obstacles, and making coordinated paw movements. RNm neurons, however, also respond to sensory stimulation, and may provide sensory feedback to the cerebellum to help guide movements and maintain postural stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In primates that mainly walk on two legs (including humans), the RNm is not thought to play a large role in walking and maintaining postural stability, as other tracts (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticospinal-tract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corticospinal tract&lt;/a&gt;) take over such functions. The RNm, however, does appear to be involved in controlling hand movements in humans and other primates. Interestingly, the RNm is more prominent in the human fetus and newborn, but regresses as a child ages, which may have to do with the development of corticospinal tract and the ability to walk on two legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite its relatively greater import in the human brain, the RNp is poorly understood, as its diminished presence in other animals makes it more difficult to study using an animal model. Neurons from motor areas in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/prefrontal-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/premotor-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt;, as well as neurons from nuclei in the cerebellum known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-cerebellar-nuclei&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep cerebellar nuclei&lt;/a&gt;, extend to the RNp. There is also a collection of neurons that leave the RNp and travel to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-olivary-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior olivary nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which communicates with the cerebellum and is thought to be involved in the control of movement. A number of proposed functions have been attributed to these connections between the RNp, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus, such as movement learning, the acquisition of reflexes, and the detection of errors in movements. But the precise function of these pathways—and thus the RNp’s role in them—is still not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Several studies have found the red nucleus to play a role in pain sensation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/analgesia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analgesia&lt;/a&gt;. The latter might be due to connections between the red nucleus and regions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/periaqueductal-gray&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;periaqueductal gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/raphe-nuclei&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raphe nuclei&lt;/a&gt;, which are part of a natural pain-inhibiting system in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In terms of pathology, dysfunction in the human red nucleus has been linked to the development of tremors, and is being investigated as playing a potential role in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Damage to the red nucleus has also been associated with a number of other problems with movement and muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Basile GA, Quartu M, Bertino S, Serra MP, Boi M, Bramanti A, Anastasi GP, Milardi D, Cacciola A.

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/hookah-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water pipe smoking as a public health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Pipe Smoking (WPS) accounts for a significant and growing share of tobacco use globally. WPS is a culture-based method of tobacco use and it has experienced a worldwide re-emergence since 1990 and is regaining popularity among different groups of populations, especially in school and university students. Similarly, WPS is also prevalent among highly educated groups. Although WPS is most prevalent in Asia, specifically the Middle East region and Africa, it has now been changed to a rapidly emerging problem in other continents such as Europe, North, and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that WPS’ smoking rate can be more addictive compared to that of the cigarette. It has a huge negative impact on populations’ health, health costs and the gross domestic product of the countries. WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS. Using deceptive advertising, many cafes and restaurants offer WP services along with their orthodox services in order to earn more profit and lure more customers. The provision of flavored tobacco products or psychotropic WP, the proximity of WP cafe to the public settings such as educational or residential settings and sports clubs, tempting decoration, the provision of study places for students, live music, a variety of games and gambling, and the possibility of watching live movie and sport matches are the factors contribute to attracting children and adolescents to WP cafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the concerns about WPS outcomes and nearly three decades of using control measures, the prevalence of WPS has increased over the world. Due to the unique nature of WP (multi-components), little is known about the prevention and control of WPS. Thus, special interventions might be required to prevent and control WP tobacco use. Accordingly, our study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; aimed to identify the management interventions in international and national levels for preventing and controlling water pipe smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic literature review. Studies aiming at evaluating, at least, one intervention in preventing and controlling WPS were included in this review, followed by performing the quality assessment and data extraction of eligible studies by two independent investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deleting duplications, 2228 out of 4343 retrieved records remained and 38 studies were selected as the main corpus of the present study. The selected studies focused on 19 different countries including the United States (13.15 %), the United Kingdom (7.89 %), Germany (5.26 %), Iran (5.26 %), Egypt (5.26%), Malaysia (2.63%), India (2.63%), Denmark (2.63%), Pakistan (2.63%), Qatar (2.63%), Jordan(2.63%), Lebanon (2.63%), Syria (2.63%), Turkey (2.63%), Bahrain (2.63%), Israel (2.63%), the United Arab Emirates (2.63%), Saudi Arabia (2.63%), and Switzerland (2.63%). Additionally, the type of study design included cross-sectional (31.57 %), quasi-experimental (15.78 %) and qualitative types (23.68 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions that were identified from the content analysis process were discussed and classified into relevant categories. We identified 27 interventions that were grouped into four main categories including preventive (5,18.51%) and control (8, 29.62%) interventions, as well as the enactment and implementation of legislations and policies for controlling WPS at national (7, 25.92%) and international (7, 25.92%) levels. The interventions are shown in the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12287&quot; style=&quot;width: 744px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12287 size-full&quot; height=&quot;727&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-table-Word.png&quot; width=&quot;734&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Table: Effective Interventions in Preventing and Controlling Water Pipe Smoking&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, our findings indicated WPS related social and health crisis have not come into attention in high levels of policy making. The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence. In addition, the WP industry is rapidly expanding without monitoring and controlling measures. Informing and empowering adolescents for those who have not yet experienced smoking is a sensible intervention in this regard. Besides, empowering and involving health students and professionals in WPS control programs can lead to promising results in preventing and controlling WPS. It seems that there is a paucity of evidence regarding strategies on controlling and preventing WTS, thus further research in the society is warranted in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
