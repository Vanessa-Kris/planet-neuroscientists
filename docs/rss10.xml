&lt;p&gt;If you’re a psychopath who’s good with numbers, you could make the perfect hedge fund manager. Your lack of empathy will allow you to capitalise blithely on the financial losses of others, while your ability to stomach high-risk, but potentially high-return, options will send your fund value soaring…. Well, that’s the story that’s been painted by popular media, folk wisdom and Wall Street insiders alike. The problem, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167217733080&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/i&gt;, is that hedge fund managers with psychopathic tendencies actually make &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; money for their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32141&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dacher Keltner at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues analysed videos of semi-structured interviews with 101 hedge fund managers, whose firms each managed between US$40 million and US$1 trillion in assets. This money generally came from institutional investors, such as insurance companies and public and private pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos had been recorded between 2005 and 2015 by an investment advisory firm, to act as a marketing tool, and to give existing clients market updates. They followed a set format with the interviewer asking questions like, “What is your outlook on opportunities in the current market?” and “What is your philosophy on risk management?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were looking for non-verbal evidence in the hedge fund managers’ replies of the so-called Dark Triad personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Erratic emotional expression, for example, was taken as a signal of psychopathy. A dominant positioning of the jaw and posture were among the signals of Machiavellianism. Flashy clothes, coy looks, and excessive use of “I” rather than “We”, were among the indicators of narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keltner and his colleagues also analysed the financial performance of each manager’s so-called “flagship fund” – usually the largest fund offered by the company, and the one considered to most reflect the individual manager’s investment process – during the ten-year period that the videos were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machiavellianism had no bearing on performance. Narcissistic hedge fund managers had to make riskier decisions to make the same returns over a given period compared with a less narcissistic manager; as far as an investor is concerned, this would manifest as greater volatility in the value of their investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to psychopathic tendencies, however, the results were more clear cut. For managers who displayed psychopathic tendencies at a level of one standard deviation above the mean, an investment of US$1 million earned US$1,161,694 (15 per cent) &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; over the course of ten years, on average, compared with a manager who ranked average for psychopathy. More extreme psychopathy led to even weaker returns. For example, the same US$1 million investment by a manager who rated two standard deviations above the mean for psychopathy earned 30 per cent less, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the Dark Triad traits have been investigated in the context of hedge fund performance, and unfortunately the study doesn’t reveal the reasons for the counterintuitive results. It may be that, while the individual managers led the hedge funds, innovative ideas from team members are important for effective financial investing – and the more bullying style of managers with more psychopathic traits could have stifled this kind of creative, collaborative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings suggest that investors would be wise to avoid managers with psychopathic and narcissistic tendencies, there are some limitations to be mindful of. The financial data were from a period that included the Global Financial Crisis and the researchers can’t rule out the possibility that Dark Triad traits may be advantageous in other, less financially disastrous, contexts. Also the non-verbal coding procedure – although it’s a valid measure according to earlier research – provides only a rather coarse indication of personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the results tally with another &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; (on which Dacher Keltner was also a co-author), that found US senators with psychopathic tendencies received less support for bills they had proposed. “These two studies, clear examples of real-world performance, cast doubts upon the efficacy of a Dark Triad-based approach to wielding power,” Keltner and his team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9228</link>
	<content:encoded>I recently decided to revisit a 2014 case that regular readers might remember.



Back in 2014, I posted about a terrible piece of statistical 'spin' that somehow made it into the peer-reviewed Journal of Psychiatric Research. The offending authors, led by Swedish psychiatrist Lars H. Thorell, had run a study to determine whether an electrodermal hyporeactivity test was able to predict suicide and suicidal behaviour in depressed inpatients.



Now, the standard way to evaluate the perfor</content:encoded>

These innovative forums increase the visibility of curated, quality research and reliable news and commentary, bridging a gap in relevance that contributes to public misunderstanding of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Channels Program launched with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (VDRR), and as Veterans Day in the US approaches it’s an opportunity to take a moment to relay the channels origin story, highlight the latest content and re-introduce the editors behind this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is imperative that scientists and consumers explore novel and innovative strategies to share research findings. Towards this end, as an editor of the PLOS Channel for Veterans Disability and Rehabilitation Research, I look forward to highlighting research aimed at helping Veterans with disability and/or chronic illness increase function and participation in daily life.”—Lisa Brenner, VDRR Channel Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those intimately involved with the generation, use or reuse of research, channels provide a central information source for the latest developments, whether published in PLOS journals or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beyond Traditional Journal and Editorial Boundaries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global forums for research, news and discussion, all PLOS Channels deliver a similar contemporary layout for easy navigation and reading, developed with feedback from multiple audiences in mind: basic and clinical scientists, policymakers, science journalists, educators, students and patients. The Featured Research section pulls from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179912&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and other &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jcm.asm.org/content/55/10/3057&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A Related Content section contains news, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dspo.mil/Conference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occasional events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and journal commentary that speak &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/indias-ambitious-new-plan-to-conquer-tb-needs-cash-and-commitment-84821&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;directly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and with integrity to the channel topic. Although not peer reviewed, web articles and commentary in the Related Content section are selected by channel editors for the reliability of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/health/tuberculosis-treatment-drugs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, relevance to the topic and when possible, to provide broad perspective on global issues from local journalists. PLOS hopes the mix of quality peer-reviewed research and exploratory journalistic content will help bridge current knowledge and communication gaps between scientists and the lay public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel editors, selected either from existing PLOS Editorial Board members or recruited together with the channel focus, are an integral component of any given channel. Their expertise and ability to bring in supplementary material through commentary, blogs, news and more helps research communities and the public stay up to date with the latest advances, research trends and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/23/world/middleeast/yemen-cholera-humanitarian-crisis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;societal impact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of work in the field of focus. To highlight their foundational work and dedication to this innovative effort in science communication, these editors are profiled at the bottom of the respective channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Stories of Channel Origins&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels originate either from community demand or engaged editors or partners. VDRR provides a new home for the community formerly served by the Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp;amp; Development (JRRD), no longer published by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. VDRR offers international researchers and practitioners a dedicated online space to share and read state-of-the-art research, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2914&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and resources to assist Veterans with chronic illness and disabilities worldwide. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/the-veteran-disability-rehabilitation-research-channel-meet-the-editors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet the four editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Channels and Collections blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/tuberculosis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tuberculosis Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; exemplify the academic strength, community knowledge and dedication to science and medicine this position provides for each channel. The channel was proposed by Dr. Soumya Swaminathan during her tenure as Secretary, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Family Welfare, Government of India, and Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research. In October, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/icmr-chief-soumya-swaminathan-appointed-who-deputy-director-general/article19792489.ece&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swaminathan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was appointed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/dg/leadership-team/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deputy Director-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the World Health Organization in Geneva, the second-highest position at the health agency. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/plos-tuberculosis-channel-meet-the-editors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet both TB Channel editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born as the PLOS Open Source Toolkit: Hardware Collection, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Source Toolkit Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; builds on the success of the Collection and now includes peer-reviewed and web articles addressing software and its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The dedication of this community to all aspects of open source in advancing science and medicine was a determining factor in transitioning this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to a PLOS Channel. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/the-open-source-toolkit-meet-the-channel-editors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet the two editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently launched Cholera Channel was proposed by Dr. Andrew Azman, Deputy Editor of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; he is joined as a channel editor by international experts in global health and infectious disease. Those engaged in the fight against cholera include academics, healthcare workers, policymakers, patients and civil society—all sharing a vision that collective action can stop cholera transmission and end cholera deaths through strengthened international collaboration and improved coordination. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2017/10/12/plos-cholera-channel-meet-the-editors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet the four editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Supporting this community, until now with no specialist journal or centralized publication venue for their work, is key to PLOS Channels’ mission to serve as resources for research communities.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current Editor’s Picks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Channel showcases an Editor’s Pick, updated regularly, to bring the latest research front and center to readers. On the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VDRR Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the latest Editor’s Pick covers a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185613&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study for early screening of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using voicing tasks and text-dependent speech options, published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/tuberculosis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tuberculosis Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focus on research that demonstrates an &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;diagnostic test commonly used to accurately detect &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; complex and rifampin resistance in high-incidence TB settings &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186139&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;performs comparably&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in low TB-incidence settings. Editors of the Open Source Toolkit Channel chose to feature a &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; Community Page describing a tool for ethomics, the high-throughput approach to behavioral studies. “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003026&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ethoscopes: An open platform for high-throughput ethomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” originated as a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/05/113647.article-info&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint on bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and describes open source software and hardware solutions for monitoring animal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/cholera&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cholera Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; highlights “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183100&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Identification of burden hotspots and risk factors for cholera in India: An observational study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” describing disease hotspots and risk factors for transmission. Using district-level data from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program, the authors offer their open research results to policymakers for development of a cholera prevention and control roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From epidemiological studies using existing census data to translational research and innovations for behavioral studies of experimental model organisms, these diverse choices highlight channel editors’ broad perspective in curating content of interest for their scholarly communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Focus on Cholera: PLOS’ Newest Channel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While universal access to safe water and appropriate sanitation is the key to cholera prevention, global progress towards these goals has been slow. The disease remains a global public health threat, with ongoing risk factors that include poor sanitation, lack of enough clean drinking water and poverty. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/cholera&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cholera Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; features articles on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;applied&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006838&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research related to the global fight against this disease and spans a range of topics with application to cholera prevention and control, including computational studies exploring the dynamics and spread of cholera; epidemiologic studies and translational science. Also covered is applied field research on the efficacy, effectiveness and impact of cholera control programs such as water and sanitation interventions and oral cholera vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS aspires to put &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/where-next-for-plos-working-together-to-make-waves-in-scientific-communication/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers back at the center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of science communication, working in the best interests of all stakeholders—for the benefit of science and the public. Innovations such as the Channels Program, with collaboration from like-minded organizations, push the boundaries of scientific publishing beyond traditional journal, publisher and editorial constraints. Additional channels are currently in planning; bookmark &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://channels.plos.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or your Channel of interest and check back every two weeks for the latest research, news and developments.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Forging Connections: Are early interventions effective?</title>
	<link>https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/06/are-early-interventions-effective/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Early years interventions can seem a particularly powerful way to forestall developmental difficulties. The wide-ranging evidence that early cognitive and behavioural difficulties can predict lifelong outcomes&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/feed/ #_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/feed/ #_edn2&quot; name=&quot;_ednref2&quot;&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes it seem obvious that if a child is struggling, intervening earlier is better. This has led to considerable interest in intervening within the first few years of a child’s life, and the temptation to seek out earlier indicators of children’s cognitive development and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;However, there are several challenges with choosing effective early interventions. First, reliably identifying which children will require support is a substantial challenge. This is particularly evident in the case of language development. Children’s language is a rich area for research on early intervention, for several reasons: it provides a window onto learning at school entry, and weak language at school entry is a risk factor for poor educational, social and emotional outcomes in subsequent years. There is also a clear socio-economic gradient in children’s language abilities, in which children from lower socio-economic backgrounds tend to have weaker language skills than their peers before they start school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(But is the story really so simple?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Despite this, children’s language abilities are highly variable and volatile before they are 4-5 years old, which makes the early identification of children who may be in need of intervention non-trivial. This is demonstrated by several studies showing that whilst children’s early vocabulary around 2 years of age &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; predict their later vocabulary and reading skills at school entry, this predictive power is very small. Only about 10-20%&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/feed/ #_edn3&quot; name=&quot;_ednref3&quot;&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/feed/ #_edn4&quot; name=&quot;_ednref4&quot;&gt;[iv]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the variation in children’s abilities at school is typically predicted by their early language skills, which indicates that there are multiple other factors that shape children’s outcomes. This also suggests that finding a sufficiently sensitive marker of early difficulties is challenging because of how much a child’s abilities can shift and develop over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This relates to the second challenge: early interventions can struggle to have sustained impacts unless intervention is ongoing. A good example of this comes from a recent study by McGillion and colleagues (2017). The researchers were interested in whether a caregiver intervention to promote talking with their 11-month old child would lead to changes in both parenting approach and children’s language development. Caregivers from a range of socio-economic backgrounds were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: watching a short video about talking with their child, or a control video about dental hygiene. One month later the caregivers in the language video condition talked more with their children than those in the control video condition. This fed into vocabulary improvement in the low socio-economic group: children in the intervention condition had higher vocabularies at 15 and 18 months compared to children in the control condition. However, at 24 months these benefits had disappeared, and there was no effect of the intervention on children’s vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These findings demonstrate several important points about early interventions. Interventions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have a positive impact: in this case a brief, low-intensity video intervention was able to positively change caregiver behaviour, and this may have helped gains in children’s vocabulary a few months later. However, these effects were not sustained over time: they had faded by the time children were 2 years old. This shows how critical longer-term follow-ups are in intervention studies to understand whether benefits are long lasting. Moreover, this result reminds us that without ongoing support it is difficult for early gains in one area of cognition to offset other challenges children might face. The promise of early interventions means there can be an assumption that they will permanently shift a child’s trajectory. In reality this is often not the case, and initial gains may often require ongoing support to have real long-term effects for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;It is important to therefore strike a balance between the promises and limitations of early interventions. Whilst endeavouring to find the right areas to target is undoubtedly valuable, the challenge of finding reliable indicators of difficulties early in a child’s life might mean searching for stable predictors at later ages (e.g. from school entry) may be a more fruitful approach&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/feed/ #_edn5&quot; name=&quot;_ednref5&quot;&gt;[v]&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, long-term follow-ups to interventions may be key to understanding the extent to which they are effective. The challenge of early interventions is that development is complex and shaped by multiple factors. Working within these constraints may help us better identify and help children in need of ongoing support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychology research has tended to portray solitude as an unpleasant experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ac.els-cdn.com/027322979090008R/1-s2.0-027322979090008R-main.pdf?_tid=37436a9e-c2f8-11e7-890f-00000aacb35d&amp;amp;acdnat=1509975879_39d803157dfe7b76706a2d52e725d31e&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1978.tb00191.x/abstract&quot;&gt;conducted&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s and 1990s suggested a clear pattern: people usually felt less happy when alone as compared with having company. More recently, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/03/is-it-the-darkness-within-some-people-would-rather-shock-themselves-with-electricity-than-spend-time-with-their-own-thoughts/&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that their volunteers preferred to give themselves mild electric shocks than sit in silence with their own thoughts. However, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217733073&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, a research team led by They-vy Nguyen at the University of Rochester explains the shortcomings in this earlier research and presents a more nuanced picture, showing how 15 minutes solitude can have beneficial effects on our emotions. Their results suggest that if you want to lower the intensity of your emotions, positive and negative, time spent alone may be just the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32021&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research from the 70s and 90s measured emotion on a scale from positive to negative, overlooking the possibility that our positive and negative emotions can fluctuate independently, and that both positive and negative emotions can be either high arousal (such as excitement or anger) or low arousal (such as calmness and loneliness). Meanwhile, the electric shock research involved volunteers being instructed that they must actively think, which may have been aversive as compared with simply being in solitude without more specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new paper, Nguyen’s team first asked 75 student participants to spend 15 minutes sitting alone in a comfortable chair at the psych lab, away from their digital devices and without engaging in any activity. For comparison, 39 other students spent the same time chatting with a research assistant. Before and after this 15 minute period, all the students completed a questionnaire measuring their “high arousal” positive and negative emotions (examples being excited, interested, scared, distressed). The results were clear: the participants in the solitude condition, but not the comparison group, showed reductions in their positive and negative emotions – what the researchers described as a “deactivation effect”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study with more students found the same deactivating effect of 15 minutes of solitude on high arousal emotions, but also added in a measure of low-arousal positive and negative emotions (such as calm, relaxed, sad, lonely) and found that these were increased by time alone. It seems solitude doesn’t have a simple emotional effect that can be caricatured as good or bad; rather, it changes the intensity of our inner experience, both positive and negative: accentuating low-key emotions, while dialling down our stronger feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern was found for a comparison group who spent the time alone reading a moderately interesting article rather than in their own thoughts, suggesting that complete mental disengagement from an external task is not necessary for solitude to have its emotional effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you think about when you’re alone surely has some bearing on the emotional effects of solitude: the researchers investigated this in another study, as well as looking into whether it matters whether you choose the tone of your thoughts or follow someone else’s instructions. Choosing the content of one’s own thoughts, rather than following instructions, was preferable in terms of reducing high arousal negative emotions and boosting low arousal positive ones. However, it’s also true that time alone with positive thoughts – whether by choice or through following instructions – was advantageous, as compared with having neutral thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers asked 157 students to keep an evening diary for two weeks to track their emotions. Half the students were instructed to spend 15 minutes in device-free solitude daily during the first week; the other half of the students did this in the second week. Again, the de-activation effect was observed: the week that the students spent time in solitude, they tended to show reduced high arousal positive and negative emotions. There was also an apparent deactivation spill-over into the second week for those who completed the solitude exercises in the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth clarifying that these findings pertain to relatively brief moments of solitude as distinct from prolonged loneliness, which is known to be associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;a host of unwelcome physical and psychological effects&lt;/a&gt;. Also, bear in mind the current findings could vary across cultures and with older volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nguyen and her colleagues said more research needs to be done, but that the “take-home message is that there are benefits and detriments of solitude.” They added their studies suggest “that people can use solitude, or other variations on being alone, to regulate their affective states, becoming quiet after excitement, calm after an angry episode, or centred and peaceful when desired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new results may also be seen as a complement to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/05/researchers-say-dont-worry-what-other-people-think-going-out-on-your-own-can-be-fun/&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published two years ago that made the case that people generally enjoy going out on their own in public more than they think they will.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/11/06/why-should-we-care-about-medical-students-unprofessional-behaviour/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/Fotolia_75984055_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced your doctor behaving unprofessionally? Perhaps you have felt uncomfortable, or worse, have questioned your safety? Did you wonder if doctors are taught how to behave professionally during their training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, patient safety can indeed be threatened by the unprofessional behavior of physicians. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMsa052596&quot;&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that this can be predicted by a physician’s behavior as a medical student. It’s no surprise then, that medical schools all over the world are increasingly paying attention to teaching and assessing professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, medical teachers often show a reluctance to fail students behaving unprofessionally, mainly because they do not know what to document or are afraid to be subjective, and therefore hesitate to take action. Professionalism guidelines describe what is expected regarding professional behavior, but do not always specifically describe what constitutes the &lt;em&gt;unprofessional&lt;/em&gt; behavior of undergraduate medical students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionalism guidelines describe what is expected regarding professional behavior, but do not always specifically describe what constitutes the &lt;em&gt;unprofessional&lt;/em&gt; behavior of undergraduate medical students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an educational guideline could mention the importance of accountability, but does not make clear what would be the specific manifestation of a lack of accountability by a medical student. Although the General Medical Council has recently updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmc-uk.org/Achieving_good_medical_practice_0816.pdf_66086678.pdf&quot;&gt;their guideline&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as ‘Tomorrow’s doctors’) to now indicate normative domains of concern, an overview of real-life behaviors that are actually seen by teachers and peer students at medical school, or in the hospital, did not yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My co-authors and I, all teachers in medical professionalism, are often consulted by colleagues who seek confirmation before denominating certain student behavior as unprofessional. We also notice that medical teachers often use indirect language while describing unprofessional behaviors in assessment forms such as: ‘&lt;em&gt;professional attitude has to improve&lt;/em&gt;’ or ‘&lt;em&gt;needs to read more&lt;/em&gt;’. Such remarks do not make clear what the teacher actually saw, and what aspect he/she thinks that the student must pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear descriptors providing a common language for unprofessional behavior could offer teachers a tool for recognizing and denominating unprofessional behavior, and could support them in acknowledging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we set up a literature search to find descriptors of medical students’ unprofessional behaviors that were actually experienced by medical teachers or students themselves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0997-x&quot;&gt;Findings of this research project&lt;/a&gt; have recently been published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 4 I’s of unprofessionalism &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compiled evidence from 46 research papers and found that medical students can behave unprofessionally in at least 205 different ways. We grouped these 205 descriptions into 30 descriptors, and organized them into 4 main themes. These four themes are indicated as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4 I’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Involvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (failure to engage: e.g. being late, poor initiative, avoiding patient contact),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (dishonest behaviors: lying, fraud in exams, data falsification),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interaction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (disrespectful behavior: discrimination, poor communication, lack of sensitivity to another person’s needs) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (poor self-awareness: not accepting feedback, lack of awareness of another person’s needs, blaming external factors rather than one’s own inadequacies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early transparent discussion among teacher and student about the teacher’s observations can make medical students aware of their (often unintended) unprofessional behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the 4 I’s seemed to appear fairly consistently in research papers coming out of different continents: similar themes of concern exist globally. However, attention for them did not arise everywhere at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporal trend we found is that, around 1980, North-American researchers started studying unprofessional behavior of medical students, firstly emphasizing &lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;, followed by attention for &lt;em&gt;Interaction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Involvement&lt;/em&gt;. From 2000 on, researchers in other parts of the world also started to investigate &lt;em&gt;Integrity &lt;/em&gt;problems. Around 2000, North-American researchers moved forward to study &lt;em&gt;Insight,&lt;/em&gt; quickly followed by their colleagues in Europe and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if a similar trend will arise in the rapidly growing body of literature on this topic coming from South America, Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical teachers should care about their students’ unprofessional behavior. They should not be afraid to be subjective, but take action by openly discussing their observations with the student. The framework of &lt;em&gt;The 4 I’s&lt;/em&gt; can help them, as it serves as a tool providing a common language for describing students’ unprofessional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early transparent discussion among teacher and student about the teacher’s observations can make medical students aware of their (often unintended) unprofessional behaviors, and could inform teachers about underlying personal, interpersonal or institutional causes for the behavior. By discussing such behaviors, without blaming the student, but with the goal of offering help, teachers can contribute to the prevention of future professionalism lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this research article we hope to help medical students and teachers alike in creating a culture of professionalism in medical school, which is not only beneficial for the aspiring doctors, but ultimately for the safety of their future patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What does Gödel's theorem mean ?</title>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-does-godels-theorem-mean/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems&quot;&gt;Gödel's theorem&lt;/a&gt; is a result in mathematical logic, which is often stated as showing that « there are true things that cannot proved ». It is sometimes used to comment on the limits of science, or the superiority of human intuition. Here I want to clarify what this theorem means and what the epistemological implications are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;First, this phrasing is rather misleading. It makes the result sound almost mystical. If you phrase the result differently, by avoiding the potentially confusing reference to truth, the result is not that mystical anymore. Here is how I would phrase it : you can always add an independent axiom to a finite system of axioms. This is not an obvious mathematical result, but I wouldn't think it defies intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Why is this equivalent to the first phrasing ? If the additional axiom is independent of the set of axioms, then it cannot be proved from them (by definition). Yet as a logical proposition it has to be either true or not true. So it is true, or its negation is true, but it cannot be proved. What is misleading in the first phrasing is that the statement « there are true things » is contextual. I can start from a set of axioms and add one, and that new one will be true (since it's an axiom). Instead I could add its negation, and then that one will be true. That the proposition is true is not a universal truth, as it would seem with the phrasing « there are true things ». It is true in a particular mathematical world, and you can consider another one where it is not true. Famous examples are Euclidean and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry&quot;&gt;non-Euclidean geometries&lt;/a&gt;, which are mutually inconsistent sets of axioms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;So, what Gödel's theorem says is simply that no finite system of axioms is complete, in the sense that you can always add one without making the system inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;What are the epistemological implications ? It does not mean that there are things that science cannot prove. Laws of physics are not proved by deduction anyway. They are hypothesized and empirically tested, and all laws are provisory. Nevertheless, it does raise some deep philosophical questions, which have to do with reductionism. I am generally critical of &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xi-reductionism/&quot;&gt;reductionism&lt;/a&gt;, but more specifically of methodological reductionism, the idea that a system can be understood by understanding the elements that compose it. For example : understand neurons and you will understand the brain. I think this view is wrong, because it is the relations between neurons, at the scale of the organism, which make a brain. The right approach is systemic rather than reductionist. Many scientists frown at criticisms of reductionism, but this is only because they confuse methodological and ontological reductionism. Ontological reductionism means that reality can be reduced to a small number of types of things (eg atoms) and laws, and everything can be understood in these terms. For example, the mind can in principle be understood in terms of interactions of atoms that constitute the brain. Most scientists seem to believe in ontological reductionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Let us go back now to Gödel's theorem. An interesting remark made by theoretical biologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosen_(theoretical_biologist)&quot;&gt;Robert Rosen&lt;/a&gt; is that Gödel's theorem makes ontological reductionism implausible to him. Why ? The theorem says that, whatever system of axioms you choose, it will always be possible to add one which is independent. Let us say we have agreed on a small set of fundamental physical laws, with strong empirical support. To establish each law, we postulate it and test it empirically. At a macroscopic level, scientists postulate and test all sorts of laws. How can we claim that any macroscopic law necessarily derives from the small set of fundamental laws ? Gödel's theorem says that there are laws that you can express but that are independent of the fundamental laws. This means that there are laws that can only be established empirically, not formally, in fact just like the set of fundamental laws. Of course it could be the case that most of what matters to us is captured by a small of set of laws. But maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structure of the human MHC-I peptide-loading complex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/WVAZLCtj-yk/nature24627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The peptide-loading complex (PLC) is a transient, multisubunit membrane complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that is essential for establishing a hierarchical immune response. The PLC coordinates peptide translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum with loading and editing of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. After final proofreading in the PLC, stable peptide–MHC-I complexes are released to the cell surface to evoke a T-cell response against infected or malignant cells. Sampling of different MHC-I allomorphs requires the precise coordination of seven different subunits in a single macromolecular assembly, including the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and TAP2, jointly referred to as TAP), the oxidoreductase ERp57, the MHC-I heterodimer, and the chaperones tapasin and calreticulin. The molecular organization of and mechanistic events that take place in the PLC are unknown owing to the heterogeneous composition and intrinsically dynamic nature of the complex. Here, we isolate human PLC from Burkitt’s lymphoma cells using an engineered viral inhibitor as bait and determine the structure of native PLC by electron cryo-microscopy. Two endoplasmic reticulum-resident editing modules composed of tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57, and MHC-I are centred around TAP in a pseudo-symmetric orientation. A multivalent chaperone network within and across the editing modules establishes the proofreading function at two lateral binding platforms for MHC-I molecules. The lectin-like domain of calreticulin senses the MHC-I glycan, whereas the P domain reaches over the MHC-I peptide-binding pocket towards ERp57. This arrangement allows tapasin to facilitate peptide editing by clamping MHC-I. The translocation pathway of TAP opens out into a large endoplasmic reticulum lumenal cavity, confined by the membrane entry points of tapasin and MHC-I. Two lateral windows channel the antigenic peptides to MHC-I. Structures of PLC captured at distinct assembly states provide mechanistic insight into the recruitment and release of MHC-I. Our work defines the molecular symbiosis of an ABC transporter and an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone network in MHC-I assembly and provides insight into the onset of the adaptive immune response.

The reward system is a complex circuit composed of several interconnected brain structures responsible for incentive salience, associative learning, reinforcement and positive emotions (i.e. pleasure). One of the most critical regions of this system is represented by the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a hub region that receives and sends information. Several cellular and molecular modifications have been observed at the level of the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc, but we are still far from having a clear picture of their detailed mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;
In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185796&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE article&lt;/a&gt;, Mittal and colleagues (University of California Los Angeles, UCLA) decided to investigate the role of a family of proteins, the β-arrestins, in reward-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;β&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-arrestins: how do they work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;β-arrestins are versatile adapter proteins that form complexes with most G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) following ligand binding and consequent activation of the receptors. It is well known that they play a critical role in the interrelated processes of GPCR desensitization and sequestration, which in turn lead to the termination of G protein activation and signaling cascades. This causes specific dampening of cellular responses to specific stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters, or sensory signals. While β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2) has been implicated in several aspects of reward-related learning and behaviors, very little is known about the behavioral function of β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1). Both isoforms regulate remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to influence chemotaxis and trafficking of specific G-protein coupled receptors and they are ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;β&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-arrestins and the brain reward system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their article, Mittal and colleagues hypothesized that β-arr1, “&lt;em&gt;may influence basal glutamatergic signaling and cocaine-induced adaptations of this &lt;/em&gt;[the glutamatergic]&lt;em&gt; excitatory system within the NAc&lt;/em&gt;”. This would alter specific aspects of reward processing. Thus, using β-arr1 knock-out (KO) mice as well as behavioral and electrophysiological assays to examine this hypothesis the authors have defined specific roles of β-arr1 and glutamate receptors NMDA-Rs in reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, mice lacking β-arr1 showed a delay in the initial phases of both the acquisition and extinction of cocaine self-administration, a behavioral test that allows researchers to study changes in distinct aspects of drug-taking behavior that model behaviors observed in drug addicts. This first set of behavioral results indicate that β-arr1 is involved in regulating the acquisition and extinction of instrumental cocaine self-administration. To determine whether these impairments induced by β-arr1 deletion could be generalized to other rewarding stimuli, the authors conducted a series of experiments using a battery of food-motivated behaviors. Surprisingly, β-arr1 KO mice also showed an impairment in developing Pavlovian conditioned (goal-directed) behavior and in the amount of efforts needed to obtain palatable food. Altogether these results suggest that β-arr1 may play a central role in driving reward-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in order to fully explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral performances observed in β-arr1 KO mice, Mittal et al. performed electrophysiological recordings at the level of the excitatory glutamatergic synapses of the NAc. It must be mentioned that glutamatergic transmission within the nucleus accumbens is a central component of reward-related adaptations. The synaptic strength was then measured as the AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratio. “&lt;em&gt;We found that deleting β-arr1 increased the A/N ratio and reduced GluN2B-NMDARs in NAc shell MSNs&lt;/em&gt;”, say Nitish Mittal, the leading author of the paper.&lt;br /&gt;
Since β-arr1 plays an important role in regulating actin turnover to modulate exocytosis and endocytosis it may be possible that actin dynamics regulate the trafficking of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptors. In fact, pharmacological blockade of actin remodeling was able to alter synaptic strength in wildtype littermates but not in β-arr1 KO mice, thus suggesting a molecular link between β-arr1 and NMDA receptors. “&lt;em&gt;Based on our findings&lt;/em&gt;”, say Wendy Walwyn, the senior author of the study, “&lt;em&gt;it is possible that deleting β-arr1, or inactivating cofilin &lt;/em&gt;[actin dynamics]&lt;em&gt;, disrupts actin turnover and microtubule disassembly to reduce the transport of GluN2B-containing NMDARs to the cell membrane, or stability once in place&lt;/em&gt;”. Given the fact that β-arr1 genetic ablation disrupts GluN2B-NMDA receptor functions, the authors investigated whether chronic inhibition of GluN2B-NMDA receptors in the NAc would produce similar behavioral impairments as observed in β-arr1 KO mice.&lt;br /&gt;
At the behavioral level, pharmacological inactivation of GluN2B subunits significantly inhibited instrumental lever pressing behavior in WT littermates, thus suggesting a potential link between NMDA and β-arr1. However, the same pharmacological strategy was not performed in β-arr1 KO mice, thus making the final assumption not definitively proved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Although further studies are needed to fully define the underlying cellular mechanisms and causal relationships, this study is the first to examine the role of this arrestin isoform in reward-motivated behaviors&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Cracking the Code–Revealing the Secret Behind Our Perception</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/03/cracking-the-code-revealing-the-secret-behind-our-perception/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you’re an eye doctor, and I’ve spent my entire career as one, you learn a lot about how people use, and misuse, the sense of sight to perceive the world around them. As humans, we’re constantly interpreting and occasionally manipulating our experiences to distinguish fantasy from reality. Some people are better at this than others. Some, for example, are consistently taken in by conspiracy theories or fake news stories, whereas others can quickly sniff them out as bogus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I asked myself-what’s the difference between people with keen powers of perception and those with weaker powers? Is it education? Experience? Genetics? I began researching the topic and discovered there isn’t even a term to classify our power of perception, so I adopted one. I call it &lt;em&gt;perceptual intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Perceptual-Intelligence-Illusion-Misperception-Self-Deception/dp/160868475X&quot;&gt;my new book&lt;/a&gt; (in bookstores this month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perceptual Intelligence,” (or PI), is our ability to interpret sensory data and arrive at a decision.  Just as with other forms of intelligence, some people have higher PI than others. Good decision-makers exhibit a high level of Perceptual Intelligence, whereas bad decision-makers demonstrate weaker PI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PI, I learned, is an acquired skill. We can improve our PI, in fact, through awareness and practice.  You may, for instance, find yourself overreacting to certain situations or circumstances. But with proper knowledge and a different perspective, you can train yourself to arrive at a more appropriate reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced digital age, where we’re often forced to make decisions on the fly; we often “leap before we look.”  That might mean handing over your credit card number without verifying a website’s security, or trusting a news story without considering the integrity of the source. People with high PI, however, consistently “look before they leap.” Before making a decision, they ask themselves, instinctively: Am I interpreting this sensory data correctly and making the best choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every millisecond, our senses take in a massive amount of information, which then travels to the brain.  The brain, in turn, is where our perceptions originate. Those perceptions may accurately reflect reality but may also derail us toward fantasy. The driving question behind my book is: Why do our perceptions sometimes clash with reality? There are many reasons, I discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is medical. For example, a condition known as synesthesia can cause a person to literally see music or taste sounds. (A second form of synesthesia connects objects such as letters and numbers with a sensory perception such as color or taste.) Even the common cold, which affects the eyes, ears, nose, and throat—not to mention the brain, when our heads fill with congestion—has been known to distort our power of perception. When we are under the weather from the flu, our power of perception might seem so foggy that we develop a pessimistic view of situations that we might otherwise view with optimism. Another medical factor influencing perception is sleep deprivation. As any insomniac or parent of a newborn will tell you, a lack of sleep can distort our perception of the world, sometimes even fogging our memory of what happened during our sleepless state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obvious (and sometimes deadly) influence on our power of perception is drugs and alcohol. We don’t need to review criminal cases and “beer goggle” studies to see how drugs and alcohol impair our senses and affect our judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also our psychology, biology, genetics, habits, cultural upbringing, and memories, all of which combine to create our unique perceptual filter, influencing our decisions, thoughts and beliefs. The pope’s belief in life after death, for example, is diametrically opposed to that of theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss’. Yet each is convinced that his view is the correct one. Is the pope blinded by faith? Is Dr. Krauss closed to any idea that isn’t evidence-based? We all create a version of the world unlike anyone else’s. And how could it not be? It is shaped by &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, we mold our perceptions like Play-Doh to suit the story we create of our lives. But sometimes our perceptions work behind the scenes, shaping our thoughts and behaviors without us realizing.  When we have a vague memory of a painful incident, what purpose does it serve? Why do we hold onto an incorrect and hurtful perception when instead we could make something good of it? People with finely-tuned PI can identify and topple faulty ideas that try to sabotage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of strong perceptual intelligence is recognizing that your mind is more plastic than you think and can be molded. PI can be improved, like any other skill, such as driving a car, playing a sport, or learning an instrument.  Improving PI can have a profound effect on your life. Better decisions can reduce the risk of financial, health, family problems, and other issues that can arise from low perceptual intelligence.  You could say, therefore, that high PI even improves happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler, M.D., an expert in human perception, is America’s TV Eye Doctor and internationally renowned for his expertise in Keratoconus treatments, LASIK and other vision correction procedures. His book, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Perceptual-Intelligence-Illusion-Misperception-Self-Deception/dp/160868475X&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perceptual Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (published by New World Library), is available in bookstores October 17, 2017 on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, and Indie Bound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clocks have gone back and there’s a chill in the air. It’s well known that during these darker months, a significant minority of us experience unwelcome negative changes to our mood (at least if you believe in the notion of Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/debunking-the-myth-of-the-winter-blues.html&quot;&gt;which not all experts do&lt;/a&gt;). Now an intriguing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178116307296?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt; has explored the link this condition may have with another psychiatric diagnosis, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that people with OCD are more likely than average to experience seasonal effects on their mood, and that for these seasonally sensitive people with OCD, their “compulsions” are worse in the colder months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31914&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already established that some of the underlying neurophysiology of SAD and OCD is the same, involving dysfunction of the neurotransmitter serotonin, note the study authors Oğuz Tan and his colleagues at Uskudar University in Turkey. They also point to past research that has shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/7/654/204611/Seasonal-Variations-in-Mental-Disorders-in-the&quot;&gt;the prevalence of OCD is highest in Autumn&lt;/a&gt;, and that light therapy, used to treat SAD, has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(03)00003-X/fulltext&quot;&gt;shown to benefit some people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further study the links between OCD and SAD, Tan and his team recruited 104 people in Istanbul diagnosed with OCD (and most of whom were on drug treatments) and 125 local controls without OCD (controls were included if they had other mental health problems, unless they were considered too severe, such as a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire about their sensitivity to seasonal effects on mood and behaviour, including sleep and social activity. The participants diagnosed with OCD also completed a questionnaire about their OCD-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants with OCD reported greater seasonal sensitivity (mostly to colder months) – in fact, based on the extremity of their scores and how much they felt the effects were problematic, 19 per cent showed signs of SAD compared with just 9 per cent of the controls. What’s more, among this sub-group who had OCD combined with SAD, their depression symptoms and compulsions (the actions or thoughts they perform to cope with their disturbing thoughts or mental images) were worse when they were tested in their least favoured time of year. Finally, when participants with OCD and Winter/Autumn-related SAD were tested in these cooler months, the severity of their compulsions correlated with the shortness of the daylight hours on the day of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results indicate that seasonal changes in mood frequently co-occur with OCD, which denotes that OCD and mood seasonality may share a common etiology,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t know why there was a seasonal association with OCD-related compulsions but not “obsessions” (troubling thoughts or mental images). They also acknowledged their study’s drawbacks, including the dependence on participants’ own reports of their OCD and SAD-related symptoms (the measure of seasonal sensitivity in particular is not a true diagnostic test), and the cross-sectional design. More convincing would be to measure people’s OCD-related symptoms over time and see if they fluctuate with the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan and his colleagues believe the topic merits further study, especially to determine “the effect of SAD on the quality of life, prognosis, and risk of suicide and treatment response in patients with OCD”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178116307296?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Seasonal mood changes in patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience discovered local order of dendritic spine functional properties within global disorder, a key underlying feature of the synaptic architecture of visual space.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons are the basic information processing structures in the brain and are composed of three main parts: dendrites, axons, and the soma. Dendrites receive and integrate synaptic inputs that are subsequently processed in the soma and relayed to other neurons via axons. A longstanding question has been to understand how synaptic inputs are arranged on the elaborate dendritic structures of individual neurons in order to better comprehend how dendrites process and transform inputs, ultimately influencing how we perceive the world around us. Recent discoveries in the laboratory of David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., Scientific Director and CEO at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), have shed more light on this issue and the universal properties of cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Scholl, Ph.D. and Dan Wilson, researchers in the Fitzpatrick lab, have been studying the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs onto dendrites and how this arrangement impacts computations in visual cortex. Previous work by Wilson et al. (2015) revealed that orientation selectivity and functional clustering of synaptic inputs in visual cortical neurons correlates with localized dendritic events, sharpening somatic tuning. In their recent paper, published in Neuron on November 2nd, Scholl and Wilson examined whether this clustering exists at a finer scale and across the diversity of functional inputs cortical cells receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate fine-scale synaptic clustering, the researchers presented simple visual stimuli to activate individual excitatory inputs onto individual dendritic spines, small mushroom-shaped protrusions on the dendritic arbors. These visual stimuli allowed the authors to map spatial receptive fields – regions in visual space where stimuli elicit responses from particular neurons or synaptic inputs – and polarity – the preference for luminance increments (ON) or decrements (OFF). Large numbers of spines on individual layer 2/3 neurons were mapped and visualized using in vivo two-photon imaging of a genetically encoded calcium indicator, providing a measure of subcellular and cellular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within individual dendritic branches and across the dendritic field, they found no evidence for a global organization. Upon closer inspection, however, they discovered robust functional synaptic clustering locally. Neighboring spines separated by less than 10 μm share similar functional properties across the diversity of sensory features they encode. Further, neighboring spines exhibit spontaneous and sensory-driven co-activity that can occur independent of global dendritic calcium events, driven largely by action potentials initiated at the soma. Distance-dependent relationships for these features exist at a spatial scale of 5-10 μm, and this omnipresent spatial length constant may indicate a fundamental biological limit to short-range plasticity mechanisms operating within the dendrite. “The clustering of inputs appears more universal than we might have previously thought,” said Scholl. “We are just beginning to appreciate the complexities of the dendritic field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also revealed, via machine learning, that fine-scale functional synaptic clusters exist within the broader population of spines, and these clusters appear to be selective for features both resembling and distinct from the somatic output. Clustered inputs could amplify such functional features, but the role of synaptic clustering in shaping somatic response is more complex. These distributed functional clusters could enhance the computational power of neurons by allowing greater flexibility of responses to a wide range of sensory inputs, increasing dendritic sensitivity without sacrificing dynamic range, and facilitating nonlinear interactions within individual dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciating the integration and processing of distributed networks at the subcellular level is key to understanding organization at the cellular level and beyond. “It is critical that we understand how the inputs to a given neuron are arranged within its dendritic field so that we can understand how individual neurons integrate the information arising from thousands of synaptic inputs,” said Fitzpatrick. What are the consequences of such an arrangement for the function of a neuron and for the network in which it’s embedded? Currently, there is a large gap in our scientific knowledge when it comes to perceiving the role that dendrites play in neuronal circuits. “What makes this paper really exciting,” said Fitzpatrick, “is that it bridges that gap, putting cellular principles in the context of how a network operates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the lab is interested in exploring the development and maturation of spines and synaptic clusters. Ongoing work involves chronic imaging of the structure and function of individual spines during development and changes to visual experience to determine whether emerging spines adopt the same functional properties of their more adjacent, stable predecessors. Such research could provide greater insight into the role of synaptic clustering during development and plasticity mechanisms throughout an individual’s lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, some suicidal individuals  do not signal their intent, and  others do not receive essential assistance. Youths with severe suicidal  ideation are not taken seriously in many cases, and thus are not admitted to  emergency rooms. A common scenario is that resources are scarce, the ER is backed up, and a cursory clinical assessment will determine who is admitted and who will be triaged. From a practical standpoint, using fMRI to determine suicide risk is a non-starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet here we are, with media coverage blaring that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/30/16570148/neuroscience-suicide-mental-health-brain-imagining-fmri-machine-learning-algorithm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Algorithm can identify suicidal people using brain scans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/30/560837881/brain-patterns-may-predict-people-at-risk-of-suicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain Patterns May Predict People At Risk Of Suicide&lt;/a&gt;. These media pieces herald a new study claiming that fMRI can predict suicidal ideation with 91% accuracy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y&quot;&gt;Just et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;). The authors applied a complex algorithm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;) to analyze brain scans obtained using a highly specialized protocol to examine semantic and emotional responses to life and death concepts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me unpack that a bit. The scans of 17 young adults with suicidal ideation (thoughts about suicide) were compared to those from another 17 participants without suicidal ideation. A computer algorithm (Gaussian Naive Bayes) was trained on the neural responses to death-related and suicide-related words, and correctly classified 15 out of 17 suicidal ideators (88% sensitivity) and 16 out of 17 controls (94% specificity). Are these results too good to be true? Yes, probably. And yet they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2010/07/difference-between-p-05-and-screening.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;excellent explanation by Prof Dorothy Bishop&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not good enough&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because two at-risk individuals were not picked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NUzXxsKDyE0/WfqRZS7_90I/AAAAAAAAMUo/N8s16q7QU-4ZNRvwzUpje6KbDPHW3sJXACLcBGAs/s1600/Group%2Bseparation%2Bin%2Bmultidimensional%2Bscaling.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1122&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1012&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NUzXxsKDyE0/WfqRZS7_90I/AAAAAAAAMUo/N8s16q7QU-4ZNRvwzUpje6KbDPHW3sJXACLcBGAs/s400/Group%2Bseparation%2Bin%2Bmultidimensional%2Bscaling.png&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just et al. 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The computational methods used to classify the suicidal vs. control groups are suspect, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tyrell_turing/status/925551007219830784&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Blake Richards&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NeuroStats/status/925836501220442112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Manjari Narayan&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NeuroStats/status/925837032559067136&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;leave-one-out is crap&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/925542409391534080&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Konrad Kording&quot;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonroiser/status/925413535966023683&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Jon Roiser&quot;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/itschekkers/status/925422033776803842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Adam Chekroud&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;.

[&lt;i&gt;n.b. Nock is an author on the Just et al. paper that trashes his earlier work&lt;/i&gt;]. Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424092&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nock et al. (2010)&lt;/a&gt; developed the death/suicide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit-association_test&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Implicit Association Test&lt;/a&gt; (IAT)&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;which was able to identify ER patients at greatest risk for another suicide attempt in the future:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...the implicit association of death/suicide with self was  associated with an approximately 6-fold increase in the odds of making a  suicide attempt in the next 6 months, exceeding the predictive validity  of known risk factors (e.g., depression, suicide-attempt history) and  both patients’ and clinicians’ predictions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;But let's go ahead with an fMRI study that will be far more accurate than a short and easy-to-administer computerized test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly 80% of patients who die by suicide deny suicidal ideation in their last contact with a mental healthcare professional&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-dest=&quot;link:4&quot; data-track-source=&quot;reference-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y#ref-CR4&quot; id=&quot;ref-link-section-d87627e503&quot; title=&quot;Busch, K.

Nonetheless, other research shows that current risk scales are indeed of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/early/2017/03/02/bjp.bp.116.189993&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;limited use&lt;/a&gt; and may even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coyneoftherealm.com/blogs/news/use-of-scales-to-assess-risk-for-a-suicide-attempt-wastes-valuable-clinical-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waste valuable clinical resources&lt;/a&gt;. The scales “may be missing &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/early/2017/03/02/bjp.bp.116.189993&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;important aspects&lt;/a&gt; relevant to repeat suicidal behaviour (for example social, cultural, economic or psychological processes).” But a focus on brain scans would also miss social, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you measure the neural correlates of suicidal thoughts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tough one, but the authors propose to uncover the neural signatures of specific concepts, as well as the emotions they evoke:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...the neural signature of the test concepts was treated as a decomposable  biomarker of thought processes that can be used to pinpoint particular  components of the alteration [in participants with suicidal ideation]. This decomposition attempts to specify a  particular component of the neural signature that is altered, namely,  the emotional component...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you choose which concepts and emotions to measure?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “concepts” were &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a64d79;&quot;&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; from three different categories (although the designation of &lt;i&gt;Suicide&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;Negative&lt;/i&gt; seems arbitrary for some of the stimuli). The set of 30 words was presented six times, with each word shown for three seconds followed by a four second blank screen. Subjects were “asked to actively think about the concepts ...  while they were displayed, thinking about their main properties (and  filling in details that come to mind) and attempting consistency across  presentations.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n5-XB5vkdZY/Wfq4bvLIBsI/AAAAAAAAMU8/jthyIXG9X2kcD2jhzhigBNrrGmjKsEobwCLcBGAs/s1600/suicide%2Bwords.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;645&quot; data-original-width=&quot;811&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n5-XB5vkdZY/Wfq4bvLIBsI/AAAAAAAAMU8/jthyIXG9X2kcD2jhzhigBNrrGmjKsEobwCLcBGAs/s400/suicide%2Bwords.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just et al. 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “emotion signatures” were derived from a prior study (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066032&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kassam et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;) that asked method actors to self-induce nine emotional states (anger,  disgust, envy, fear, happiness, lust, pride, sadness, and shame). The emotional states selected for the present study were anger, pride, sadness, and shame (all chosen post hoc). Should we expect emotion signatures that are self-induced by actors to be the same as emotion signatures that are evoked by words? Should we expect a universal emotional response to &lt;i&gt;Comfort&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Evil&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Apathy&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six words (&lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;carefree&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;,  &lt;i&gt;cruelty&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;praise,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trouble&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; in descending order) and five brain regions (left superior medial frontal, medial frontal/anterior cingulate,  right middle temporal, left inferior parietal, and left  inferior frontal) from a whole-brain analysis (that excluded bilateral occipital lobes for some reason) provided the most accurate discrimination between the two groups. Why these specific words and voxels? Twenty-five voxels, specifically. It doesn't matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The neural representation of each concept, as used by the classifier,  consisted of the mean activation level of the five most stable voxels in  each of the five most discriminating locations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;...and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;All of these regions, especially the left superior medial frontal area  and medial frontal/anterior cingulate, have repeatedly been strongly  associated with self-referential thought... &lt;/blockquote&gt;...and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...the concept of ‘death’ evoked  more shame, whereas the concept of ‘trouble’ evoked more sadness in the  suicidal ideator group. ‘Trouble’ also evoked less anger in the suicidal  ideator group than in the control group. The positive concept  ‘carefree’ evoked less pride in the suicidal ideator group. This pattern  of differences in emotional response suggests that the altered  perspective in suicidal ideation may reflect a resigned acceptance of a  current or future negative state of affairs, manifested by listlessness,  defeat and a degree of anhedonia (less pride evoked in the concept of  ‘carefree’) [&lt;i&gt;why not less pride to 'praise' or 'superior'? who knows...&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841687/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Circular analysis in systems neuroscience: the dangers of double dipping&quot;&gt;circularity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661305003360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Can cognitive processes be inferred from neuroimaging data?&quot;&gt;reverse inference&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15647155&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;HARKing: hypothesizing after the results are known&quot;&gt;HARKing&lt;/a&gt; or anything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can a method that excludes data from 55% of the target participants be useful??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems like a showstopper. A total of 38 suicidal participants were scanned, but those who did not show the desired semantic effects were excluded due to “poor data quality”:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The neurosemantic analyses ... are based on 34 participants, 17  participants per group whose fMRI data quality was sufficient for  accurate (normalized rank accuracy &amp;gt; 0.6) identification of the 30  individual concepts from their fMRI signatures. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The selection of  participants included in the primary analyses was based only on the  technical quality of the fMRI data. The data quality was assessed in  terms of the ability of a classifier to identify which of the 30  individual concepts they were thinking about with a rank accuracy of at  least 0.6, based on the neural signatures evoked by the concepts. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The  participants who met this criterion also showed less head motion (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;(77) = 2.73, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).  The criterion was not based on group discriminability.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This logic seems circular to me, despite the claim that inclusion wasn't based on group classification accuracy. Seriously, if you throw out over half of your subjects, how can your method ever be useful? Nonetheless, the 21 “poor data quality” ideators with excessive head motion and bad semantic signatures were used in an out-of-sample analysis that also revealed relatively high classification accuracy (87%) compared to the data from the same 17 “good” controls (the data from 24 “bad” controls were excluded, apparently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;We attribute the suboptimal fMRI data quality (inaccurate concept identification from its neural signature) of the excluded participants to some combination of excessive head motion and an inability to sustain attention to the task of repeatedly thinking about each stimulus concept for 3 s over a 30-min testing period. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, another classifier was even more accurate (94%) in discriminating between suicidal  ideators who had made a suicide attempt (n=9) from those who had not (n=8), although the out-of-sample accuracy for the excluded 21 was only 61%. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something here, but I'm puzzled... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I commend the authors for studying a neglected clinical group, but wish they were more rigorous, didn't overinterpret their results, and didn't overhype the miracle of machine learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisistextline.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Crisis Text Line&lt;/a&gt; [741741 in the US] uses machine learning to prioritize their call load based on word usage and emojis. There is a great variety of intersectional risk factors that may lead someone to death by suicide. At present, no method can capture the full scope of diversity of who will cross the line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000; font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are feeling suicidal or know someone who might be, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsuicide.wikispaces.com/Online+Suicide+Help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a directory of online and mobile suicide help services. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I won't discuss the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;problematic&lt;/a&gt; nature of the IAT here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just MA, Pan L, Cherkassky VL, McMakin DL, Cha c, Nock MK, &amp;amp; Brent D (2017). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Machine learning of neural representations of suicide and emotion concepts identifies suicidal youth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She upset me.” Such a natural way to describe things, using the same causal language we use to talk about a racket striking a tennis ball. But is this the right way to frame our reactions to social situations? Unlike a ball, we have a say in how we swerve when struck, and what we bring to a social situation influences how it affects us. Case in point, from a US-based team headed by Andrew Woolum of the University of North Carolina Wilmington: in &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-32280-001&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/i&gt; they show how people perceive more workplace rudeness when exposed to notions of rudeness at the start of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31885&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolum’s team recruited 81 people from an executive MBA course who worked in roles ranging from security, medicine and business. The participants completed surveys twice daily for ten consecutive workdays: they recorded their mood when they woke up, and in the evening they described the experiences they’d had at work that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning survey also linked to a short video of a workplace interaction that was supposedly material for a critical thinking task. In fact, the true purpose of the videos was to vary exposure to rudeness. On half the mornings the video incorporated an act of rudeness within the interaction, such as responding to a request with a lack of eye contact and unfriendly language; on other mornings the interaction was entirely cordial. Accompanying these videos were simple puzzles where words must be unscrambled and then ordered into a sentence. On the days where participants watched a video with rudeness, the unscrambling task was set up to reinforce the rudeness concept, with sentence solutions such as “she always bothered him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolum found that on the days that participants saw an act of rudeness in the morning video, they went on to report having seen more workplace rudeness during the day. In the evening survey, they also said they felt less able to get on with their daily duties that day, described making poorer progress towards their goals, felt less ownership of their responsibilities, and avoided speaking with other co-workers, all due to that sense of being the victim of more rudeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings were as the researchers expected based on the idea that threat-related concepts, if presented during (and particularly at the beginning of) a waking cycle, activate a network of related concepts and make it easier for subsequent events to become interpreted in the context of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all participants were as susceptible to these effects as others. A few weeks before the study, participants had completed a questionnaire measure of “core self-evaluation”, which taps into multiple qualities related to confidence and emotional stability: self-esteem, self-efficacy (feeling capable), locus of control (feeling in control of one’s life) and lower neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence that this constellation of traits prevents people becoming strongly affected by threatening social stimuli, and this was borne out in the results: those one standard deviation higher in core self-evaluation were immune from the rudeness manipulation, neither perceiving more rudeness during their workday nor suffering the adverse effects that the rude video appeared to provoke in their less confident colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/11/when-and-why-does-rudeness-sometimes-spread-round-the-office/&quot;&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt; on how being the victim of rudeness can increase the chances you pass it on to others. But here we see that simply being exposed to rudeness in the abstract can sensitise you to experience it: seek and you shall find. Wooley’s team wonder if this effect may also be true of other social but ambiguous phenomena such as when people feel they have been the victim of injustice. The new findings also call to mind Scott Lilienfeld’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/16/the-scientific-evidence-for-microaggressions-is-weak-and-we-should-drop-the-term-argues-review-author/&quot;&gt;recent critique of microaggressions&lt;/a&gt; where he speculates that a propensity to feel victimised may contribute to the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a practical perspective, the findings suggest wise managers should take into account that team members lacking confidence may be especially vulnerable to a spiral of negative effects when exposed to habitual rudeness – such as when assigned a nightmare client. For all of us, the study provides a reminder that we are participants in, not merely subjects of, our social existence. That’s good news, because it gives us more say in how it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

The 'file drawer problem' is generally understood to mean &quot;the bias introduced into the scientific literature by selective publication - chiefly by a tendency to publish positive results but not to publish negative or nonconfirmatory results.&quot;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PALO ALTO CA, November 1, 2017 –&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), announced today that company CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., has been selected as an Executive of the Year finalist in the prestigious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripawards.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2017 Scrip Awards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Iorns is one of six C-level executives recognized in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Executive of the Year category for private companies or those with a market capitalization of &amp;lt;$1 billion. This awards category acknowledges excellence in the leadership of large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A cancer researcher herself, Iorns co-founded Science Exchange in 2011 to streamline R&amp;amp;D outsourcing and facilitate access to qualified, innovative scientific service providers. Because of the robust platform’s clear benefits to R&amp;amp;D organizations, she has successfully negotiated enterprise-level agreements between Science Exchange and many of the world’s top biopharma companies, as well as with numerous biotech and pharma startup incubators. Over the past year, in addition to expanding the company’s reach into other R&amp;amp;D reliant industries like agrisciences and cosmetics, Iorns led the a successful Series C venture capital funding round, bringing an additional $28 million of investment that will allow Science Exchange to accelerate its impressive growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Iorns is also the co-director of the Reproducibility Initiative, and is a part-time partner at Y Combinator. She has a Ph.D. in Cancer Biology from the Institute of Cancer Research (UK), and before starting Science Exchange was an Assistant Professor at the University of Miami, where she remains an Adjunct Professor. She has been recognized previously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as one of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “Ten People that Mattered” and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;WIRED’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “50 Women Who Are Changing The World.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Psychedelics and Drug Addiction</title>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/01/psychedelics-and-drug-addiction/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Overindulgence in anything can be intoxicating, even if it is something as essential as water. Though we all try to rationalize these things, sometimes we simply fail. Gone are the days when the word “addiction” was associated with some poorer and less educated parts of society. It is a fact that today substance abuse is equally prevalent among successful and intelligent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Psychiatric Association defines addiction as something that a person keeps indulging in despite the harmful consequences of overindulgence. The person has a compulsion or focus on taking that particular substance or practicing that particular habit. Addiction results in distorted thinking, it changes behavior and body functions. This addiction leads to changes in wiring of the brain. Addiction is also characterized by building up tolerance, meaning that a person needs higher doses with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two broad reasons for addiction, psychological and physiological. The psychological component is present in every addiction, as a person seeks and gets pleasure from his or her addiction. Some seek enjoyment, others look for stress relief. Some people even believe that addiction improves their performance, mental or physical. Physiological addiction develops when the body becomes dependent on the substance for normal functioning. For example, long time smokers have a problem with bowel movement after quitting the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, addiction can be treated, but only if a person is willing to get rid of it. After all, it has lots to do with the habit forming, pleasure-seeking nature of humans, a part of the physiological dependence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the effectiveness of addiction therapy is very low because few people sincerely wish to give up their addiction. Consciously or not, many addicts look for an excuse to continue.  Statistics show that as few as 10% of people who attempts to quit their addiction actually succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of psychedelic drugs is banned almost universally, even scientific studies on their effects are prohibited in most countries. Nonetheless, it appears that some specific properties of psychedelics can be used to successfully treat a variety of addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic here is to use one mind-altering agent to overcome dependence on another. The dose makes the poison: a poisonous compound can be an efficient medicine when used at the right dosage. Psychedelic drugs may help to cure addiction when they are used under controlled conditions and at the right dose. This is precisely what many researchers are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic drugs differ from other addictive drugs in their mind alternating properties: they alter thinking processes and perception through their action on serotonin receptors. They are known to change the level of consciousness experienced. People taking these drugs feel as if they are in a kind of trance. Some of the conventional psychedelic drugs include “magic mushroom” hallucinogens (psilocybin), LSD, and mescaline. There has been several trials and observational studies showing that these drugs are capable of altering the brain by resetting thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ibogaine&lt;/em&gt; is one such psychedelic drug that is being studied. It is a potent hallucinogen that brings various memories and experiences to the person taking it that has been traditionally used in shamanic rituals in western Africa. Many underground clinics for treatment of severe drug addiction have reported the wonderful effects of even a single dose of this plant-derived drug. But this drug is highly toxic, and many pharmaceutical companies are trying to come up with an analogue that is safe for humans, free from hallucinogenic effect, and still has potency to treat addiction. Very little is known about the mode of action of this drug. Moreover, some people in the scientific community think that only natural ibogaine will have the desired properties. Medical professionals caution against the use of this drug in underground clinics, as ibogaine is known to cause seizures and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another natural compound that shows promising results in the treatment of drug addiction and some psychiatric illnesses is &lt;em&gt;psilocybin&lt;/em&gt;, a compound found in magic mushrooms. A recent small scale proof-of-concept trial done by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, demonstrated that the drug can help lifelong smokers to quit the habit. The therapy with psilocybin worked much better than any other currently known forms of anti-smoking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, psilocybin was used to treat alcohol addiction. This study was rather specific, as only people with the most extreme cases of alcohol addiction were accepted for the trial. Though this was a small scale study, it had terrific results in overcoming the years of alcohol addiction and completely changing the outlook for the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSD is perhaps one of the best-known psychedelics. It is used as a recreational and addictive drug, although it was banned in the 1960s and 1970s in most countries around the globe. But very few people know that LSD is the most intensively tested in clinical trials for the treatment of addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the large-scale studies performed in six hospitals across Saskatchewan, Canada, more than 1000 alcoholics were treated for their addiction with LSD. The study enrolled people known to be resistant to other forms of treatment for addiction, people with broken lives, former prisoners, and people with severely damaged health. The majority of those treated with LSD were able to stay away from alcohol for quite a long time. In fact, the researchers reported a success rate of 70%. Considering the statistics and the scale of the study, this is not something to be neglected. However, due to the criminalization of LSD, it could neither be used for treatment of alcohol addiction, nor could further clinical trials could be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind that psychedelic drugs have consistently provided excellent results in the treatment of various addictions, we should probably reconsider the total ban on their use for research and medical purposes. One future direction could be the development of synthetic analogues of psychedelics with lesser side effects but similar mind-altering properties. Taking into account the growing epidemics of opioid addiction in the US, psychedelics should be seriously considered for their potential to contribute positively to the solution for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Can psychology help us avoid procrastinating and get on with the important things we know we should be doing?&lt;/strong&gt; Our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; hears about what causes procrastination, how to stop it, and whether it has any upsides. Also, we put the psychologists on the spot and ask whether they’ve managed to cure their own procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guests are the world experts in the psychology of procrastination &lt;a href=&quot;https://carleton.ca/psychology/people/timothy-a-pychyl/&quot;&gt;Professor Tim Pychyl&lt;/a&gt; at Carleton University and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/fuschia-sirois&quot;&gt;Dr Fuschia Sirois&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

 Our growing awareness of the microbial world’s importance and diversity contrasts starkly with our limited understanding of its fundamental structure. Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global context to DNA sequence data and a framework for incorporating data from future studies, fostering increasingly complete characterization of Earth’s microbial diversity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Kctd13 deletion reduces synaptic transmission via increased RhoA</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/S6y6qGdeZgc/nature24470</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Copy-number variants of chromosome 16 region 16p11.2 are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders and are among the most prevalent in autism spectrum disorders. Of many 16p11.2 genes, Kctd13 has been implicated as a major driver of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The function of KCTD13 in the mammalian brain, however, remains unknown. Here we delete the Kctd13 gene in mice and demonstrate reduced synaptic transmission. Reduced synaptic transmission correlates with increased levels of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), a KCTD13/CUL3 ubiquitin ligase substrate, and is reversed by RhoA inhibition, suggesting increased RhoA as an important mechanism. In contrast to a previous knockdown study, deletion of Kctd13 or kctd13 does not increase brain size or neurogenesis in mice or zebrafish, respectively. These findings implicate Kctd13 in the regulation of neuronal function relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and clarify the role of Kctd13 in neurogenesis and brain size. Our data also reveal a potential role for RhoA as a therapeutic target in disorders associated with KCTD13 deletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24470&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24470&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/S6y6qGdeZgc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A tethering complex drives the terminal stage of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/NqDnOsDKTAY/nature24469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             Membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells mediates the biogenesis of organelles, vesicular
                traffic between them, and exo- and endocytosis of important signalling molecules,
                such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Distinct tasks in intracellular membrane
                fusion have been assigned to conserved protein systems. Tethering proteins mediate
                the initial recognition and attachment of membranes, whereas SNARE (soluble
                N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein
                complexes are considered as the core fusion engine. SNARE complexes provide
                mechanical energy to distort membranes and drive them through a hemifusion
                intermediate towards the formation of a fusion pore. This last
                step is highly energy-demanding. Here we combine the in
                    vivo and in vitro fusion of yeast vacuoles with molecular simulations
                to show that tethering proteins are critical for overcoming the final energy barrier
                to fusion pore formation. SNAREs alone drive vacuoles only into the hemifused state.
                Tethering proteins greatly increase the volume of SNARE complexes and deform the
                site of hemifusion, which lowers the energy barrier for pore opening and provides
                the driving force. Thereby, tethering proteins assume a crucial mechanical role in
                the terminal stage of membrane fusion that is likely to be conserved at multiple
                steps of vesicular traffic. We therefore propose that SNAREs and tethering proteins
                should be considered as a single, non-dissociable device that drives fusion. The
                core fusion machinery may then be larger and more complex than previously
                thought.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Creation of forest edges has a global impact on forest vertebrates</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/jbGEjpNWzJ0/nature24457</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Forest edges influence more than half of the world’s forests and contribute to worldwide declines in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, predicting these declines is challenging in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes. Here we assembled a global dataset on species responses to fragmentation and developed a statistical approach for quantifying edge impacts in heterogeneous landscapes to quantify edge-determined changes in abundance of 1,673 vertebrate species. We show that the abundances of 85% of species are affected, either positively or negatively, by forest edges. Species that live in the centre of the forest (forest core), that were more likely to be listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reached peak abundances only at sites farther than 200–400 m from sharp high-contrast forest edges. Smaller-bodied amphibians, larger reptiles and medium-sized non-volant mammals experienced a larger reduction in suitable habitat than other forest-core species. Our results highlight the pervasive ability of forest edges to restructure ecological communities on a global scale.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Detecting evolutionary forces in language change</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/lETLdRLqdMo/nature24455</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both language and genes evolve by transmission over generations with opportunity for differential replication of forms. The understanding that gene frequencies change at random by genetic drift, even in the absence of natural selection, was a seminal advance in evolutionary biology. Stochastic drift must also occur in language as a result of randomness in how linguistic forms are copied between speakers. Here we quantify the strength of selection relative to stochastic drift in language evolution. We use time series derived from large corpora of annotated texts dating from the 12th to 21st centuries to analyse three well-known grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the introduction of the periphrastic ‘do’, and variation in verbal negation. We reject stochastic drift in favour of selection in some cases but not in others. In particular, we infer selection towards the irregular forms of some past-tense verbs, which is likely driven by changing frequencies of rhyming patterns over time. We show that stochastic drift is stronger for rare words, which may explain why rare forms are more prone to replacement than common ones. This work provides a method for testing selective theories of language change against a null model and reveals an underappreciated role for stochasticity in language evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24455&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24455&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/lETLdRLqdMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/g0BHzg5hnKc/nature24297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and complete responses. Emerging evidence implicates a key role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer ‘persister’ cells. The persister cell pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant tumours may emerge. Targeting persister cells therefore presents a therapeutic opportunity to impede tumour relapse. We previously found that cancer cells in a high mesenchymal therapy-resistant cell state are dependent on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 for survival. Here we show that a similar therapy-resistant cell state underlies the behaviour of persister cells derived from a wide range of cancers and drug treatments. Consequently, we demonstrate that persister cells acquire a dependency on GPX4. Loss of GPX4 function results in selective persister cell ferroptotic death in vitro and prevents tumour relapse in mice. These findings suggest that targeting of GPX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24297&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24297&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/g0BHzg5hnKc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Hrk408Miezs/nature24282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 For the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) assembles with general transcription factors on promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIC and PIC–core Mediator complex at nominal resolutions of 4.7 Å and 5.8 Å, respectively. The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 (a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the ‘E-bridge’ helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and shoulder in the PIC–core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the C-terminal domain of Pol II.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Nutrient co-limitation at the boundary of an oceanic gyre</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/WwSqLQQrNLk/nature24063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production exerts a fundamental control on marine food webs and the flux of carbon into the deep ocean. The extensive boundaries of the oligotrophic sub-tropical gyres collectively define the most extreme transition in ocean productivity, but little is known about nutrient limitation in these zones. Here we present the results of full-factorial nutrient amendment experiments conducted at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre. We find extensive regions in which the addition of nitrogen or iron individually resulted in no significant phytoplankton growth over 48 hours. However, the addition of both nitrogen and iron increased concentrations of chlorophyll a by up to approximately 40-fold, led to diatom proliferation, and reduced community diversity. Once nitrogen–iron co-limitation had been alleviated, the addition of cobalt or cobalt-containing vitamin B12 could further enhance chlorophyll a yields by up to threefold. Our results suggest that nitrogen–iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean, with other micronutrients also approaching co-deficiency. Such multi-nutrient limitations potentially increase phytoplankton community diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24063&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24063&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/WwSqLQQrNLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
