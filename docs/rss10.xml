	<link>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=8757</link>
	<content:encoded>Is oxytocin really the love and trust chemical? Or is it just the hype hormone? A new paper suggests that many studies of the relationship between oxytocin and behaviors such as trust have been flawed.





The paper is a meta-analysis just published by Norwegian researchers Mathias Valstad and colleagues. Valstad et al. found that the level of oxytocin in human blood, often used as a proxy measure of brain oxytocin, has no relation to central nervous system oxytocin levels under normal co</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1960s, Nobel-prize winning research shook our understanding of what it means to be a conscious entity. Epilepsy patients who’d had the thick bundle of nerves connecting their two brain hemispheres either severed or removed (as a drastic treatment for their epilepsy) responded in laboratory tasks as if they had two separate minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an unsettling idea that has appeared in psychology textbooks for decades. But dig into the original studies and you’ll find the evidence for split brains leading to split minds was mostly descriptive. Now a team of researchers led by Yair Pinto at the University of Amsterdam has conducted systematic testing of two split-brain patients over several years, specifically to find out whether the division of their brains has also separated their consciousness. In fact, the results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/140/5/1231/2951052/Split-brain-divided-perception-but-undivided?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, suggest their consciousness remains unified. It may be time to rewrite the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23371&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the original observations and the new results, it helps to revisit a little basic neurobiology. There’s a lot of cross-wiring in the brain (the formal term is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decussation&quot;&gt;decussation&lt;/a&gt;), which means that the left side of space is processed by the brain’s right hemisphere and the right side of space is processed by the left hemisphere, which in most people is also the hemisphere that controls speech. Similarly, the left arm is controlled by the right hemisphere, and the right arm by the left hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a healthy person, the two hemispheres communicate extensively across a thick bundle of neurons called the corpus callosum (there are other lesser connections) meaning information from either side of space is shared and available to your unified consciousness. Consequently, if your right hemisphere sees something in the left side of space, your left hemisphere (controlling speech) can still name it or point to it with your right arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in split brain patients with a severed or removed corpus callosum, the original reports suggested that they were unable to verbally describe anything appearing on the left side of space, nor could their right hand point to it, or point to a picture matching it, even though their right hemisphere knew what was there (it could use the left hand to point to the target or to a picture that matched it). It’s as if the patients had two separate minds: one half knew what was on one side of space even while the other half was ignorant. It wasn’t only their brains that were split, their consciousness was too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Sperry, the scientist who won the Nobel prize for this work, hinted that there were exceptions to this split-mind phenomenon, but before now no one seems to have tested the idea systematically. For the new research, Pinto and his colleagues conducted five thorough experiments with two split-brain patients. Each experiment was really a variation on the same theme. Either verbally or by pointing, the patient had to assess the position of, or identify, pictures or shapes that appeared on one side or other of a computer screen, or they had to compare shapes or pictures on either side of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were impaired: they were unable to make comparisons between shapes or pictures that appeared simultaneously on either side of space. And when identifying or localising a picture or shape on just one side of space, their accuracy varied depending on which side of the screen it appeared on – suggesting the two sides were processed separately at a perceptual level. But here’s the critical finding: regardless of whether the target shapes or pictures were located on the left or right side of space, the patients were able to report on them by any modality – by speech, with their right hand or left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, despite their brain hemispheres being largely separated, information processed by one side or other did at some stage become available at a unified conscious level, which the patients could report on verbally or act on with either arm. Pinto and his colleagues pointed out that not only does this contradict established textbook accounts of split-brain patients, but also raises problems for contemporary theories of consciousness, such as the Global Workspace theory, which is predicated on the idea that information reaches consciousness when it is broadcast across the brain hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests were conducted many years after the patients underwent their radical brain surgery so it remains possible that the original split minds phenomenon is real, but only transient. If so, the compensatory mechanisms that overcome the phenomenon remain unknown. Changes to neurosurgical practices mean that split-brain patients are rare today and few of those tested in the original research are still alive. This means time is running out to explore these fascinating questions further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that severing the cortical connections between the two brain hemispheres does not seem to lead to two independent conscious agents within one brain,” the researchers said. “This raises the intriguing possibility that even without massive communication between the cerebral hemispheres, and thus increases in modularity, unity in consciousness and responding is largely preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Examining Lingering Effects of Concussion in a Community-Wide Adolescent Population Utilizing a Case-Matched Approach</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/03/examining-lingering-effects-concussion-community-wide-adolescent-population-utilizing-case-matched-approach/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;public domain&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Helmet-brain-double-public-domain-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the rate of emergency department visits for sports and recreation related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) more than doubled in children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/get_the_facts.html&quot;&gt;In 2012, over 329,000 children and adolescents in the US have received medical treatment for TBI&lt;/a&gt;. This statistic becomes more troubling when we consider a significant number of individuals likely do not seek medical services. TBIs are clearly a public health concern and have captured the attention of the public, media, sports community, and medical healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8934&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;public domain&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8934&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Emergency-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;public domain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary to this attention, an increasing amount of literature examining the lingering effects of previous concussion(s) now exists; however, this literature frequently demonstrates mixed results. Unfortunately, the existing research also frequently contains insufficient sample sizes, lack of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, absence of case matching, and/or mixing of sexes in the groups examined. In our recent study, we attempted to address these limitations by utilizing a large sample database of over 26,000 athletes aged 10 to 19 years, extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a case match design. Participants were grouped according to sex and number of previous self-reported concussions and then case matched on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-way analysis of variance was used to examine overall differences between concussion groups on symptoms reported and scores obtained on the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT ®) neurocognitive battery composites. A between-subjects main effect was not found for any of the neurocognitive profiles (e.g., verbal memory, visual memory, and reaction time) for males or females; however, results demonstrated male participants reported significantly increased symptoms of dizziness, fogginess, concentration difficulties, and memory problems as the number of self-reported previous concussions increased. A similar trend was not found for female participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8935&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Erik Drost Flickr&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8935&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Erik-Drost-Flickr-300x254.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Erik Drost, Flickr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, our finding that male adolescents with a self-reported history of concussions are suffering from greater daily discomfort than their non-concussed peers is a cause for concern. While it is not clear why a similar trend was not observed in females, several possible explanations exist, including: male athletes are known to underreport symptoms and are less likely to be diagnosed with a concussion unless relatively severe or higher number of symptoms are present; males endorsing more symptoms may also be more likely to connect their experiences to a higher number of past concussions; males are more likely to engage in sports associated with increased violent and aggressive acts (e.g., football and wrestling); and previous research suggesting estrogen and progesterone are neuroprotective and may aid in recovery post-concussion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7925843&quot;&gt;Roof, Duvdevani, Braswell, &amp;amp; Stein, 1994&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222128&quot;&gt;Stein &amp;amp; Hoffman, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, our findings appear to contradict a significant portion of the existing literature that did not utilize stringent inclusion and exclusionary criteria, had insufficient sample sizes, and mixed sexes in the groups examined. Consequently, it becomes more likely that these studies’ findings may at least be partially explained by confounding variables (e.g., differences among males and female participants as well as psychiatric diagnoses affecting symptoms reported and neurocognitive performance). Due to the role confounding factors may be playing in the existing research’s results, we recommend use of caution when interpreting and generalizing research that utilizes a relatively lenient inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., mixing of sexes and not screening for learning disorder diagnoses and ADHD) and insufficient sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our results do not indicate lasting neurocognitive changes following concussion, it is important to note &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754723&quot;&gt;the ImPACT® may lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity to measure chronic changes in cognition&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it is also important to note that the information we analyzed was obtained by self-report. As a result, our study does not allow for an inference of causation between concussion history and persistent neurocognitive impairment or post-concussive symptoms. Despite this, our results did provide evidence of persistent negative subjective effects that correlate with number of self-reported concussions, suggesting future research in this area is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Protein–phospholipid interplay revealed with crystals of a calcium pump</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gQ3fYmG0b-k/nature22357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The lipid bilayer has so far eluded visualization by conventional crystallographic methods, severely limiting our understanding of phospholipid– and protein–phospholipid interactions. Here we describe electron density maps for crystals of Ca2+-ATPase in four different states obtained by X-ray solvent contrast modulation. These maps resolve the entire first layer of phospholipids surrounding the transmembrane helices, although less than half of them are hydrogen-bonded to protein residues. Phospholipids follow the movements of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the bilayer. Unexpectedly, the entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching. Thus, phospholipid–Arg/Lys and phospholipid–Trp interactions have distinct functional roles in the dynamics of ion pumps and, presumably, membrane proteins in general.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Dominant protection from HLA-linked autoimmunity by antigen-specific regulatory T cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/7hyB_GC5L6k/nature22329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease, is associated with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4+ T-cell self-epitope derived from the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3135–145). While HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1 allele is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that autoreactive α3135–145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture disease and, in α3135–145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, α3135–145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the α3135–145 epitope in different binding registers. HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR15 transgenic mice exhibit a conventional T-cell phenotype (Tconv) that secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice are predominantly CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing tolerogenic cytokines. HLA-DR1-induced Treg cells confer resistance to disease in HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice. HLA-DR15+ and HLA-DR1+ healthy human donors display altered α3135–145-specific T-cell antigen receptor usage, HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3− Tconv and HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3+CD25hiCD127lo Treg dominant phenotypes. Moreover, patients with Goodpasture disease display a clonally expanded α3135–145-specific CD4+ T-cell repertoire. Accordingly, we provide a mechanistic basis for the dominantly protective effect of HLA in autoimmune disease, whereby HLA polymorphism shapes the relative abundance of self-epitope specific Treg cells that leads to protection or causation of autoimmunity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Core Mediator structure at 3.4 Å extends model of transcription initiation complex</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Mediator is a multiprotein co-activator that binds the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) and regulates RNA polymerase (Pol) II. The Mediator head and middle modules form the essential core Mediator (cMed), whereas the tail and kinase modules play regulatory roles. The architecture of Mediator and its position on the PIC are known, but atomic details are limited to Mediator subcomplexes. Here we report the crystal structure of the 15-subunit cMed from Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure shows an unaltered head module, and reveals the intricate middle module, which we show is globally required for transcription. Sites of known Mediator mutations cluster at the interface between the head and middle modules, and in terminal regions of the head subunits Med6 (ref. 16) and Med17 (ref. 17) that tether the middle module. The structure led to a model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cMed that could be combined with the 3.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the core PIC (cPIC). The resulting atomic model of the cPIC–cMed complex informs on interactions of the submodules forming the middle module, called beam, knob, plank, connector, and hook. The hook is flexibly linked to Mediator by a conserved hinge and contacts the transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH) kinase that phosphorylates the carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and was recently positioned on the PIC. The hook also contains residues that crosslink to the CTD and reside in a previously described cradle. These results provide a framework for understanding Mediator function, including its role in stimulating CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Persistent neural activity maintains information that connects past and future events. Models of persistent activity often invoke reverberations within local cortical circuits, but long-range circuits could also contribute. Neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) have been shown to have selective persistent activity that instructs future actions. The ALM is connected bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and ventral anterior–lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect. Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation across multiple brain areas.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: FGF-dependent metabolic control of vascular development</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/GeDSt7V9YcE/nature22322</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Blood and lymphatic vasculatures are intimately involved in tissue oxygenation and fluid homeostasis maintenance. Assembly of these vascular networks involves sprouting, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Recent studies have suggested that changes in cellular metabolism are important to these processes. Although much is known about vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent regulation of vascular development and metabolism, little is understood about the role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in this context. Here we identify FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling as a critical regulator of vascular development. This is achieved by FGF-dependent control of c-MYC (MYC) expression that, in turn, regulates expression of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2). A decrease in HK2 levels in the absence of FGF signalling inputs results in decreased glycolysis, leading to impaired endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Pan-endothelial- and lymphatic-specific Hk2 knockouts phenocopy blood and/or lymphatic vascular defects seen in Fgfr1/Fgfr3 double mutant mice, while HK2 overexpression partly rescues the defects caused by suppression of FGF signalling. Thus, FGF-dependent regulation of endothelial glycolysis is a pivotal process in developmental and adult vascular growth and development.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Non-equivalence of Wnt and R-spondin ligands during Lgr5+ intestinal stem-cell self-renewal</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/D7IiSVmDyHs/nature22313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium—an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin ligands (RSPO1–RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4–LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and induce intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However, gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise control of tissue regeneration.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Wnt proteins modulate cell proliferation and differentiation and the self-renewal of stem cells by inducing β-catenin-dependent signalling through the Wnt receptor frizzled (FZD) and the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 to regulate cell fate decisions and the growth and repair of several tissues. The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD–LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic β-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Although interactions between the thalamus and cortex are critical for cognitive function, the exact contribution of the thalamus to these interactions remains unclear. Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the thalamus, but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show, by investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically, mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity, enabling rule-specific neural sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with this notion, broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and behavioural performance, whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves both. Overall, our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience; thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function, which is dissociable from categorical information relay, indicates that the thalamus has a much broader role in cognition than previously thought.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Whole-genome landscapes of major melanoma subtypes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/4Yzm_YOJ8B4/nature22071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Melanoma of the skin is a common cancer only in Europeans, whereas it arises in internal body surfaces (mucosal sites) and on the hands and feet (acral sites) in people throughout the world. Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PLOS ONE has issued an expression of concern after the authors of a controversial study about chronic fatigue syndrome declined to share some of their data. In an unusual move, the journal included the authors’ response to the expression of concern (EOC), in which they strongly argue against the notice, and “do not accept that it […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of stereotypes about the kind of people in different professions. Lawyers and business people are often caricatured as ruthless and self-interested, especially when compared to the kind of folk who enter professions usually seen as caring, such as nursing or psychology. To test the truth of these stereotypes, a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917302817&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; surveyed the “Dark Triad” and “Big Five” traits of hundreds of Danish students enrolled to begin studying either psychology, politics, business/economics or law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale was that by testing students’ personalities after they’d chosen their subject, but before they’d begun their studies, or careers, the researchers would uncover evidence for whether people with certain kinds of personalities are drawn to particular professions, as opposed to, or as well as, those professions shaping their personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Vedel and her colleagues found that psychology students scored “substantially” lower on Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism) than business and law students. Business/economics students scored the highest of all on the Dark Triad. Law and politics students’ scores were very similar to each other: lower than business but higher than psychology. In terms of the Big Five personality traits, psychology students scored “much higher” than the other student groups of Agreeableness and Openness and Neuroticism (replicating &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/12/the-personality-differences-between-students-studying-different-academic-subjects/&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published last year). These subject differences remained even when comparing just male students, or just female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The choice of academic major and career is a complex decision involving many different factors, but the present study suggests that personality traits are at least part of this decision process,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0015-0&quot;&gt;Rediscovery of the African wolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wolf (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster)&lt;/em&gt; is a medium-sized canid with wolf-like characters. Because its appearance resembles that of the golden jackal, specimens have long been assigned to golden jackal. Viranta and colleagues have now carried out a taxonomic investigation of the African wolf. A skull and skin taxonomy assessment revealed that &lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster&lt;/em&gt; is not a golden jackal at all, but rather a close relative of the Gray wolf&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The authors provide a thorough species description through rigorous morphological analysis and assess its distribution in Africa. They have written a blog describing their study, which can be assessed &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/19/rediscovering-african-wolf/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0183-z&quot;&gt;Investigating the ethical issues of using smart-home health technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in using smart-home technologies, that is, technologies that allow a user to control utilities and appliances remotely, is generally on the increase, including the home healthcare industry.  Ethical considerations, such as privacy, user consent, risk of social isolation and equity of access have not, however, been extensively investigated. With this in mind, Birchley &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;interviewed a number of researchers working for multi-center smart-home project and directly involved in the design and implementation of smart-home technologies. The researchers were asked to describe their own experiences of working on the project and their views on ethical considerations pertaining to the use smart-home technologies. Two ethical “themes” emerged, that of privacy and choice. Privacy concerns included possible unauthorized sharing of information and also “physical” privacy- in other words concerns about being watched or monitored. Choice focused on the challenge of balancing the end-user freedom to choose and ethical considerations that could limit these choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0388-9&quot;&gt;The pain experienced by amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported in people living with HIV/AIDS. Recent research suggests that, because many chronic pain conditions are more common in women than men, more women living with HIV/AIDS experience pain. In this study, Parker &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigated chronic pain suffered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_people&quot;&gt;amaXhosa&lt;/a&gt; women living with HIV/AIDS and whether there were associations between pain in this population and various psychosocial factors, including employment, mental health issues and health-related quality of life. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 229 amaXhosa women registered for HIV/AIDS testing at a community health center. All participants were interviewed and asked to fill in a demographic questionnaire. Almost 75% of the women included reported experiencing a significant amount of pain and only two were receiving adequate pain management. Furthermore, pain was more prevalent in those women who were unemployed and had significantly fewer years of schooling; it was also had detrimental effects of mental health and health-related quality of life. The study concludes that pain is a common problem for amaXhosa women with HIV/AIDS and that routine pain assessments could help with the  management of pain and mitigating much of its effects on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-017-0356-1&quot;&gt;Is linoleic acid the key that unlocks the quantum brain?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocchi and colleagues published a review article discussing the role of linoleic acid on the functioning of the brain. In it they describe a mechanistic model that considers subneuronal structures in the brain, such as ion channels, membrane fatty acids and the cytoskeleton, as part of a finely balanced dynamic system that are vital to a healthy brain. Subtle membrane fatty acid changes can disrupt this balance, causing, for example dysregulation of the membrane, cytoskeleton and their interface. Minor changes that lead to significant effects is known to occur in physical systems that are undergoing phase transitions (for example, where a solid changes into a liquid). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model&quot;&gt;Ising model&lt;/a&gt;, for example, undergoes a phase transition from an ordered to disordered state once a particular temperature is reached. Cocchi et al propose that the dynamic system in the brain works in a way similar to the Isling model, with very small changes in linoleic acid concentration being associated with mental health disorders such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another review article of note this month is from &lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology &lt;/em&gt;Associate Editor Asad Khan and colleagues, discussing the major worldwide concern about the emergence of carbapenemase producing bacteria, in particular New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1). NDM-1 is a metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme that is structurally dissimilar to other beta-lactamase enzymes. It was first identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from a Swedish patient who had returned from India with a urinary tract infection in 2009. It has become more prevalent in the community and in hospital settings and its markers have been identified in almost all members of the enterobacteriacae family. Khan et al provide a comprehensive view of the structural differences among NDM-1 variants, which are a driving force behind their spread across the globe. Khan also discusses his insights on the emergence of NDM-1 and its effect on bacterial antibiotic resistance in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/28/human-destiny-post-antibiotic-era/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions can be fleeting and superficial, for example imagine the split-second of anger you experience after missing the bus. But other “peak emotional states” are more powerful and they are accompanied by intense physical reactions, such as crying or “the chills”. Often these physical manifestations accompany extreme fear or sadness, but they can also occur when we admire a magnificent sunset or enjoy a beautiful piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384201/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; by Kazuma Mori and Makoto Iwanaga has taken a closer look at the contrasting psychology and physiology underlying the chills and tears many of us experience when we’re profoundly moved by a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23275&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The researchers asked a group of 154 Japanese undergraduate students to estimate how often they experienced music-induced chills or tears. For this purpose, experiencing goose bumps or shivers was defined as chills, while tears were broadly understood as weeping or feeling a lump in the throat. Participants who had reported at least one such peak emotion in response to music were assigned to the chills or tear group, depending on what they had experienced more often. There were 32 students in the chills group, and 34 in the tears group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of musical experience, such as instrument or singing classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers asked each participant to name three songs that had already elicited tears or chills in them, and these were used in the next part of the study. All songs were Japanese pop/rock with lyrics, such as &lt;em&gt;Hello Hello&lt;/em&gt; by Superfly, which elicited chills, and &lt;em&gt;This Love&lt;/em&gt; by Angela Aki, which elicited tears. To control for non-emotional effects of songs (such as increased in tempo or pitch), the experimenters also picked three musically similar control songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant then listened to their six individual songs in a sound-attenuated room while attached to psychophysiological instruments that measured their heart rate, breathing and sweating. Every time they experienced chills or tears, participants were instructed to perform a mouse click. They also gave real-time feedback on how they were feeling using a sliding scale on a computer. After each song, the participants indicated how strongly they had experienced peak emotions (tears or chills), whether these had been positive or negative and how excited or moved they were feeling. Also, they rated how the song was making them feeling in general (happy, sad, calm or fearful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study yielded some very interesting findings. For one, while all the self-picked emotional songs increased physiological arousal at first (faster heart rate, breathing and more sweating), there was a clear differentiation around the onset of peak emotion. As the researchers expected, chills were associated with increasing physiological arousal, whereas tears were associated with slower breathing and physiological calming. Contrary to the tears caused by situations of distress or grief, tears evoked by music in this study were associated with subsequent calming, with could be viewed as a release of tension. These results seem to support the idea that music-induced tears have a cathartic, relieving function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this difference in physiology, both chills and tears were experienced as pleasurable, although there were psychological differences as well. Songs that induced chills were perceived as a mix of happy and sad, while a song that evoked tears was generally considered sad. What is more, tear-inducing songs were generally rated as calmer than chills-inducing songs. Interestingly, the researchers showed that physiological changes were likely not a consequence of the musical characteristics of the songs. Rather, they suggested that physiological arousal and calming occurred as an inherent feature of whether the listener experienced chills or tears, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main limitations of this study was that chills were not assessed in the tears group and vice versa. As previous studies have suggested that chills and tears can co-occur, it remains a possibility that some sad songs triggered both chills and tears. However, this study’s finding that music-induced tears and chills seem to reflect inherently different peak emotions would seem to argue against this possibility. Another potential problem was that emotional songs were familiar to the participants, which opens the doors to possible confounding. For example, songs might trigger emotional memories, which would mean that, rather than the song, a triggered memory was causing the crying or shivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly, findings from Japan are not easily generalised to Western Europe, where emotions likely carry a different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the take-home message? The results give credit to the idea that tears, especially in moments of intense emotion in response to music, are not necessarily bad. Instead, they seem to offer relief by releasing tension, adding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; that has attempted to find out why so many of us seem to enjoy listening to sad music. It will be interesting to see if these new findings can be replicated in a Western sample.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: World Asthma Day</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/02/world-asthma-day/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;asthma words&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/asthma-words-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic disease that affects more than 235 million people worldwide. World Asthma Day was organized to address this public health issue, and to increase knowledge of the disease across the globe. Asthma causes one’s airways to become inflamed and produce extra mucus, which can result in various symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. These symptoms may emerge after being triggered by factors that cause more swelling in the airways. Some more common triggers include allergies, smoking, air pollution, dust mites, and physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The severity and cause of symptoms differs from person to person, so it’s crucial that patients are mindful of their particular condition. There is no cure for asthma, but with proper knowledge and treatment, it can be well managed. However, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 383,000 people worldwide died due to asthma complications in 2015. This year on World Asthma Day, we want to highlight some recent research about the disease and its triggers to promote appropriate management. There have been various studies published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; this year that investigate several aspects of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/department-of-medicine/cchsa/joshua-lawson.php#About&quot;&gt;Lawson &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0355-5&quot;&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to better understand how living in urban versus rural areas affects asthma in children. In order to do this, they studied children living in varying population densities, from large urban centers to small, rural towns. They found that while asthma prevalence among children tended to be lower in rural areas, the symptoms were more severe. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it could be due to certain environmental triggers or differences in disease management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asthma symptoms in the workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conditions encountered in the workplace can also trigger asthma symptoms. These are referred to as occupational exposures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0306-1&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; sought to explore the association between certain occupational exposures and asthma exacerbation. Overall, Kim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; found that the following conditions were associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbation: exposure to gas, smoke, and dust, cold temperatures, strenuous activity, and damp and moldy environments. Dampness and mold, as well as strenuous activity, specifically were associated with severe asthma exacerbation. It is important for asthmatic patients to be aware of the risks these conditions pose, and should avoid them whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep disorders and asthma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, have also been shown to negatively affect asthma symptoms. These conditions reduce airflow to the lungs which increases acid reflux and inflammation, which may ultimately worsen asthma symptoms. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0313-2&quot;&gt;recent research article&lt;/a&gt;, Han &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; studied the effects of sleeping disorders on asthma symptoms in South Korea. Sleep disorders have become increasingly common in South Korea, and asthma here is relatively not well managed. The study found that sleep disorders in patients previously diagnosed with asthma tend to worsen symptoms and increase risk of mortality. This reveals the importance of finding a proper course of treatment and being aware of the added risks of sleeping disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8921&quot; style=&quot;width: 950px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Asthma deaths in 2012&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8921 size-full&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Asthma-map.png&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Asthma deaths in 2012&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Data from World Health Organization Estimated Deaths 2012 Vector map from BlankMap-World6, compact.svg by Canuckguy et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While asthma is a major public health issue — and the most common noncommunicable disease among children — it can be controlled to live a good quality of life. One major concern is that it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. This is of particular concern in low and lower-middle income nations, where asthma-related death rates are the highest. By raising awareness on World Asthma Day, people around the world hope to address this issue to ensure asthmatic patients can properly identify and treat their symptoms. This way we can lessen the burden on not only patients, but also those close to them. If you are interested in learning  more about this disease, we encourage you to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;website for more related papers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a Gasdermin</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5KXDCviNES0/nature22393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Pyroptosis, activated by the canonical caspase-1 inflammasomes or caspase-4/5/11 by cytosolic LPS, is critical for immunity1,2,3. The caspases cleave Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in the middle linker to release autoinhibition on its Gasdermin-N domain that executes pyroptosis via the pore-forming activity4,5,6,7,8,9. GSDMD belongs to a Gasdermin family sharing the pore-forming domain4,6,10. The function and mechanism of activation for other Gasdermins are unknown. Here we show that GSDME, originally identified as DFNA5 (Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 5)11, could switch TNFα or chemotherapy drugs-induced and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis to pyroptosis. GSDME was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 in the linker, generating a GSDME-N fragment that perforated membranes for pyroptosis induction. Following chemotherapy drugs treatment, caspase-3 cleavage of GSDME determined pyroptosis in certain GSDME-expressing cancer cells. GSDME was silenced in most cancer cells but expressed in many normal tissues. Human primary cells exhibited GSDME-dependent pyroptosis upon caspase-3 activation by chemotherapy drugs. Gsdme-/- mice were protected from chemotherapy drugs-induced various tissue damages and weight loss. These findings bring an unexpected concept that caspase-3 activation can trigger necrosis through cleaving GSDME and offer new insights into cancer chemotherapy.

	<title>BMC Series blog: Our “human” destiny in the post-antibiotic era</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/28/human-destiny-post-antibiotic-era/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Flickr, cosmoflash&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Pills-in-hand-edited-cc-cosmo-flash-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme, which displays the least homology with other beta-lactamase enzymes. It was first identified in &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae &lt;/em&gt;isolated from a Swedish patient who had returned from India with a urinary tract infection in 2009. It has become more prevalent in the community and in hospital settings and its markers have been identified in almost all members of the enterobacteriacae family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicians are facing grave challenges in controlling infections caused by these newly evolved NDM-1 producing bacterial strains, as all available antibiotics are becoming ineffective due to the evolution of antibiotic resistant markers. As a result, the emergence of NDM-1 and its new variants are becoming a threat to public health. In fact, many cases of mortality and morbidity have been reported worldwide due to this problem of resistance against a wide range of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current global setting of antibiotic resistance, particularly following the discovery of NDM-1 and its variants, it has become challenging for physicians to handle infections. NDM-1 producing bacteria are not killed by any beta-lactam antibiotic and even the last resort of antibiotics, carbapenems, are becoming ineffective. NDM-1 is more dangerous because it is present on the plasmid and can hence be easily transferred among the gut microbiota, leading to resistance among the entire population of gut cells.  To add to this complexity, even the ultimate measure to control such infections, the use of colistin/polymyxin, is now facing limitations, following the discovery of the &lt;em&gt;mcr-1&lt;/em&gt; colistin resistant gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous fight between human and bacteria is persistent and ever-evolving. It has global implications, not only in terms of public health, but also in terms of the tremendous economic burden due to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics against common infections. Not only are pharmaceutical companies struggling to develop new molecules as drug candidates, but within a few years of their development, bacteria are rapidly developing resistance. Currently, a few inhibitors against b-lactamases are available in the market, which may work against b-lactamase producing “bugs”, but no inhibitor has yet been successfully developed against metallo-b-lactamases, especially for NDM-1 and its variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies have been performed to design novel inhibitors as lead molecules in order to develop future drug candidates, but overall success has yet to be attained. Researchers are exploring a range of possible molecules as better alternatives to inhibit NDM-1 producing bacteria.  Another novel approach from the realm of material science, involves the combination of nanoparticles and nano-conjugates with drug molecules, resulting in an alternative approach classified as nano-medicine. In fact, several research groups have proposed a nano-particle induced photodynamic therapy, wherein singlet oxygen production from a photosensitizer may lead to a cascade of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generation. This strategy has been proven to be effective against multidrug resistant bacterial strains, irrespective of type of resistant markers present, but it has not yet reached clinical trials. I presume that due to the nontoxic effect on the human cell line, this therapy can be approved and if so, it has to be brought to the awareness of physicians and clinicians for potential trials. Nevertheless, further improvements are necessary and effectiveness against systemic infections should become the next focus, since so far, only topical infections can be treated satisfactorily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this current scenario of emerging trends of resistance among the bacteria, what would be the destiny of human endurance on Earth?  Besides these approaches to not only control the infection, but also to regulate the spread of these markers among the population of bacteria, “infection control” could be one of the more appealing approaches. More specifically, hospital infection control needs to be strengthened in order to streamline the proper management of infections in the hospital settings, especially within neonatal intensive care units (ICU) and other ICUs. Furthermore, it is pivotal that proper hygiene and hand wash awareness are launched in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I firmly believe that any emerging resistance problem may have a solution if the research community works collaboratively and in a structured manner. There is no need to panic over the current situation of multidrug resistance spread, rather take it as challenge at all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation seems to improve the control we have over our eyes, probably because of its known beneficial effects on attentional systems in the brain. That’s according to research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810016302100?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23237&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veena Kumari and her colleagues tested 29 regular Buddhist mindfulness practitioners (they meditated at least six times per week, and had been doing this for two years or more) and 30 non-meditators on a pair of gaze control tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One involved an onscreen dot jumping from a central spot to another location, and participants had to respond by instantly shifting their gaze, not to the new location, but to a point on the screen exactly opposite that location. This is a demanding task because it requires inhibitory control to suppress the reflexive urge to glance at the target’s new location. Meditators were more consistent at making these “anti-saccades”, showing fewer sudden drops in accuracy that indicate a lapse in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another task required following a dot’s smooth movement across a screen, and meditators made fewer sudden jerky eye movements (saccades) during their tracking of this target, suggesting their eyes were locked onto it more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was a cross-sectional study design, we should beware inferring that meditation causes greater eye movement control. It’s also conceivable there were other relevant differences between the groups besides their levels of meditative practice. But the results do align with other research suggesting that cultivating mindfulness enhances the brain’s attentional systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also showed that simply being “a mindful kind of person” isn’t sufficient to deliver these benefits: non-meditator scores on a trait measure of mindfulness (measured by agreement with questionnaire items like “‘I watch my feelings without getting lost in them”) weren’t associated with ability on the gaze control tasks. However, the meditators’ scores on trait mindfulness &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have some ability to predict their gaze control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of this last finding is that meditation alters an unmeasured variable that contributes both to attentional control and to trait-like mindfulness tendencies like being non-judgmental and non-reactive. Kumari and her colleagues speculated that this variable could relate to emotional regulation or to calming of the brain’s “Default Mode Network” – a system that is more active when we’re resting and that’s associated with mind-wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parents will attest to their young children’s remarkable knack for remembering rhymes, often claiming that their children’s abilities exceed their own. Can this really be true? In nearly all other contexts, adult memory is known to be superior to that of children, for obvious reasons, including the immaturity of children’s brain development and their lack of sophisticated mnemonic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12398/abstract&quot;&gt;A small study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/em&gt; has put pre-literate four-year-olds’ memory abilities to the test, finding that they outperformed their parents, and a comparison group of young adults, in their ability to recall a previously unfamiliar short rhyme: “The Radish-nosed King”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We argue that children are better than adults at recalling verse because they exercise the skill more in order to participate in the transmission of their culture through songs and stories, poems and taunts,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23133&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have, before now, largely neglected to study children’s verbatim memory for rhymes. They’ve been more interested in whether rhyming verse can act as a memory booster for content – that is, the meaning and story conveyed by the words – rather than the words themselves.  These studies have found that rhyme tends to be a hindrance compared with straightforward prose. This might be because kids love rhymes and so focus more on the rhyming words and sounds, at the expense of the overall meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitivescience.ceu.edu/people/ildiko-kiraly-0&quot;&gt;Ildikó Király&lt;/a&gt; and her colleauges at Central European University recruited 13 parents and their 14 four-year-old children and asked the parents to read the 167-word Radish-nosed King poem and picture book to the children each night before bed for ten nights. The poem, previously unfamiliar to all participants, has the AABB rhyming scheme and was age-appropriate for the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents were told that they would be tested on their memory for the poem, the children weren’t. A comparison group of 13 university students also listened to a reading of the poem each night before bed, while looking through a version of the picture book with the text removed. They too were told that their memory of the poem would tested after the final tenth night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day after the last reading of the poem, the researchers asked the parents, children and the young adults to recall as much of the poem as they could, verbatim. On average, the children remembered nearly twice as many correct words as the adults, and made far fewer errors. The researchers also tested all the participants on the story events in the poem, and here there was no difference between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there was a further detail: the researchers had inserted one extra line at the beginning or end of the poem, consisting of a list of nonsense and irrelevant (non-rhyming) words, supposedly shouted by the king when he’s angry. This was to test the participants’ memory for non-verse content, and here again the children and adults’ performance was matched, which argues against the idea that the children’s superior memory for the verse itself was due to the adults not paying attention (if so, they should have underperformed on the random word list too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Király and her team think that young children have a superior memory for rhyming verse because rhymes aid the oral transmission of stories and songs that form such an important part of their preliterate sub-culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging a little deeper into their results, the researchers found that the children’s memory advantage over adults was especially in evidence for the rhyming words that appeared toward the end of each of the poem’s lines. It seems children, more than adults, are particularly attuned to the way that the constraints of a rhyme can act as a memory prompt, perhaps through their extensive practise with recalling rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this last finding, Király and her colleagues said the promise of verse as an educational tool might yet be restored: “if to-be-learned material is coded verbatim in a verse, with the help of rhyme as a constraining literary device, as in the alphabet song or when, say, introducing new vocabulary for animal names, children should readily retain it, perhaps better than their teachers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12398/abstract&quot;&gt;Preschoolers have better long-term memory for rhyming text than adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structural basis of CRISPR–SpyCas9 inhibition by an anti-CRISPR protein</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8sPOZZ7uAg4/nature22377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
             The CRISPR-Cas9 systems are bacterial encoded adaptive immune systems to defend against phages infection, through RNA-guided endonuclease activity of Cas9 to degrade double-stranded DNA bearing a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and complementary sequences to the guide RNA1,2,3,4,5. Recently, two anti-CRISPR proteins AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 from Listeria monocytogenes (Lmo) prophages have been identified, both of which potently inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) and LmoCas9 activity in bacteria and human cells6. However, the mechanism of AcrIIA2- or AcrIIA4-mediated Cas9 inhibition remains unknown. Here we report a crystal structure of SpyCas9 in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and AcrIIA4. Our data show that AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 interact with SpyCas9 in a sgRNA-dependent manner. The structure reveals that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpyCas9 activity through structurally mimicking PAM to occupy the PAM-interacting site in PI domain, thereby blocking SpyCas9 recognition of dsDNA substrates. AcrIIA4 further inhibits the endonuclease activity of SpyCas9 by shielding its RuvC active site. Structural comparison reveals that formation of the AcrIIA4 binding site of SpyCas9 is induced by sgRNA binding. Our study reveals the mechanism of SpyCas9 inhibition by AcrIIA4, laying a structural basis for developing &quot;off-switch&quot; tools of SpyCas9 to avoid unwanted genome edits within cells and tissues.

&lt;p&gt;Humans are infovores, hungry to discover, and nothing holds more fascination than the future. Once we looked for answers through divination, now science can forecast significant events such as the onset of certain hereditary disease. But the fact that some people choose &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;to know – even when information is accessible, and has a bearing on their lives – has encouraged scientists, including Gerd Gigerenzer and Rocio Garcia-Retamero, to try to map out the limits of our appetite for knowledge. Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/124/2/179/&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/i&gt; suggests that it is a fear of what we might discover – and wishing that we’d never known – that often drives us to deliberate ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23103&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigerenzer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and Garcia-Retamero at the University of Granada, asked nationally representative samples of participants in Germany and Spain whether they would be willing to know the date or cause of their own or their partner’s death; whether their marriage would end in divorce; as well as information relating to positive future events like knowing the gender of their unborn child, or what was in store for them under the Christmas wrapping paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas previous research with people at heightened risk of specific diseases found rates of deliberate ignorance of between 10 and 30 per cent, the rates here were far higher. Close to 90 per cent of participants said they’d prefer not to know about future negative events (this tended to generalise: a person who didn’t want to know about one negative outcome usually said they didn’t want to know about any others). Rates of deliberate ignorance were also high for positive events, but more variable – only a third of participants said they did not want to know their child’s gender, for instance, compared with three quarters preferring not to know the outcome of a football match they were watching. So wilful ignorance is commonplace, but what’s driving it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero’s suspicion is that it’s about anticipated regret: people’s fear that they may regret hearing what’s going to happen; after all, you can’t “unknow” an unwelcome fact. People susceptible to fearing regret also tend to be risk-averse: taking risks often involves seeing the repercussions of your decision, whereas ducking a gamble simply leaves you in the dark – you’ll never know what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether anticipated regret was driving deliberate ignorance, Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero asked their participants to complete classic measures of risk aversion, like choosing between the option of different sized cash sums now versus a 50 per cent chance to win 100 Euros, with preference for guaranteed lower sums corresponding to more risk aversion. Supporting their explanation, the researchers found that the participants who’d been keener to stay in deliberate ignorance were also more risk averse. This was true for positive events too, where the regret is related to the possibility of spoiling enjoyable suspense – such as asking to know the football results because the game seems lifeless but then discovering that it turned into a 3-2 nailbiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also consistent with the anticipated regret hypothesis was the finding that participants were more in favour of ignorance when events were imminent. So 13 per cent of under-35s said they would want to know about the date their partner would die, for example, but only 8 per cent of over-50s (similarly 54 per cent of the younger group said they’d want to know about life after death compared with 46 per cent of the older group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems surprising, because information about an imminent outcome is usually considered more relevant, and we tend to think of the young as uninterested in the future and living for today. But if it is regret that’s driving things, it makes more sense: a youngster discovering that they will die in their 60s, not the more typical 70s, is unlikely to be devastated by the bad news, but for a 60-year-old, this is too ugly a fact to risk knowing. The researchers also found that participants who bought more insurance policies – a real-world measure of risk avoidance – were also slightly more likely to choose deliberate ignorance for the future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a purely rational perspective, it seems surprising that so many people shy away from potentially useful information. Knowing the timing of your future demise could shape how you save for old age, for example, while learning whether an infinite existence lies beyond death would likely shape how you approach this life. But it seems many of us prefer ignorance, driven by the fear that we might regret discovering something better left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;10_1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/10_1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0900-8&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a transplanted soft coral from the Caribbean Sea (Antillogorgia bipinnata) changed its shape consistently as the corals living in the new environment. This type of manipulation known as “common garden experiments” allowed the authors to determine the adaptive value of that change that means life or death for a species across a depth gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-8891&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/2-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individual capacity is called phenotypic plasticity when the same genotype can exhibit several phenotypes due to environmental influences, and it is the equivalent of a person getting a tan after some holidays on a sunny beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many different types of skin and some people can hardly get any tan whereas others can be unrecognizable. The coral studied by Iván Calixto-Botía and Juan Sánchez from the University of the Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, is the kind that changes dramatically its tree-like shape to an extent that the extremes have even been considered as different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That observation was also published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Sánchez and collaborators ten years ago. &lt;em&gt;Antillogorgia bipinnata&lt;/em&gt; changed the size of its branches up to ten times from shallow-water down to 40 m at the Belize barrier reef but no genetic differentiation was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;9&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8892 alignright&quot; height=&quot;277&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/9-300x224.png&quot; width=&quot;371&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors since then were wondering what was the limit of such plasticity, the adaptive canvas and if that such shape transformation can lead to an isolated population at the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine scientists studying biodiversity in the tropics are always amazed by the great number of species living in the same environments. It is difficult to image a process leading to species diversification without geographic barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists like Calixto and Sánchez are betting on plasticity as the first step to speciation without geographic barriers only with some type of selective effects at the extremes. They are now tracking the footsteps of selection in the genome of the species and the effects of depth on the coral reproductive synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both authors work at La Universidad de los Andes, Colombia&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Phylogenetic ctDNA analysis depicts early stage lung cancer evolution</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/M1n6f8lWJKo/nature22364</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The early detection of relapse following primary surgery for non-small cell lung cancer and the characterization of emerging subclones seeding metastatic sites might offer new therapeutic approaches to limit tumor recurrence. The potential to non-invasively track tumor evolutionary dynamics in ctDNA of early-stage lung cancer is not established. Here we conduct a tumour-specific phylogenetic approach to ctDNA profiling in the first 100 TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study participants, including one patient co-recruited to the PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-mortem study. We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release and perform tumor volume limit of detection analyses. Through blinded profiling of post-operative plasma, we observe evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients destined to experience recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse and metastases, providing a new approach for ctDNA driven therapeutic studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22364&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature22364&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/M1n6f8lWJKo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is dispensable for commissural axon guidance</title>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/hhp_EpvSClg/nature22331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
 Netrin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, secreted extracellular matrix protein involved in axon guidance at the central nervous system midline. Netrin-1 is expressed by cells localized at the central nervous system midline, such as those of the floor plate in vertebrate embryos. Growth cone turning assays and three-dimensional gel diffusion assays have shown that netrin-1 can attract commissural axons. Loss-of-function experiments further demonstrated that commissural axon extension to the midline is severely impaired in the absence of netrin-1 (refs 3, 7, 8, 9). Together, these data have long supported a model in which commissural axons are attracted by a netrin-1 gradient diffusing from the midline. Here we selectively ablate netrin-1 expression in floor-plate cells using a Ntn1 conditional knockout mouse line. We find that hindbrain and spinal cord commissural axons develop normally in the absence of floor-plate-derived netrin-1. Furthermore, we show that netrin-1 is highly expressed by cells in the ventricular zone, which can release netrin-1 at the pial surface where it binds to commissural axons. Notably, Ntn1 deletion from the ventricular zone phenocopies commissural axon guidance defects previously described in Ntn1-knockout mice. These results show that the classical view that attraction of commissural axons is mediated by a gradient of floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is inaccurate and that netrin-1 primarily acts locally by promoting growth cone adhesion.
