	<title>Science News: Neon colors may help some corals stage a comeback from bleaching</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/corals-algae-neon-colors-bleaching-recovery-oceans</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For some
corals, going bright may be part of their fight against bleaching. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Higher-than-normal
ocean temperatures can cause some corals to bleach and lose the beneficial algae
that dwell within their cells. Those algae help feed the corals and give them
their color, so bleached corals can become bone white, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded&quot;&gt;may struggle to survive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
4/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). But when some corals bleach, they turn neon hues from red to blue
to purple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study
finds that those flashy colors may be part of a response &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30571-6&quot;&gt;that can help the corals recover&lt;/a&gt; from bleaching and reunite with
their algal partners&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s
visually very striking, but … there was surprisingly little information” on how
and why colorful bleaching happens, says Elena Bollati, a marine biologist at
the National University of Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some
researchers suspected that with the algae gone, the bleached corals’ vivid natural
colors shone through. But the new work suggests a different dynamic. In the
lab, certain wavelengths of light appear to trigger an uptick in a coral’s
production of pigments, which act as a sunscreen to create a more hospitable
home for the returning algae, Bollati and colleagues report May 21 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research
“shows that some of these corals are trying to protect themselves with really
spectacular side effects,” says Daniel Wangpraseurt, a coral reef scientist at
the University of Cambridge who was not involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A survey of
bleaching events in the world’s oceans from 2010 to 2019 revealed that some
corals’ neon colors corresponded with mild heat stress, caused by a long spell
of warmer waters or a brief temperature spike. In most cases, the colors appeared
two to three weeks after the heat stress events, says Bollati, who did the work
while at the University of Southampton in England. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Acropora corals in the Philippines&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088405&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052220_cw_coralbleach_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088405&quot;&gt;In 2010, these &lt;em&gt;Acropora&lt;/em&gt; corals in the Philippines put on a color show after water temperatures stayed slightly over the corals’ bleaching threshold for three weeks. The mild heat spell didn’t kill the corals, but later, temperatures rose further, and many corals died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088405&quot;&gt;Ryan Goehrung/Univ. of Washington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the lab,
the scientists simulated mild bleaching by exposing coral colonies to a slow
ramp up in temperature. As the team turned up the heat, the amount of algae,
detected by the red light they emit under a certain wavelength of light, in
cells plummeted. A few weeks after the heat stress, the corals bumped up their
levels of a fluorescent compound, the pigment that gives them color. The
scientists also found that an imbalance of nutrient levels could cause colorful
bleaching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After losing
their algae, an increased exposure to blue light in sunlight may play a role in
this rise in pigment production, the team found. Healthy, unbleached corals rely
on algae’s pigments to absorb some sunlight. Without the algae, more light — including its blue wavelengths — can enter and bounce around inside the corals’ skeleton
structure. That added reflection boosts the exposure of the corals’ living
tissue to light. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A
bombardment of blue light prompted bleached corals to start pumping out more of
their own protective pigments, the researchers found.  The scientists also observed that that vividly
colored areas of the corals more quickly regained their symbiotic algae than areas
with less pigment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corals “have
this capacity to fight back,” says University of Southampton marine biologist Jörg Wiedenmann, who was part of the research team. “They are
by no means doomed” after one bleaching event. But, he cautions, their
long-term survival depends on people acting to limit climate change so that
corals don’t experience more stress than they can handle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Meteorites might be more likely to strike near the equator</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorites-might-be-more-likely-strike-near-equator</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey
Evatt was snowmobiling in Antarctica when he spotted an outlandish feature. A
black rock stood so starkly against the diamantine ice that even the untrained
eye would have known it was not from this world, but a meteorite. “You’ll never
get over that high of finding the first one,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not
that it was unexpected. Before heading to Antarctica, Evatt, an applied
mathematician at the University of Manchester in England, and his colleagues calculated
where they might find the alien rocks. Two summers spent snaking up and down
their chosen spot netted 120 in total — matching their prediction and giving
them the confidence to use their calculations (plus additional ones of fireball
trajectories) to create a global tally. The results, reported online April 29
in &lt;em&gt;Geology&lt;/em&gt;, reveal that more than 17,000
impacts occur across the globe every year, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G46733.1/584575/The-spatial-flux-of-Earth-s-meteorite-falls-found&quot;&gt;majority
of meteorites hitting low latitudes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The
punchline is that if you want to go and see these fireballs streaking across
the sky, it’s best to be near the equator,” Evatt says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When
it comes to counting meteorites, though, Antarctica is an easy target. Most
meteorites collected so far have been found on the continent — thanks to the
fact that a single dark rock can be spotted easily enough against a white
background. Knowing how many impacts occurred within a specific region lets
researchers extrapolate that number to the rest of the planet, much like how
collecting rainwater in a bucket allows weather forecasters to determine how
much rain fell over a larger area.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But
Antarctica does present one major complication: The ice doesn’t remain still; it
ebbs and flows. As it moves toward the ocean, the ice carries meteorites that
fell elsewhere on the continent toward local stranding zones, eddies within the
ice. Over time that ice sublimates, turning into vapor, and reveals older,
hidden meteorites. Scientists have long collected meteorites within these
zones, but it’s impossible to know which meteorites surfed there versus which
crash-landed — and when each group arrived. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
tease out the number of meteorites that fall onto a stranding zone every year,
Evatt and colleagues calculated the ice’s movement, as well as a number of
other factors, including the rate of snow accumulation and ice sublimation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
theory, multiplying the number of crashes by the total amount of area not
covered in the study could produce a global estimate. Indeed, this is what
previous studies have done. But that method is accurate only if meteorites
strike other regions with a similar intensity. Turns out, they may not. By
incorporating orbital mechanics — how Earth’s gravity pulls in passing material
— into the calculations, the team found that meteorite rates vary drastically
by latitude. The number of strikes at the poles is roughly 65 percent of what might
be expected at the equator, the analysis indicated. (Interestingly, the global
tally still falls in line with previous estimates, albeit with much smaller
error bars.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
verify the finding, the team broke down by latitude data from NASA’s Center for
Near Earth Object Studies, or CNEOS, which records fireball events across the
globe. That analysis revealed a similar intensity trend — a peak in the rate of
meteorites at the equator with a diminished rate toward the poles. But Matthew
Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London not involved in the
study, worries that there is too little fireball data to ground the team’s
complicated calculation. In short, he argues that although the latitude trend
is certainly visible in the data, delete a few data points and it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

Chamberlin/JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CNEOS
director Paul Chodas, however, who was also not involved in the research, says
that variation in where meteorites strike makes sense. The reason is simple:
Most meteorites arrive from the asteroid belt, which circles the sun in the
same plane as Earth and is therefore positioned close to the equator. Genge
agrees that this should be the case, but he is not sure the difference should
be as extreme as what Evatt’s team reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
best path forward, Genge argues, will be to use additional fireball sightings
from NASA, along with new systems in the works to track meteorite impacts, to
see if the trend holds up.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That
data will not only reveal the best locations to look for these brilliant
streaks of light, but also the best locations to avoid them. That could help inform
where to best place such long-term survival resources as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.croptrust.org/our-work/svalbard-global-seed-vault/&quot;&gt;Global
Seed Vault&lt;/a&gt;, a storage facility built to ensure that crop seeds survive
disasters. Luckily, the bunker is already located at 78 degrees N in Norway’s
Svalbard archipelago.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ice-flow analysis could also give scientists a huge leg up when it comes to finding these solar system relics — speeding up the discovery of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorite-diamonds-hint-it-was-born-lost-planet&quot;&gt; new clues about the formation of the early solar system&lt;/a&gt; and the inner rocky planets, including our own (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/18/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: A biblical-era Israeli shrine shows signs of the earliest ritual use of marijuana</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bible-era-israel-shrine-earliest-ritual-use-marijuana</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A limestone
altar from an Iron Age shrine in Israel contains remnants of the world’s earliest
known instance of burning cannabis plants in a ritual ceremony, a new study
finds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This altar,
along with a second altar on which frankincense was burned, stood at the
entrance to a room where religious rites were presumably held inside a fortress
of the biblical kingdom of Judah. Previous analyses of recovered pottery and documented
historical events at the site indicate that the shrine was used from roughly
760 B.C. to 715 B.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excavations
at Israel’s Tel Arad site in the 1960s uncovered the shrine amid the ruins of
two fortress cities, one built atop the other, that date from the ninth century
B.C. to the early sixth century B.C. Arad, about 45 kilometers west of the Dead
Sea, guarded Judah’s southern border.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chemical
analyses of dark material on the two altars’ upper surfaces conducted in the
late 1960s proved inconclusive. Using modern laboratory devices, a team led by archaeologist
Eran Arie of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem and bioarchaeologist Dvory Namdar of Israel’s
Agricultural Research Organization – Volcani Center in Bet-Dagan analyzed
chemical components of residues on each altar. 
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03344355.2020.1732046&quot;&gt;Cannabis on the smaller of the two
altars&lt;/a&gt; had been
mixed with animal dung so it could be burned at a low temperature, likely allowing
ritual specialists to inhale the plant’s mind-altering fumes, the researchers report
online May 29 in &lt;em&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/em&gt;, a journal
published by Tel Aviv University’s Institute of Archaeology. This cannabis
sample contained enough of the plant’s psychoactive compound THC to have
induced an altered state of consciousness by breathing in its fumes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frankincense,
a form of dried tree resin, was placed on the larger altar and mixed with
animal fats that enabled burning at temperatures high enough to release the
resin’s fragrance, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biblical and
historical texts indicate that frankincense and another fragrant tree resin,
myrrh, reached the Iron Age Middle East and surrounding regions via trade from
southern Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But
cannabis is completely new for understanding incense burning in this region,
and in Judah in particular,” Arie says. Earlier evidence had pointed to the use
of other mind-bending substances, such as opium, during religious rituals in
various parts of the ancient Middle East and southwest Asia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arie suspects
cannabis plants were cultivated far from Israel, in what’s now China or
southeastern Russia. Knowledge of cannabis, or marijuana, probably spread from eastern
and central Asia to Europe along early Silk Road trade routes, says
archaeobotanist Robert Spengler of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of
Human History in Jena, Germany. Mourners at a cemetery in western China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-marijuana-smoking-rituals-ancient-western-china&quot;&gt;inhaled cannabis fumes around 2,500
years ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/12/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear
how Middle Easterners learned about and acquired potent forms of cannabis,
Spengler says. Discoveries at the Arad shrine, he says, “further complicate the
early story of cannabis.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many Iron
Age altars at Middle Eastern sites resemble the two at Tel Arad, says
archaeologist Shimon Gibson of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The
new report provides the first direct evidence that incense, sometimes including
cannabis, was burned on at least some of those altars, he suggests. “It’s
interesting to think of the priests officiating at these altars getting
‘high,’” Gibson muses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: How more powerful Pacific cyclones may be fueling global warming</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-powerful-pacific-cyclones-may-fuel-global-warming</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly powerful tropical cyclones in the North
Pacific Ocean may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax5758&quot;&gt;fueling a
powerful north-flowing ocean current&lt;/a&gt;, helping to boost the amount of heat it
ferries to northern latitudes. By enhancing the speed of some ocean whirlpools
called eddies, and suppressing the spin of others, the passing storms may be
accelerating the heat-carrying Kuroshio Current — and that could warm the
planet further, researchers report in the May 29 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long predicted that climate change would
increase the intensity of tropical cyclones around the planet. Some
observational data, including a recent study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/12/1920849117&quot;&gt;tropical
cyclone intensity&lt;/a&gt; over the last four decades, suggest that this
supercharging of storms is already happening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet tropical cyclones’ own influence on the climate isn’t
generally included in most climate simulations. The interaction of these relatively
short-lived storms with a calm, quiescent ocean has been considered
insignificant in the long-term climate picture, says Yu Zhang, a physical
oceanographer at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, in reality, the ocean is anything but quiescent, she says:
It is full of energetic eddies, large &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oceans-aswirl&quot;&gt;swirls of water&lt;/a&gt;
that spin off of large, fast-moving currents (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/9/03&lt;/em&gt;). These swirls,
known as mesoscale eddies, tend to persist for perhaps a few months, span 10 to
100 kilometers across and can extend more than 1,000 meters deep. That makes the
ephemeral eddies key players in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/following-ocean-swirls&quot;&gt;mixing up and
redistributing&lt;/a&gt; the ocean’s heat, salt and nutrient content (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/27/08&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The collision of these two giant monsters — tropical
cyclones and mesoscale eddies — will probably lead to dramatic climatic impacts
that are far beyond our imagination,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third powerful player in the North Pacific is the
Kuroshio Current, a swift, broad ocean current that originates off the east
coast of the Philippines and transports warm, tropical waters northward toward
Japan, warming the climate, nourishing rich fishing grounds and allowing the
world’s northernmost coral reefs to thrive. The Kuroshio is analogous to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-might-not-slow-ocean-circulation-much-thought&quot;&gt;North
Atlantic’s Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;, which brings warm waters and a balmy climate to
northwestern Europe (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/31/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kuroshio’s speed is primarily linked to winds.
Puzzlingly, the push of those winds has decreased in strength by more than 30
percent, on average, in the last 20 years, but the Kuroshio has not slowed as
much as would be expected, Zhang says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues suspected that changes in the spin
of ocean eddies in the region — linked to the intensification of North Pacific
tropical cyclones — were helping to keep the Kuroshio speeding along. To
investigate, the researchers used a combination of satellite data and
ocean-based Argo floats, which track temperature and salinity. The team then examined
how eddies’ energy and spinning motion, called “potential vorticity,” were
changed when the swirls interacted with a passing tropical cyclone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The storms, the team found, increased the strength of
eddies spinning counterclockwise while decreasing the strength of eddies
spinning in the opposite direction. When the eddies spin back into the current
— as they might, for example, off the coast of Taiwan — the strengthened counterclockwise
eddies, on balance, help accelerate the northward flow, the researchers say.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;phytoplankton swirl&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088433&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052820_cg_tropcyclone_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088433&quot;&gt;A swirl of phytoplankton (milky blue) outlines an ocean eddy off the eastern coast of Japan, spun off by the collision of the warm Kuroshio Current with the frigid Oyashio Current. Tropical cyclones can increase or decrease the spin of some eddies, new research shows. On balance, those changes appear to be accelerating the Kuroshio’s delivery of heat to the north.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088433&quot;&gt;N. Kuring/MODIS Ocean Color Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speeding up the Kuroshio could create a positive feedback
loop to global warming by delivering more heat to higher latitudes, helping to
warm them even more, the researchers say. That warming then could drive
stronger cyclones that could in turn speed up the current more in a continual
cycle. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar scenario, in which more powerful tropical
cyclones accelerate the Gulf Stream, is likely playing out in the North
Atlantic Ocean, Zhang adds. However, researchers are less clear about what role
climate change is playing in the intensification of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/busy-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-for-2020&quot;&gt;North
Atlantic Ocean hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;. In that region, another culprit that is supercharging
the storms is a large, natural ocean-atmospheric climate pattern known as the
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors “make a compelling case for a feedback of
tropical cyclones on global warming,” says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric
scientist at MIT. By strengthening the Kuroshio, this mechanism could, in
principle, “accelerate warming outside the tropics,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Takeyoshi Nagai, a physical oceanographer at Tokyo
University of Marine Science and Technology, notes that the study focuses on
how these eddies might be strengthening the Kuroshio in its more southerly portions.
But as the current winds to the north, nearer to Japan, the pattern of ocean
eddies becomes even more complex, and it’s less clear what impact storm-altered
eddies might have on this part of the current, he says. Better understanding of
that interplay would be especially useful, as that’s also the region where extra
heat could most affect climate and the fishing industry, by shifting, for
example, the mix of fish species. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: “Visual-Verbal Prompting” Could Make Interviews More Manageable For Autistic People</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/28/visual-verbal-prompting-could-make-interviews-more-manageable-for-autistic-people/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;Dan Carney&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key feature of interviews is open-ended questioning inviting the recall of past experiences and memories — what psychologists call “autobiographical” memory. Having to provide this information accurately and coherently, combined with the stress of the situation, can often make being interviewed a demanding and uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is especially true of autistic people, who may have difficulties with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; autobiographical memory &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; open-ended questioning. Many autistic people report job interviews as a major barrier to employment, and it’s possible that interview difficulties may also be compounding, or partially causing, problems in legal and healthcare contexts where open-ended interviews requiring autobiographical recall are a common feature. Autistic people are more likely to be involved in criminal investigations, for instance, and to experience physical and mental health difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320909174&quot;&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Jade Norris from the University of Bath has examined techniques that may help autistic people in these situations. &lt;span id=&quot;more-39687&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Thirty autistic and thirty typically developing (TD) adults were given eighteen questions asking them to recall specific life events relating to common scenarios across three contexts: criminal justice (e.g. “tell me about a specific instance when… you went to the bank”), healthcare (e.g. “…you vomited”), and employment (e.g. “…you’ve met a deadline”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes participants were also given support in the form of prompts. For some questions, they were asked for general autobiographical information before the question (&lt;em&gt;semantic prompting; &lt;/em&gt;e.g. “do you enjoy going to the cinema?”). For others, they received verbal prompting for the specific information required, alongside a pie chart displaying these prompts, after the question (&lt;em&gt;visual-verbal prompting&lt;/em&gt; (V-VP); e.g. setting, people present, actions performed). Responses were graded for specificity, with each unit of information also categorized for type (episodic vs. semantic) and relevance (relevant vs. irrelevant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the autistic group’s responses were less specific, and contained a higher proportion of irrelevant semantic information, than those of the TD group. The key finding was that V-VP was most beneficial support technique, associated with greater overall specificity, and a higher overall proportion of relevant episodic information, in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that verbal prompting may be most useful when combined with visual aids, and that this may apply to a range of interview situations. The researchers speculate that V-VP may aid the interrelated recall of information (e.g. who did what to whom, where, and when) — something autistic people can have a problem with. It may also reduce the cognitive demands of open-ended interviews, such as working out unaided exactly what — and how much — information to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic prompting was not as broadly helpful, but did benefit both groups, in the same ways, on the employment-based questions. The authors argue that this shows the importance of context: semantic prompting may be most useful in employment interviews, where it’s important to convey favourable personal characteristics, and give examples that show these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the benefits of V-VP and semantic prompting were observed in both groups implies that techniques that benefit autistic people are also more generally useful. However, the finding that autistic people’s responses were less specific and semantically relevant overall suggests that — for them — any improvements may be more meaningful, enabling them in some instances to provide sufficiently detailed and relevant information where they might not otherwise have been able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The authors also consider ways in which subsequent work could extend on this study. Firstly, they suggest that groups be matched on gender (which wasn’t done here), given that gender differences have been observed in the kind of details reported in autobiographical memories. Secondly, the authors point out that autistic and TD people may have different levels of familiarity with the situations used in the questions. A survey conducted ahead of the study found that TD individuals reported more frequent engagement with the scenarios used for the criminal justice (e.g. going to the supermarket, cinema) and employment questions (e.g. working in a team, being organized) than autistic people, with the latter group reporting more experience of the healthcare-related contexts. Norris and her colleagues suggest that future work should attempt to address how these disparities may affect recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, this is a well-designed study that offers a glimpse into how interviews may be made more manageable for both autistic and TD individuals. The findings suggest that these prompting techniques may — by reducing cognitive demand — help people provide more detailed and relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Wastewater could provide up to a week of warning for a COVID-19 spike</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring sewage for
the coronavirus’s genetic material could give public health experts up to a week of warning before
COVID-19 cases peak in an area, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found
the coronavirus’s RNA in stool from some COVID-19 patients. Though it remains unclear
whether the virus can be transmitted through feces, researchers have also
detected coronavirus RNA in raw wastewater. Because most people don’t get tested for the virus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear&quot;&gt;until
they begin to get sick&lt;/a&gt;, and some may never
develop symptoms (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/15/20&lt;/em&gt;),
researchers are considering using sewage to look for early signs that the virus
has hit a community. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Connecticut, the
amount of the virus’s genetic material in sewage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20105999v1&quot;&gt;peaked
a week before the number of cases in one region did&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in a preliminary study posted May 22 at
medRxiv.org. Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 hit their highest point three
days after RNA levels did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;From March 19 to May 1,
researchers collected sludge — which contains solids that can settle out of
water — from a wastewater treatment facility in New Haven. The team tested the
sludge for coronavirus RNA, and then compared the amount of RNA in those daily samples
with the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study “shows that we
can monitor wastewater in cities to get an early warning of when coronavirus
outbreaks will occur,” says Aaron Packman, a civil and environmental engineer
at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved with the
work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts already use wastewater to track pathogens
like poliovirus, norovirus and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Such
surveillance for the coronavirus could help pinpoint areas where cases will
soon be on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And as states begin to
loosen social distancing guidelines designed to curb the spread of the
coronavirus, samples from wastewater treatment plants, along with widespread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-u-s-contact-tracing-end-social-distancing&quot;&gt;diagnostic
testing and contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, could help experts
flag when to implement local control measures to slow the virus’ spread (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s far better to get an early warning than waiting until you have large numbers of sick people,” Packman says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Quadrivalent HPV vaccine is protective against genital warts</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/05/28/quadrivalent-hpv-vaccine-is-protective-against-genital-warts/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/vaccination-2722937_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is HPV?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infectious agent and is increasingly common in young people. HPV is linked to several cancers – especially cervical cancer – and genital warts (GW).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How high is the burden of HPV related diseases?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, a large number of women and men are affected by the anal, cervical, oropharyngeal, penile, and vaginal cancers linked to HPV. Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common malignancy among women worldwide, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/XWX.pdf?t=1589902406273&quot;&gt;with more than 300,000 deaths in 2018 alone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides cervical cancers, GWs are also common manifestations of genital HPV infection. Although usually not regarded as a serious condition, GWs cause physical symptoms such as pruritus and pain, and have a negative impact on sexual life resulting in significant loss of quality of life for those with the sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I get protection against cancers and/or genital warts?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next generation of children and young adults may not face HPV related cancer and/or GWs thanks to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The vaccine helps protect against certain types of HPV that can lead to cancer or GWs. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine targets virus types 16 and 18 – the two types that cause 80% of cervical cancer cases – and also HPV types 6 and 11, associated with 85–95% of GW cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the quadrivalent HPV vaccine effective?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08753-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our study published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the available data assessing the real-world impact of publicly funded quadrivalent HPV vaccination from the beginnings up to the 13th of January 2020. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether quadrivalent HPV vaccine has any effects in the prevention of GWs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were included where HPV vaccines (3 doses) or placebos were administered to females or males (in one study) and then the number of GW cases was compared between the vaccinated and placebo group. Eight time trend studies were also included to assess the population-level effect of the quadrivalent HPV vaccination by comparing the prevalence of GWs between the pre- and post-vaccination periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs. In the post-vaccination period, the number of GW events in women was considerably lower. Although young men were not vaccinated, the number of GW cases was also reduced among them, to be attributed most likely to the indirect protection provided by the vaccination of women. Subgroup analysis showed that GWs were reduced more substantially in those under 21 years of age than in older persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25744474/&quot;&gt;The findings are consistent with previous reviews and meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt;, where it was also found that the prevalence of GWs decreased significantly in vaccinated girls and the quadrivalent prophylactic vaccination could prevent HPV infection both in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where has the quadrivalent HPV vaccine been introduced?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardasil® has been the vaccine of choice worldwide. It has been chosen by health authorities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden for regional or national vaccination programs. In Australia, cases of GW have nearly disappeared since 2007 – this was the year when the national vaccination program against cervical cancer using the quadrivalent vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21970896/&quot;&gt;was introduced as a school based program for 12- and 13-year-old girls&lt;/a&gt;. By October 2019, 98 countries introduced HPV vaccines through national immunization programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meta-analysis gives strong evidence for the effectiveness of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Such knowledge can help governments with making decisions about the implementation of the vaccination in their countries for young females and also males, preferably through school-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: SpaceX’s astronaut launch will mark a milestone for commercial spaceflight</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spacex-nasa-astronaut-launch-milestone-commercial-spaceflight</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, humans are
poised to hurtle into Earth’s orbit on a commercial rocket.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft is set to launch at 3:22 p.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on May 30, to take U.S. astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS). The launch was originally scheduled for May 27, but was scrubbed due to bad weather less than 17 minutes before lift-off time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronauts have not launched
to orbit from the United States since 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-bye-shuttle&quot;&gt;when NASA’s space shuttle program ended&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/3/11&lt;/em&gt;). Since then, the Russian Soyuz
spacecraft have been the only way for astronauts of any nationality to reach
the ISS. (The Chinese space agency has its own rockets and crew vehicles, and
had its own space station for a time, but is not a partner in the ISS.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch will mark an
important transition in crewed space travel for NASA, shifting the government space
agency from having complete control over U.S. launches to being just another
customer of a private space flight company. That shift should end the U.S.
space agency’s reliance on Russia, though, and free NASA to focus on more
complicated missions, such as sending humans to the moon and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The reason you have NASA is
to push the envelope, do things at the frontier,” says astrophysicist Jonathan
McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
“Low-Earth orbit and the space station are no longer the frontier. So you just
hire a trucking company.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2014, NASA partnered with
private companies SpaceX and Boeing to develop new flight technology to bring
astronauts into orbit and back. SpaceX is also working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/spacex-just-launched-its-biggest-rocket-first-time&quot;&gt;heavy lift rocket&lt;/a&gt; that may eventually be capable of taking humans to Mars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/6/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this shift is
a natural evolution, McDowell says. NASA has hired private companies, including
SpaceX, to launch satellites for years, and private manufacturing has been part
of spacecraft development since the 1950s. But human space exploration has
higher stakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It has a much higher public
profile, and much worse consequences, if things go wrong. So NASA has been
understandably reluctant to take its hands off the wheel,” McDowell says. “It
has been a big attitude shift within NASA to get this far. But I think it is
the right time to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA provided funding and
technical oversight to SpaceX in the development of the Crew Dragon. “What
we’re doing is unlike anything we’ve done before,” NASA administrator Jim
Bridenstine said in a NASA TV broadcast May 27. “We are not purchasing, owning
and operating the hardware, we’re turning to commercial industry…. We’re really
revolutionizing how we do spaceflight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financially, this was a good
deal for the agency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2020/nasas-commercial-crew-is-a-great-deal-for-the-agency.html&quot;&gt;according to an analysis by the Planetary Society&lt;/a&gt; published May 19. NASA’s portion of the Crew Dragon
development came to about $1.7 billion over the last nine years, far cheaper
than every other crewed spacecraft project in the space agency’s history. For
instance, NASA spent $2.7 billion (adjusted for inflation) developing the
Mercury spacecraft, the first human spaceflight program in the United States, from
1959 to 1961. The development of the space shuttle program cost $24.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the planned launch, SpaceX
and NASA ran the Crew Dragon spacecraft through a battery of tests, especially
of the thruster system. An accident involving that system destroyed an uncrewed
Dragon spacecraft in April 2019, pushing back the planned launch schedule. That
explosion was likely caused by a propellant leak.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preflight testing also included
flight simulations for the astronauts and 27 tests of the parachute system,
used to help the capsule carrying returning astronauts back to Earth set down
safely. That’s fewer parachute tests than normal, NASA associate administrator
Steve Jurczyk said in a May 22 news briefing. But he has “high confidence that
they will function as we need them to when Bob and Doug return.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Crew Dragon’s parachute test&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088411&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052620_lg_spacex_inline2_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088411&quot;&gt;On May 1, SpaceX tested the Crew Dragon’s parachutes. It was the 27th test of the system, which will help the capsule make a safe landing when it brings astronauts back from the space station. While this test was over land, SpaceX expects to bring the spacecraft down in the ocean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088411&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Called Demo-2, the planned May 30 launch and flight will be the ultimate test of the spacecraft’s systems and its ability to ferry a crew into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This mission has a neat
resonance for the astronauts, who have both flown on two space shuttle missions
— and especially for Hurley, who was on the final flight of the space shuttle
in July of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great honor to be
part of this mission,” Hurley said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uab-trHm9ms&quot;&gt;May
1 news briefing&lt;/a&gt;. His excitement is
tempered by a sense of responsibility. “You just want to be methodical about
everything you do,” he said. “This is the first flight of a vehicle, and we
want to make sure we’ve chased down everything we need to.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hurley and Behnken spent the
two weeks before launch in quarantine to ensure that they don’t bring any
infections or illnesses to the ISS, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;the new coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. That’s standard practice that was in place before the spread of COVID-19,
says NASA spokesperson Stephanie Schierholz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA adhered to
recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on
infection control for the coronavirus before the astronauts went into
quarantine, she adds. That included “cleaning of surfaces, social distancing,
emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay
home and limiting contact with crew members.” The astronauts have also been
tested at least twice for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA maintains a pharmacy
onboard the space station, and has plans in place to sequester astronauts from
their crewmates if anyone does get sick. There are no plans to send coronavirus
tests to the space station. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic
also means that the Kennedy Space Center is closed to the general public. But before
the May 27 launch was scrubbed, crowds had gathered along nearby beaches and
roads to watch the lift-off. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once in orbit, the astronauts
will test the spacecraft’s environmental control systems, the displays and the
maneuvering thrusters. The spacecraft is designed to dock with the space
station automatically, but the crew can take over manually if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If all goes to schedule, the
astronauts will reach the space station on the morning of May 31. The mission
won’t be considered over until the astronauts return in the same Crew Dragon
capsule after a yet-to-be-determined amount of time, probably between one and
three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the craft is certified
to be safe and operational, Crew Dragons will carry up to four astronauts to
the ISS at a time on NASA missions. NASA hopes that the new transportation will
help boost human presence on the ISS, and continue research that can be done only
in space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For his part, Behnken is
excited to be launching from the Florida coast again, which was routine when he
and Hurley joined the NASA astronaut corps in 2000. “Generations of people, who
maybe didn’t get a chance to see a space shuttle launch, getting a chance again
to see human spaceflight from our own backyard, if you will, is pretty exciting
to be a part of,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Half the universe’s ordinary matter was missing — and may have been found</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At long last, all of the universe’s ordinary
matter seems to be present and accounted for. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have taken a new census of
matter in the universe by examining how bright flashes of radio waves from
other galaxies, called fast radio bursts, are distorted by particles on their
way to Earth. This analysis shows that about half of the universe’s ordinary
matter, which has eluded detection for decades, is lurking in intergalactic
space, researchers report online May 27 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mystery of the missing matter has
vexed cosmologists for some 20 years. This elusive material isn’t the invisible,
unidentified dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the universe. It’s
ordinary matter, composed of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-cosmic-web-give-matter-its-hiding&quot;&gt;garden-variety particles called baryons&lt;/a&gt;, such as protons and neutrons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/11/17&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observations of light emitted when the
universe was young indicate that baryons should make up roughly 5 percent of
all the mass and energy in the cosmos. But in the modern universe, all the
matter that astronomers can easily see, like the stars and gas in galaxies,
adds up to only about half of the expected amount of matter. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected the
missing matter is hiding between galaxies, along filaments of gas strung
between galaxy clusters in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/filament-cosmic-web-set-aglow?mode=pick&amp;amp;context=138&quot;&gt;a vast cosmic web&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/20/14&lt;/em&gt;).
“But we haven’t been able to detect it very well, because it’s really, really
diffuse, and it’s not shining brightly,” says Jason Hessels, an astrophysicist
at the University of Amsterdam not involved in the new work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some intergalactic matter is detectable by how it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-find-evidence-missing-matter&quot;&gt;absorbs the light of distant, bright objects called quasars&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/25/02&lt;/em&gt;). But the only way to take inventory all of the baryons hanging out in intergalactic space relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fast-radio-burst-steady-beat&quot;&gt;mysterious blasts of radio waves&lt;/a&gt; from other galaxies, possibly generated by energetic activity around neutron stars or black holes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/7/20)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though no one knows what causes
these blasts, called fast radio bursts or FRBs, they can make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals&quot;&gt;useful baryon detectors&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
7/25/14&lt;/em&gt;). A burst’s high-frequency, high-energy radio waves zip through
intergalactic matter faster than its low-frequency waves. The more
intergalactic matter that a radio burst’s waves pass through, the farther its
lower-frequency waves fall behind — creating a detectable smear in the radio
signal by the time it reaches Earth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist J. Xavier Prochaska of the
University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues examined five fast radio
bursts from five galaxies, all detected by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/telescopes-tracked-fast-radio-burst-faraway-galaxy&quot;&gt;Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/19&lt;/em&gt;). For each FRB, the researchers compared the
arrival times of radio waves of different frequencies to tally up the number of
baryons that the burst encountered on its journey through intergalactic space. Then,
using the distance between the FRB’s host galaxy and the Milky Way, Prochaska’s
team could calculate the baryon density along that path. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; Bright blasts of radio waves from other galaxies, called fast radio bursts or FRBs, have helped astronomers find previously undetectable ordinary matter. FRBs make good matter detectors because radio waves are affected by the particles they encounter as they cross the universe. Although radio waves all travel at the same speed through empty space, higher-frequency waves (shown in purple) zip through intergalactic matter faster than lower-frequency waves (shown in red). By measuring when radio waves of different frequencies arrive on Earth, astronomers can figure out how many particles of matter the FRB encountered on its journey through the cosmos. That has allowed them to identify matter in the shadowy regions between galaxies that was previously considered missing.   &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average density of matter between the
Milky Way and each of the five FRB host galaxies came out to about one baryon per
cubic meter. The material in the Milky Way is about 1 million times as dense as
that, Prochaska says, making the intergalactic stuff “a very wispy medium.” But
all that wispy material, taken together, is enough to account for all the
universe’s missing matter — bringing ordinary matter up to about 5 percent of
the modern universe’s overall matter and energy, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist J. Michael Shull of the
University of Colorado Boulder cautions that “five is an awfully small number”
of FRB observations from which to draw conclusions about the number of baryons throughout
the modern universe. But “once they get their error bars beaten down with many,
many more bursts … I think that will really be the nail in the coffin on this
baryon problem,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using more fast radio bursts as cosmic weigh
stations will also be useful for pinpointing exactly where all the matter in
the universe is located, says Shami Chatterjee, a radio astronomer at Cornell
University not involved in the work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, all the researchers can say about
the lost-and-found matter is that it’s between galaxies. But with thousands of
FRB observations, astronomers could start teasing out the slight variations in baryon
density along the sight lines between the Milky Way and other galaxies to map
out the cosmic web, Chatterjee says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In April 2014 the UK government launched the ‘NHS Visitor and Migrant Cost Recovery Programme Implementation Plan’ which set out a series of policy changes to recoup costs from ‘chargeable’ (largely non-UK born) patients. In England alone roughly 75% of all diagnoses of Tuberculosis (TB) will be made in people born abroad. Because of this, the authors of this manuscript set out to assess the impact of the Cost Recovery Programme (CRP) on the quality of healthcare received by those not eligible for free NHS healthcare. Utilizing a dataset of 2237 diagnosed TB cases the authors found that median time-to-treatment after the introduction of the CRP increased by 20 days from 69 to 89 days for non-UK patients. They also found a significant change in the number of years migrant patients had been living in the UK before diagnosis. Rising from 10 years pre-CRP to 14.8 years post CRP. With delays in the diagnosis of TB increasing morbidity and mortality it is imperative that diagnosis is made as early as possible. With direct significant relationships between the introduction of the CRP and an increase in time-to-treatment the authors argue that restricting healthcare access for non-UK populations undermines national efforts to eliminate TB and conclude that governments have a “moral and legal obligation” to uphold the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all people, no matter their immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 should be characterized as a pandemic. Since then we have witnessed the devastating and unpredictable spread of COVID-19 globally resulting in unprecedented lockdowns on a global scale. Aside from the increased burden on healthcare systems and the devastating humanitarian loss, researchers are now facing significant challenges in appropriately conducting statistical analyses of COVID-19 data to meet the WHO goal of evaluating “as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive and supportive therapies”. With appropriate statistical models playing a major role in “fighting panic with information” to reduce or eliminate the risk of bias across clinical and epidemiological studies the Guest Editors of this collection describe the most striking challenges experienced by statisticians and data analysts alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a continuing global health problem and can lead to serious maternal and neonatal/foetal complications. More recently the introduction of information and communication technology in healthcare has resulted in new technical support for the treatment of GDM. In this study the authors conduct a meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of telemedicine (health services and medical activities provided by healthcare professionals through remote communication technologies) for the management of women with GDM. Identifying a total of 32 Randomized control trials and a total of 5108 patients the authors found that the use of telemedicine had significant improvements in GDM measures as compared to the standard care group. They also identified that the use of telemedicine lowered indices of cesarean section, neonatal hypoglycemia, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth and neonatal asphyxia, amongst others. The authors conclude that use of communication technology and telemedicine had significant positive effects on the control of GDM and also significantly reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal/fetal complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Octopus vulgaris&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most iconic species of neurobiology research. This is mainly attributed to its reputation as one of the most intelligent studied invertebrates, possessing both long and short term memory capability and a striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. However, given the high level of parental care required for successful spawning of offspring, laboratory research and experimental populations have been notoriously difficult to maintain. In this study the authors present a novel option for a parameter-controlled artificial seawater standalone egg incubation system that has the ability to replace the significant level of maternal care required, allowing the successful embryonic development of small-egged octopus species under laboratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than half of all adults reporting having experienced neck and shoulder pain it has become the second most common musculoskeletal disorder. Unsurprisingly it is most common amongst office workers who perform low intensity, but continuous movements as part of their role. Previous research has identified a relationship between resistance training and pain relief, but none have come to a consensus on the best resistance training frequency. Thus, the authors here set out to test which dose of resistance training achieved the greatest reduction in pain. Using a cohort of 27 individuals the authors imposed two interventional routines. One cohort completed one 10 minute session daily, 5 days per week and the other completed two 10 minutes sessions daily, 5 days per week. The authors found no difference between the two interventions, finding instead that any bout of high intensity resistance training significantly reduced levels of workplace related pain and improved the quality of life of office workers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a US-based study &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/802291&quot;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that people with hearing loss were more likely to develop dementia. This alarming result prompted a number of follow-up studies, which have &lt;a href=&quot;https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.11.004&quot;&gt;substantiated the link&lt;/a&gt; and further &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eneuro.org/content/5/3/ENEURO.0263-17.2018&quot;&gt;explored the risk&lt;/a&gt;. But the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; hearing loss raises this risk has not been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa061/5810460&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, by a team at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, offers an explanation. The researchers found that gradual hearing loss (the sort commonly experienced into older age) “profoundly” alters normal processes in the brain’s cortex and hippocampus, and that this impairs memory. This work was conducted on mice, not humans. But it provides useful new insights into what might happen in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39675&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sudden sensory loss is known to trigger widespread reorganisation of key brain areas. This “cortical plasticity” is an adaptive way of dealing with a challenge. If someone suddenly loses their vision, for example, areas of the cortex that were dedicated to vision can switch to processing touch and hearing data, enhancing these senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information from our senses plays a big part in the formation of our memories, so we have strong links between the sensory cortices and the hippocampus, our most important memory structure. The sudden loss of a sense can therefore also produce disruptive changes in the hippocampus — and memory impairments. Eventually, though, this settles, limiting the disruption to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gradual deterioration is different, though. Typical age-related hearing loss starts with impairments in hearing higher frequencies, then mid-range frequencies, then low frequencies. “During cumulative hearing loss, a steady state in terms of sensory input is not achieved,” comments senior author Denise Manahan-Vaughan. “Rather the brain has to constantly adapt to an ever-changing sensory input.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, led by Daniela Beckmann, the team used a strain of mice that serve as a model for typical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Content%2520Images/presbycusis.pdf&quot;&gt;gradual hearing loss in older people&lt;/a&gt;. To look at how this hearing loss might reorganise the brain, the researchers examined changes in the animals’ neurotransmitter receptors, a key part of the chemical messaging system that allows for healthy communication between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that progressive hearing loss caused a reorganisation of brain areas, with neurotransmitter receptor changes taking place in both sensory-processing regions in the cortex and the hippocampus. This process also impaired cellular processes related to memory that take place in the hippocampus, and the mice developed clear deficits in spatial memory (their memory for where they’ve been and the layout of their environment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This constant change in the mice’s neurotransmitter receptor expression during cumulative hearing loss uses up tremendous resources, says Manahan-Vaughan. Not only do memory structures receive less sensory information — because hearing is becoming impaired — but also the information that these structures receive from the cortex constantly changes (with the progression from high-frequency through to low-frequency loss). “This is very likely why memory becomes impaired,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this process is mirrored in the human brain, hearing loss may, then, amplify or accelerate deficits in cognition caused by the degeneration of brain cells with older age. As the researchers write, “our results suggest that age-related hearing loss may be a contributor to loss of function in the hippocampus that occurs with age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process does not itself &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; Alzheimer’s disease (or vascular dementia, which is also relatively common). But in acting as such a drain on the brain’s resources, and interfering with memory, hearing loss could make it much harder for the brain to cope with another challenge — such as the protein plaques and tangles that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. And this has practical implications, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think my study shows that it is extremely important to start wearing a hearing aid when hearing loss becomes apparent,” says Manahan-Vaughan. “I wouldn’t go so far as to say this will prevent dementia — this is another physiological process entirely — but wearing a hearing aid is likely to slow down the progress of memory impairments that occur in healthy ageing, simply because one reduces the demands on the brain to adapt to the progressive loss of a sensory modality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa061/5810460&quot;&gt;Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity, Spatial Memory, and Neurotransmitter Receptor Expression Are Profoundly Altered by Gradual Loss of Hearing Ability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about the paper &quot;On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant movements.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Infecting people with COVID-19 could speed vaccine trials. Is it worth it?</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-human-challenge-trial-infect-people-vaccine</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The world waits with bated breath for a COVID-19 vaccine, which could effectively end the pandemic once it’s widely available. Until then, more people will die from the disease, and economies will struggle to fully recover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With such intense pressure
to get a vaccine quickly, many experts are contemplating a controversial shortcut
to the usual vaccine testing protocol: human challenge trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of vaccinating
hundreds to thousands of people and waiting to see if they naturally catch the
virus, scientists would purposely infect a smaller number of vaccinated volunteers
with COVID-19 in a controlled setting to see if a vaccine offered protection.
If successful, such studies could fast-track vaccine evaluation, as well as our
understanding of COVID-19 immunity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, doctors and
researchers don’t all agree on whether it’s ethical to infect people with a
disease that remains poorly understood, and for which there is currently no
reliable treatment. That leaves it to those bioethicists, researchers and
regulators to weigh the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If scientists stick to the
usual playbook, a licensed vaccine is at least 12 to 18 months away, experts
say. That’s not because it takes long to develop possible vaccines — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-accelerated-vaccines-treatments-drugs&quot;&gt;dozens are already in the testing stage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/20/20&lt;/em&gt;) — but because of the time that it
takes to be sure a vaccine is safe and actually works. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final and most involved
stage of this process, Phase III clinical trials, requires thousands of volunteers
to get the vaccine or a placebo. Then, scientists track them over months to see
whether vaccinated people are less likely to get sick compared with
unvaccinated people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it could take longer now
that lockdowns and social distancing have flattened the curve of new cases.
“You can only test vaccine efficacy if incidence [of the disease] is high
enough,” says Helen McShane, a vaccine biologist at the University of Oxford.
The less the disease is spreading, the longer traditional Phase III trials will
take.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Challenge trials might shave
months off the process. “Human challenge trials have been done for hundreds of
years,” says Seema Shah, a bioethicist at Northwestern University Medical
School in Chicago. “They come with a lot of promise, but also with serious
ethical concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, in 1796, English
physician Edward Jenner, an earlier popularizer of vaccination, demonstrated
that inoculation with cowpox worked as a vaccine against smallpox by injecting
his gardener’s 8-year-old son with cowpox and then exposing him to the disease.
“Clearly, that’s problematic,” Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote has-text-align-left&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;  “ Human challenge trials have been done for hundreds of years. They come with a lot of promise, but also with serious ethical concerns. ”    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt; &lt;em&gt;Seema Shah, bioethicist at Northwestern University Medical School &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, challenge trials
are typically done on diseases about which scientists know a lot, and for which
there are numerous treatment options, such as influenza or malaria. But there’s
currently no established drug safety net for COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment&quot;&gt;though some drugs show promise&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/20&lt;/em&gt;).
And much still remains unknown about the virus, including all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor&quot;&gt;risk factors for severe disease&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/22/20&lt;/em&gt;).
Consequently, most advocates are calling for such trials to be done only on
young and healthy volunteers, who seem least at risk for serious illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers,
clinicians, bioethicists and policymakers are debating the ultimate utility of
human challenge trials for COVID-19. The ethical calculus could change as we
learn more about the virus and continue developing treatments, but some experts
are already putting out rough plans for how to minimize risk to participants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are two perspectives on
the issue, from scientists weighing both the risks and potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Human challenge trials could help us have a vaccine quicker and save lives.&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We face a worldwide
epidemic with a high mortality, and the only thing likely to stop it is vaccination,”
says Stanley Plotkin, a vaccine developer at the University of Pennsylvania.
Human challenge trials have the potential to get us an effective vaccine sooner
and thus save lives, Plotkin says, and we should start planning how to do them
ethically now. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Stanley Plotkin&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088356&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2052220_jl_trial_inline1-454x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088356&quot;&gt;Stanley Plotkin, a vaccine developer at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a COVID-19 vaccine could be accelerated by purposefully infecting humans with the coronavirus in what’s known as a human challenge trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088356&quot;&gt;S. Plotkin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would, of course, not
want to subject anyone to harm, but the fact is that harm is accumulating all
over now, and if we can reduce the total amount of harm, I think it’s worth
doing,” Plotkin says. “Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human challenge trials could
help scientists answer important unknowns about the virus more quickly than
animal studies can, Plotkin says. “A human challenge trial could tell us
whether prior infection is protective or not, as well as what sort of immune
responses are protective,” Plotkin says. “Both of those have very large
implications in terms of whether people with prior infection could take care of
the sick,” as well as our ability to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates
outside of challenge trials. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plotkin acknowledges the
potential risks to participants. “Giving someone an infection can cause serious
harm,” he says, “but the usual way of doing things also means that many people
will become ill and possibly die.” To minimize risk, Plotkin says such trials
should only be carried out on young, healthy people who understand the risks
and give their full consent. “There are thousands of people willing to be
volunteers for such studies on moral grounds, with knowledge of the risks.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A vaccine shown to work in a
challenge trial on young people may not work in older people, or may be less
effective, Plotkin says. “But a challenge trial could allow us to more easily
determine whether the immune responses we see in younger people are also seen
in older people,” who get the experimental vaccine but aren’t subjected to a
challenge virus. Even if the vaccine only worked in younger folks, “that could
still protect older people simply because they wouldn’t be getting infected by
younger [vaccinated] people,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some have &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/11/1752/5814216&quot;&gt;argued that challenge trials could replace Phase III
clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, Plotkin doesn’t see
human challenge trials as a full substitute for normal safety trials. He also doesn’t
expect them to result in regulators licensing a vaccine for widespread use.
“But it could allow for emergency use among high-risk people or health care
workers,” he says. “It could also help us determine which vaccine candidates
show signs of working,” which could allow manufacturers to get a potentially
lifesaving head start on mass production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not an exclusive
pathway,” he says, “it’s a supplementary pathway to try to speed things up.” If
normal vaccine trials revealed a candidate, or we learn more about the risks to
volunteers, Plotkin says challenge trials should be stopped. “But if we don’t
start planning human challenges now, they won’t be available if we decide
months from now that it would’ve been a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Human challenge trials are too risky, and may not end up being that helpful. &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I still haven’t been
persuaded that a human challenge trial would be informative enough to make a
final decision about which vaccine is the right vaccine to roll out at scale,”
says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of any human
challenge trial is fully informed consent from participants. But Rasmussen
questions whether that’s possible at this stage. “I don’t know that we can
actually inform them of all the risks because there’s still so much that’s just
unknown about this virus,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Angela Rasmussen&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088355&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2052220_jl_trial_inline2-490x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088355&quot;&gt;Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, says that there’s still too much we don’t know about the coronavirus behind COVID-19 to purposefully infect the virus into humans to speed along research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088355&quot;&gt;A. Rasmussen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that
young, healthy people are least likely to suffer severely from COVID-19
infection, but “we’re still learning about different types of disease that it
may cause,” Rasmussen says. Reports of young people suffering strokes, and
taking damage to the kidneys, heart and other organs have emerged in recent
months, making it difficult to quantify the actual risks. “I just don’t see how
a subject could provide their fully informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accepting those risks may result
in more harm than good, Rasmussen says. By design, any COVID-19 challenge trial
would be done on a small, homogenous group. That could limit its broader
applicability, she says, and “could miss issues with the vaccine that can only
be caught in a larger, more diverse study population.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She points to previous
examples, like the mid-2000s HIV vaccine candidate that actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/206/2/258/2192783&quot;&gt;increased risk of HIV infection&lt;/a&gt; in those who got the vaccine, or a “SARS classic”
study in which older vaccinated mice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimmunol.org/content/181/9/6337&quot;&gt;experienced
more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; after being
infected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My concern is that you
could have a major safety issue like that if you are doing only human challenge
trials in young, healthy volunteers,” Rasmussen says. A robust response in
young people could mask harmful effects that emerge in older people or a
different population, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a challenge trial
could identify promising vaccine candidates more quickly, it might also prop up
the wrong one based on limited results. If serious issues come up for other
populations, the consequences could be dire, Rasmussen says. “And we’d have wasted
resources that could have been devoted to standard Phase II and III trials.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other unknowns limit a
challenge trial’s potential utility, too, Rasmussen says. “We don’t know the
infectious dose for COVID-19,” she says, meaning the amount of virus that someone
must get to kick-start an infection. If a challenge trial got the dose or route
of infection wrong, it might not be comparable to pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, the
virus that causes COVID-19. “A vaccine would appear to work under those
conditions, but it might not be applicable to how people actually need to be
protected in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen doesn’t rule out
that challenge trials could be helpful. “It’s important to keep an open mind
about anything that can speed our way to a vaccine, but we need to be cautious
and be humble,” Rasmussen says. “There’s a lot more we don’t know about this
virus than what we do know. If a human challenge trial goes wrong, it could go
catastrophically wrong, which could ultimately be harmful for all vaccine
development efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Who decides?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exactly who gives the green light for a COVID-19
challenge trial remains unclear. Normally the decision to proceed with such a trial
lies with the funder of the research (the U.S. National Institutes of Health,
for example) and ethics boards at the research institutions or regions where
the study will be done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But given the extraordinary nature of the current
situation, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/Human_challenge_Trials_IK_final.pdf&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/15/science.abc5312&quot;&gt;leaders of the NIH&lt;/a&gt;, have called for an additional layer of review for any
COVID-19 challenge trials, which could include an independent panel of
ethicists, clinical trial researchers and vaccine development experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Food and Drug
Administration would license a vaccine for widespread use, and they would have
to decide whether results of a human challenge study would weigh on their
ultimate decision. It’s not a given that the agency would take those results
into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people are already volunteering to take part in COVID-19 human challenge trials, were they to happen. Already, over 20,000 people around the world have expressed interest in participating in COVID-19 challenge trials through “&lt;a href=&quot;https://1daysooner.org/&quot;&gt;1 Day Sooner&lt;/a&gt;,” a campaign to collect volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Toddlers might not be potty trained yet, but they know how to switch from one app to the other, Facetime their grandparents and even change WiFi networks. Researchers are still unsure as to what effects this precocious use of technology, particularly increased use of the internet, will have on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11908 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;112&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/HBN_logo_4color-300x112.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In an attempt to address this important question, we analyzed data from the openly shared Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network. Children ages 7-15—and their parents—answered questions about their internet use, how well they sleep, how much exercise they get, and problems they might be having in school, at home, or with other social relationships. Each child also underwent comprehensive psychiatric assessments, which allowed us to examine how internet use might be associated with a range of different clinical syndromes including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because many youth have more than one of these conditions, we also examined how comorbidity across these conditions may also be associated with problematic patterns of internet use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that children who show problematic levels of internet use also have higher rates of depression, ASD and ADHD. We could not discriminate whether those with one or more of these disorders go on to have higher rates of problematic internet use, or if increased internet use was related to the development of psychiatric disorders and functional impairment. Nonetheless, these findings add to a growing literature suggesting associations between mental health disorders and problematic internet usage. We must proceed with caution: how can we discover what constitutes healthy patterns of internet use and make sure our children are taking advantage of all the benefits the internet has to offer while also protecting them from potential consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study focuses on behaviors associated with internet use, rather than quantities of use. This is an important distinction, as it is more reminiscent of measures of addiction, which are primarily defined by behavioral patterns rather than subjective reports that someone “drinks too much”. Before we can discriminate between problematic and non problematic internet use that may be defined differently for different children in different contexts, it will be important to identify behavioral markers of harmful internet use. Examples of such behaviors include displays of aggression when internet time is limited or in response to inquiries about online activities, loss of sleep, negative effects on schoolwork and/or relationships, or a tendency to turn to the internet to avoid unpleasant or difficult activities. Perhaps this shift in focus is more important now than ever, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic increases in internet use that it has necessitated for connecting, socializing and learning. For many, particularly those in the most affected areas under lockdown, these increases will undoubtedly make conventional wisdom about what constitutes “too much” or “too little” internet seem out of touch at least in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most worrisome learning point from our work is that problematic internet usage in children is associated with global functional impairment – beyond the presence of any formal psychiatric disorder. This suggests that a child with ADHD who exhibits problematic internet usage patterns may be more likely to have difficulty in daily life functioning than a child with ADHD and less problematic usage. An important caveat: our findings are based on a one-time snapshot. We can’t draw conclusions regarding internet use as a cause or consequence of childhood disorders. Also, the findings only apply to problematic internet use, not to regular use. In fact, internet use that is not excessive or problematic could actually have beneficial influences on child functioning. We plan to follow up these youth to gain more insight into the nature of the relationships between functional impairment, psychiatric disorders and problematic internet use.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/05/27/does-where-we-live-make-us-lonely/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/house-2683861_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is not a twenty first century creation. Nor is it the result of the physical distancing, self-isolation and distant and remote social relationships we are experiencing as a result of COVID-19. Like joy or sorrow, loneliness can be seen as part of being human. It has been described and experienced by people of different ages, across different cultures and in different historical periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is loneliness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is the feeling or response we have when our social relationships fail to match our expectations or desires. This could be because the quality of the relations is superficial or lacking in the depth and meaning we would like. It can also be because the number of our relationships is lower than we would like. Loneliness may also result when how we experience our relationships, in person, on-line or by telephone, does not match our expectations. This is especially relevant during the distant and remote socializing we are experiencing during COVID-19. On-line or telephone conversations may combat loneliness by enabling us to keep in touch with our family and friends. Alternatively, these types of contact may make us feel lonelier by reminding us how much we miss personal contact. Loneliness is not the same as living alone, spending time alone or being socially isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does loneliness matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness was once seen as a problem that was only experienced by older people. Indeed it was often seen as part of the normal ageing process. Now it is clear that loneliness effects people of all ages.  This is important because being lonely is now seen as so serious that is seen as a public health problem. We now have a Minister for Loneliness and national strategies to combat loneliness. Much of the drive to tackle loneliness is because research has associated it with a range of health problems. These include death, chronic physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, depression and mental health as well as health behaviors such as decreased physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life. We know that those people who experience loneliness reported lower levels of wellbeing, quality of life and life satisfaction. In the flurry of activity focused on the health problems associated with loneliness the links with wellbeing are overlooked. However these are very important and are why I would argue that loneliness really matters. All of us, regardless of age, evaluate our wellbeing and quality of life and this can be reduced by loneliness. For this reason alone, we need to understand loneliness and what factors can make people vulnerable to experiencing loneliness. This is especially important for older adults where national and international policies focus on living well in later life and of having a ‘good old age’. These policy goals mean that we need to understand the drivers of loneliness in later life if we are going to  develop robust ways of addressing loneliness and support a meaningful and good quality of life for our older citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What types of factors are related to loneliness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-large wp-image-11912&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/loneliness-1024x608.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;There are three different types of factors that may make older people vulnerable to loneliness. First there are individual characteristics such as widowhood or bereavement, low income or poor health. Secondly there are community and neighborhood factors such as the availability of parks or availability of facilities such as libraries. Thirdly there can be national or societal level factors such as policies and attitudes to older people. We know very little about how community or neighborhood factors are linked to loneliness. In our study we looked at two area characteristics – the index of multiple deprivation and area type (urban or rural). We studied their relationship with two measures of loneliness for 4,663 adults aged 50 and over who took part in the 2014 wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying lonely places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 18% of participants reported that they experienced loneliness and 25% that they often felt lonely in the area where they lived. It is important to remember that just over two thirds of participants, 68%, did not report either form of loneliness. We found no difference  for either measure of loneliness between participants living in urban and rural areas. There was no relationship between individual loneliness and the deprivation score for the community where participants resided.  There a significant statistical relationship between the level of deprivation of an area and levels of area based loneliness. Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating area and place of residence in loneliness research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing evidence investigating the factors that make older people, and other age groups, vulnerable to loneliness have focused upon individual characteristics such as marital status or household size. We also have evidence linking loneliness to transitions or changes in circumstances such as retirement, bereavement, becoming a carer or the onset of chronic illness. We have extended our understanding  of loneliness by demonstrating a link with deprivation and now need to identify the components of deprivation-housing stock, lack of community facilities, transport, availability of blue-green spaces or lack of community cohesion and trust that are creating lonely places.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Is the coronavirus mutating? Yes. But here’s why you don’t need to panic</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In novels and movies,
infectious pathogens mutate and inevitably become more dangerous. In the blockbuster
movie &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, a deadly virus acquires a mutation in
Africa that causes the global death toll to spike in mere days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reality, however, is far less
theatrical. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, a
few research groups have claimed to identify new strains of the coronavirus,
called SARS-CoV-2, that’s infecting people around the globe. That sounds scary.
But not only is it sometimes difficult to determine whether a change amounts to
a “new strain,” none of the reported changes to the virus have been shown to
make it more dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has led to great
confusion for the general public. Each time such studies surface, fears arise,
and virus experts rush to explain that changes in a virus’s genetic blueprint,
or genome, happen all the time. The coronavirus is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“In fact, it really just
means that it’s normal,” says Kari Debbink, a virologist at Bowie State
University in Maryland. “We expect viruses to evolve. But not all of those
mutations are meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it means to find mutations
in the novel coronavirus, and what evidence is needed to actually raise a red
flag.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;First, a mutation is just a change&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, mutations
don’t do anything to a virus at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viruses are simply protein shells that contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it’s RNA. The building blocks of RNA, called nucleotides, are arranged in triplets, called codons. These nucleotide trios provide the code for building amino acids, which make up the virus’s proteins. A mutation is a change to one of these nucleotides in the virus’s genetic material — in SARS-CoV-2’s case, one of around 30,000 nucleotides.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a mutation in a
triplet is silent, meaning the codon still codes for the same amino acid. But
even when an amino acid does change, the virus might not behave in a way that’s
obviously different. Some mutations could also spawn dysfunctional viruses that
quickly disappear as a result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in fact, these changes can
actually be helpful when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-genetic-fingerprints-are-used-to-rapidly-map-spread&quot;&gt;tracing the virus’s path around the globe&lt;/a&gt;, something researchers have been doing ever
since experts from China released the first coronavirus genetic sequence in
January (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). Scientists can
decipher, or sequence, the virus’s RNA to track changes as it infects more people.
They can then track where and how the coronavirus is spreading in a population,
and monitor for further changes in its genetics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Close relatives&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Researchers can use changes in the coronavirus’s genetic blueprint to better understand how it is spreading. By deciphering viruses taken from patients, they can build a tree (pictured, samples are represented by dots and colored by region where they were collected) to show the genetic relationships among those viruses. The pandemic got its start in China at the end of 2019 (blue circles at the bottom) and has since expanded to five other continents. The horizontal lines depict how closely related two viruses are — longer lines mean there are more differences between them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;Tracking SARS-CoV-2’s genetic changes to map its spread, December 2019–May 2020 &lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088349&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052120_EG_covid-mutation_inline1_desktop_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088349&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=region&quot;&gt;nextstrain.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088350&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052120_EG_covid-mutation_inline1_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists are interested
in tracking mutations even if they don’t alter the protein, says Emma Hodcroft,
a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. “But that
doesn’t mean that it’s a new strain or that it’s a virus that behaves
differently.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A new ‘strain’ of virus doesn’t mean much &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “strain” is “used
very, very loosely by most scientists,” Hodcroft says. “There isn’t really a
strict definition of the word ‘strain,’” particularly when talking about
viruses. Experts might simply be referring to viruses that aren’t genetically identical
— almost like discussing different people.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viruses are always changing.
When a virus infects a cell, it begins making copies of its genetic
instructions. Most viruses don’t have the necessary tools to proofread each
string of RNA for mistakes, so the process is error-prone and differences build up over time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses like
SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, do have a proofreading enzyme — a rarity for RNA viruses. But that doesn’t mean their genomes don’t have
errors. Changes still accumulate, just more slowly than in other RNA viruses such
as influenza. “Strains,” “variants” or “lineages” are all terms researchers
might use to describe viruses that have identical or closely related strings of
RNA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for the general public, a
word like “strain” is often interpreted to mean a whole new scourge. “I think
the use of the term ‘strain’ does little more than cause panic,” says Jeremy
Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in
Worcester. “It doesn’t really get at what the important issues are.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and single-stranded RNA&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088351&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052120_EG_covid-mutations_inline-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088351&quot;&gt;The genetic material for coronaviruses is made up of single-stranded RNA (pictured in yellow). Changes, or mutations, to single nucleic acids (protruding lines in this illustration) in that RNA can either be silent — meaning nothing changes — or alter a small portion of one of the virus’s proteins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088351&quot;&gt;Vchal/iStock / Getty Images Plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most mutations aren’t dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mutation can affect a virus
in a number of ways, but only certain kinds of mutations might make the virus
more dangerous to people. Perhaps the change shields the virus from the immune
system, or makes it
resistant to treatments. Mutations could also alter how easily the virus
spreads among people or cause shifts in disease severity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily,
such mutations are rare. Unfortunately, they can be hard to identify.&lt;/p&gt;

May 5 at bioRxiv.org, for instance, found a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike, a
protein on the outside of the coronavirus that allows it to break into cells. This
new variant is now found more often in places like Europe and the United States
than the original form of the coronavirus. That may mean the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v2&quot;&gt;change makes the virus more transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, the authors concluded. But the study lacked
laboratory experiments to support the claim. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other explanations could also
explain the pattern. The SARS-CoV-2 variant with the mutation could have ended
up in certain regions thanks to random chance — a person infected with a virus that had the new
mutation just happened to hop on a plane — and might have nothing to do with the
virus itself. The study didn’t provide enough evidence to distinguish among the
possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I think has been
potentially confusing to people is that we’re watching this very normal process
of [viral] transmission and mutation happen in real time,” says Louise Moncla,
an evolutionary epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle. “And there’s this real desire to understand whether these mutations
have any functional difference.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;‘Take a deep breath,’ experts say, and expect mutations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand whether a
single mutation changes how the virus works, “it’s not just going to be one
experiment,” Bowie State virologist Debbink says. “It takes a lot of research.”
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to examining
genetic sequences of viruses from coronavirus patients all over the world,
researchers will also rely on studies in lab-grown cells or animals. Such studies
could help pinpoint whether viruses with particular mutations behave
differently. Competition experiments —
where two different viruses are mixed in cells in a dish or used to infect an
animal — can help scientists figure out which variant is more successful at
making copies of itself, that is, which one “wins.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other types of tests could
reveal if mutations in the coronavirus’ spike protein alter how strongly it
attaches to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells&quot;&gt;protein on human cells&lt;/a&gt; that allows it to get inside the cells, virologist
Luban says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/3/20&lt;/em&gt;), or whether changes
modify how easily the virus gets into a cell after binding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But lab results might not provide
the full picture either. “Just because something’s different in a cell doesn’t
necessarily mean that it’s different when you scale that up to the whole human
body,” Hodcroft says. “At the end of the day, you’re going to need some animal
studies or some really good human data.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies take time. Meanwhile,
more coronavirus mutations are guaranteed to pop up over the coming months — and experts will continue to track
them.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The data will tell us whether we need to worry, and in what way we need to worry,” Moncla says. “Everyone should take a deep breath and realize that this is exactly what we’ve always expected to happen, and we don’t necessarily need to be concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re Less Likely To Spread Alarming Information While Experiencing Physiological Stress</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/26/were-less-likely-to-spread-alarming-information-while-experiencing-physiological-stress/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of bad news — fake or otherwise — is likely to be on everybody’s minds at the moment. Whether it’s legitimate updates on the spread or symptoms of coronavirus, or sensationalism more to do with page clicks than scientific fact, it can be hard to tune out of the news cycle — and to know what information you should be passing on to friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has found that alarming information is likely to spread further than positive information; we’re also more likely to share news that confirms our own beliefs and biases. But what impact does the experience of stress have on the sharing of negative or alarming news? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62399-9&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;suggests a complex relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39666&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To examine the relationship between stress and the spread of alarming information, Nathalie Popovic at the University of Konstanz and colleagues recruited 141 participants, who were split into two groups. Half completed a control task, writing notes for a hypothetical job interview that only they would see. The other half prepared the same notes — but, in this condition, were then asked to explain to two interviewers why they were a good fit for the job and perform a mental arithmetic task in order to raise their levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups then read six articles about Triclosan, a controversial chemical substance sometimes used in toothpaste, detergents, soaps, and other consumer goods. Each article took a different position on the substance, containing  a variety of positive, negative and neutral statements about it (despite widespread use, some research suggests it may not be safe). Before and after reading the information, they were asked whether they had heard of Triclosan, whether they were likely to have been exposed to it, and how they perceived the risk of chemical substances in general and Triclosan specifically. They were also given 17 minutes to write a message to another participant about Triclosan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the experiment — at twelve to fifteen minute intervals&lt;span&gt; —&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; subjective stress levels were measured using a scale of one to ten and cortisol was measured using saliva samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants reported an increase in concern after reading articles about Triclosan. But participants in the stress group — who had higher levels of cortisol — were &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; influenced by the articles, showing a smaller increase in concern than those in the control group. They were also less likely to share alarming information in their messages to other participants. The bigger the increase in cortisol, the smaller the increase in concern. But those who reported &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; feelings of stress — even if unrelated to the task at hand — were both more concerned and more likely to share alarming information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the contrast? In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialsciences.nature.com/channels/1745-behind-the-paper/posts/acute-stress-reduces-the-social-amplification-of-risk-perception&quot;&gt;supporting article&lt;/a&gt;, co-author Wolfgang Gaissmaier suggests that acute physiological stress reactions may result in adaptive processes intended to calm us down. For instance, we may naturally downplay negative information when stressed, reducing the perception of risk and leaving us better able to respond to the situation in front of us. &lt;em&gt;Feeling&lt;/em&gt; stressed, on the other hand, may make us feel more alarmed about risky situations, even when they’re not directly related to the source of our anxiety — and may make us more likely to share that stress with others via alarming information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both reactions have downsides. The endocrine stress reaction may make us &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt;estimate risk, potentially blinding us to genuinely dangerous situations. &lt;em&gt;Over&lt;/em&gt;estimating risk, as was seen in subjectively stressed participants, might also get us into trouble: the team uses the example of anti-vaxxers, who erroneously judge vaccines as dangerous and therefore put themselves at risk of serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been ongoing discussions about the spread of alarming views — including those of anti-vaxxers — for the last few years; never have they been more relevant than at the moment, when much of the world is wracked with anxiety and faced with a seemingly endless stream of bad news. Understanding the circumstances in which negative information is more or less likely to spread may help us tackle it before it does too much damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62399-9&quot;&gt;Acute Stress Reduces the Social Amplification of Risk Perception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A star shredded by a black hole may have spit out an extremely energetic neutrino</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-black-hole-high-energy-neutrino</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A neutrino that plowed into the
Antarctic ice offers up a cautionary message: Don’t stray too close to the edge
of an abyss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The subatomic particle may have been blasted
outward when &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05340https:/arxiv.org/abs/2005.05340&quot;&gt;a star was ripped to pieces&lt;/a&gt; during a close encounter with a
black hole, physicists report May 11 at arXiv.org. If it holds up, the result
would be the first direct evidence that such star-shredding events can
accelerate subatomic particles to extreme energies. And it would mark only the
second time that a high-energy neutrino has been traced back to its cosmic
origins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With no electric charge and very
little mass, neutrinos are known to blast across the cosmos at high energies.
But scientists have yet to fully track down how the particles get so juiced up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One potential source of energetic
neutrinos is what’s called a tidal disruption event. When a star gets too close
to a supermassive black hole, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-shredded-star-caught-act&quot;&gt;gravitational forces pull the star
apart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/11/19&lt;/em&gt;). Some of the star’s guts
spiral toward the black hole, forming a hot pancake of gas called an accretion
disk before the black hole gobbles the gas up. Other bits of the doomed star
are spewed outward. Scientists had predicted that such violent events might
beget energetic neutrinos like the one detected.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Spotted on October 1, 2019, the little neutrino packed a punch: an energy of 200 trillion electron volts. That’s about 30 times the energy of the protons in the most powerful human-made particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. The neutrino’s signature was picked up by IceCube, a detector frozen deep in the Antarctic ice. That detector senses light produced when neutrinos interact with the ice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When IceCube finds a high-energy
neutrino, astronomers scour the sky for anything unusual in the direction from
which the particle came, such as a short-lived flash of light, or transient, in
the sky. This time, astronomers with the Zwicky Transient Facility came up with
a possible match: a tidal disruption event called AT2019dsg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First observed in April 2019, that event
had been spied emitting light of various wavelengths: visible, ultraviolet,
radio and X-rays. And the maelstrom was still raging when IceCube detected the
neutrino, according to a team of physicists including &lt;a&gt;Marek
Kowalski &lt;/a&gt;of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, or DESY, in Zeuthen,
Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While intriguing, the association
between the neutrino and the shredded star is not certain, says IceCube physicist
Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved with the new study. “I
don’t know if I have to bet my wallet, but I probably would,” Halzen says. “But
it doesn’t have much money in it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The probability that a neutrino and a similar
tidal disruption event would overlap by chance is only 0.2 percent, the
researchers report. But that doesn’t meet physicists’ stringent burden of proof.
“Just one event is difficult to convince [us] this source is really a neutrino
emitter,” says astrophysicist &lt;a&gt;Kohta Murase &lt;/a&gt;of Penn
State University. “I am waiting for more data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kowalski declined to comment for this
article, as the paper has not yet been accepted for publication in a scientific
journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To have birthed such an energetic
neutrino, the star-shredding event must have first accelerated protons to high
energies. Those protons must then have crashed into other protons or photons (particles
of light). That process produces other particles, called pions, that emit
neutrinos as they decay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists are aiming to pin down
exactly how that acceleration happened. The protons might have been launched
within a wind of debris that flowed outward in all directions. Or they could
have been accelerated in a powerful, geyserlike jet of matter and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AT2019dsg shows some unusual features
that any explanation should be able to account for. X-rays produced in the event,
for example, appeared to drop off rapidly. So physicists WalterWinter of
DESY and &lt;a&gt;Cecilia Lunardini &lt;/a&gt;of Arizona State
University in Tempe suggest May 13 at arXiv.org that the event did produce a
jet, but that a cocoon of material gradually &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06097&quot;&gt;shrouded
the &lt;/a&gt;region, hiding the X-rays from view while still allowing the neutrino to escape. Lunardini declined to comment
because the paper is not yet published in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Murase argues that for the jet to be
hidden, that means it can’t be that powerful of an outflow, making it hard to
explain the energetic neutrino this way. “If it injects a lot of energy, this
energy gets out,” he says. In a third study posted May 18 at arXiv.org, Murase
and colleagues favor the idea that the protons get accelerated in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08937&quot;&gt;outward
flowing wind or in a corona&lt;/a&gt;, a superhot
region near the black hole’s accretion disk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Determining where these particles come
from can help scientists better understand some of the most extreme
environments in the cosmos. Previously, astronomers had matched up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube&quot;&gt;a different energetic neutrino&lt;/a&gt; with a blazar experiencing a flare-up (&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;7/12/18&lt;/em&gt;). A blazar is a bright source of light powered by a
supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Both a blazar flare and a
tidal disruption event “are very special activities, which is when a lot of
energy is released in a small amount of time,” says astrophysicist &lt;a&gt;Ke Fang &lt;/a&gt;of Stanford University, who was not involved
with the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making more observations of high-energy neutrinos
is crucial, Fang says. “This is the only way we can clearly understand how the
universe is operating at this extreme energy.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: New species of scaly, deep-sea worms named after Elvis have been found</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-worms-elvis-species</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new
look at the critters known as “Elvis worms” has the scale worm family all shook
up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These
deep-sea dwellers flaunt glittery, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sparkly-iridescence-exoskeletons-help-camouflage-beetles-predators&quot;&gt;iridescent&lt;/a&gt; scales reminiscent of the sequins
on Elvis’ iconic jumpsuits (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/23/20&lt;/em&gt;).
“For a while, we thought there was just one kind of Elvis worm,” says Greg
Rouse, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif. But analysis of the creatures’ genetic makeup shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/48532/list/9/&quot;&gt;Elvis worms comprise four species
of scale worm&lt;/a&gt;,
Rouse and colleagues report May 12 in &lt;em&gt;ZooKeys&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rouse’s
team compared the genetic material of different Elvis worms with each other,
and with DNA from other scale worm species. This analysis places Elvis worms in
the &lt;em&gt;Peinaleopolynoe&lt;/em&gt; genus of scale worms, which includes two other known
species — one found off the coast of Spain, the other off California. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A new genetic analysis of the deep-sea creatures nicknamed “Elvis worms” reveals that that these iridescent creatures include four separate species. The Elvis worms seen in this video belong to the species &lt;em&gt;Peinaleopolynoe orphanae&lt;/em&gt;, which mostly sport glittery blue scales, but also come in other colors, like black and red. These worms may look dainty, but they fight dirty, chomping at each other’s scales when they get into skirmishes. &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four
newly identified Elvis worm species are scattered across the Pacific, from &lt;em&gt;P.
elvisi &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;P. goffrediae&lt;/em&gt; in Monterey Canyon off California to&lt;em&gt; P.
orphanae&lt;/em&gt; in the Gulf of California by Mexico and &lt;em&gt;P. mineoi&lt;/em&gt; near
Costa Rica. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These
deep-sea Elvis impersonators share some common traits, such as nine pairs of scales.
But each species has its own distinct flare. &lt;em&gt;P. elvisi&lt;/em&gt;’s gold and pink iridescent
color scheme earned it the honor of keeping the worms’ namesake in its official
title. &lt;em&gt;P. orphanae&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, mostly sports rainbow-sparkled
scales of a bluish hue.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t know why Elvis worms have evolved such eye-catching scales, since the animals live in the dark, deep sea. It could just be a side effect of developing thicker scales over time, which happen to refract more light, Rouse says. Thicker scales could come in handy in a fight, since Elvis worms are apparently biters, a behavior discovered while watching a worm skirmish. “Suddenly, they started doing this amazing jitterbugging — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNAIeD_FlQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;wiggling, and then fighting&lt;/a&gt; and biting each other” on their scales, Rouse says. “No one’s ever seen any behavior like this in scale worms.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: How coronavirus stress may scramble our brains</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-stress-brain</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m on deadline, but
instead of focusing, my mind buzzes with unrelated tidbits. My first-grader’s
tablet needs an update before her online school session tomorrow. Heartbreaking
deaths from COVID-19 in New York City make me tear up again. Was that a kid’s
scream from upstairs? Do I need to run up there, or will my husband take care
of it? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These
hornets of thoughts drive out the clear thinking my job demands. Try as I might
to conjure up a coherent story, the relevant wisps float away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m
scattered, worried and tired. And even though we’re all socially isolated, I’m
not alone. The pandemic — and its social and economic upheavals — has left
people around the world feeling like they can’t string two thoughts together.
Stress has really done a number on us. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That’s
no surprise to scientists who study stress. Our brains are not built to do
complex thinking, planning and remembering in times of massive upheaval. Feeling
impaired is “a natural biological response,” says Amy Arnsten, a neuroscientist
at Yale School of Medicine. “This is how our brains are wired.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Decades
of research have chronicled the ways stress can disrupt business as usual in
our brains. Recent studies have made even more clear how stress saps our
ability to plan ahead and have pointed to one way that stress changes how
certain brain cells operate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists recognize the pandemic as an opportunity for a massive, real-time experiment on stress. COVID-19 foisted on us a heavy mix of health, economic and social stressors. And the end date is nowhere in sight. Scientists have begun collecting data to answer a range of questions. But one thing is clear: This  pandemic has thrown all of us into uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Short-circuited&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human brain’s
astonishing abilities rely on a web of nerve cell connections. One hub of
activity is the prefrontal cortex, which is important for some of our fanciest
forms of thinking. These “executive functions” include abstract thinking,
planning, focusing, juggling multiple bits of information and even practicing
patience. Stress can muffle that hub’s signals, studies of lab animals and
humans have shown. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even
relatively mild stress can impair the prefrontal cortex,” says Elizabeth
Phelps, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Harvard University. “That’s one of
the most robust effects of stress on the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That impairment has been described in lots of studies. One memorable example comes from 20 panicky medical students facing licensing exams. After a month of high-stress test prep, the students performed worse on an attention test than they did after exams were over. Functional MRI scans showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/912.long&quot;&gt;under stress, the students’ prefrontal connections to other brain areas were diminished&lt;/a&gt;, scientists reported in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

But with stress, those chemical signals can flood the brain, activating amygdala-linked brain networks involved in sensing and responding to threats (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088323&quot;&gt;A. Arnsten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When
the prefrontal cortex goes quiet, more reactionary brain networks take over.
Some of these “primitive” circuits, as Arnsten calls them, center on the
amygdalae, two almond-shaped structures buried deep inside the brain that help
us sense and respond to threats. Those fast, instinctual reactions “are helpful
if you’re being faced with a snake,” Arnsten says, “but not helpful if you’re
being faced with a complex medical decision.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A more recent experiment, published online April 2 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, illustrates how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982220303420?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;stress can shift people away from thoughtful planning&lt;/a&gt;. When people were threatened with electric shocks, their abilities to plan ahead flew out the window. Anthony Wagner, a cognitive neuroscientist at Stanford University, and colleagues asked 38 people to learn a familiar route through virtual towns. With practice, people learned these routes, as well as the locations of recognizable objects, such as a zebra, an apple, a stapler or Taylor Swift’s face, along the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our
question was, ‘What are the effects of stress?’ ” Wagner says. To find out, the
researchers used “moderately painful” electric zaps to induce stress in some
participants, who returned to familiar virtual towns and were asked to find
their way to the zebra, for instance. Subjects didn’t know when they would be
shocked, and they couldn’t control any aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After
the training, the participants — some under stress from the expectation of
further shocks and some not — were sent back into the virtual town and asked to
find their way to a specific item. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
there was a trick: Participants could reach the stapler, for example, faster
and more efficiently by taking a shortcut. The shortcut, however, required more
planning, more initiative and a heavier reliance on previously learned
relationships among streets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stressed
people were less inclined to take the shortcut, the researchers found. People
who were stressed by the possibility of a shock took the shortcut 31 percent of
the time, compared with 47 percent for those who weren’t stressed. The stressed
people still reached the object they were after, but in a roundabout way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a virtual town, people devised a shortcut (left map, red dotted line) to reach a target object. But under the threat of a moderate electric shock, people were more likely to fall back on a familiar route (right map, green dotted line), even though it was longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;

Brown, S.A. Gagnon and A.D. Wagner/&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;drawing of map of virtual town used in experiment&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088320&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/060620_LS_inline-1-map_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088320&quot;&gt;T.I. Brown, S.A. Gagnon and A.D. Wagner/&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Functional
MRI brain scans hinted at what the added stress did to the volunteers’
thinking. The objects planted around town evoked recognizable patterns of brain
activity when a person was seeing one of the previously seen objects, or even
just thinking about it. By spotting these neural signposts, researchers could
tell when people were thinking of a particular path — or of no path at all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants
were given eight seconds to plan their approach to reach the target object.
Unstressed people generally had a plan; their brain activity contained patterns
that signaled these volunteers were thinking about the objects along the
shortcut route. Neural signals of a plan even showed up among those who chose
to take the familiar route. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those
awaiting a shock appeared to use little foresight. “The stressed people didn’t
seem to be thinking about the familiar route when they took it,” says study
coauthor Thackery Brown, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
“They were on this fight-or-flight autopilot type behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s
more, stress quieted the activity of brain areas needed to make a good plan,
including a part of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, a structure
important for memory. Those findings suggest that under stress, we are less
able to call up our previously learned knowledge and memories. We are working
with a deficit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In
some sense, we’re privileged when we’re not stressed, able to fully harness our
cognitive machinery,” Wagner says. “That allows us to behave in more strategic,
more efficient, more goal-directed ways.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown
sees parallels between these lab-based stressors and the complex and
longer-lasting stresses of real life. The participants were attempting to do
something complicated while worrying about something else. The stressor is
“operating in the background while you’re trying to plan your daily life,”
Brown says. “There’s a connection there with the type of thing people are
experiencing right now in the context of the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Shrunken cells&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zooming in to individual
cells provides a view of stress’s physical destruction in the brain. Stress can
shrink nerve cells and cull their connections, and the prefrontal cortex is
particularly vulnerable, studies in both humans and other animals suggest.
Other kinds of brain cells are affected too, new research on mice shows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Big, arboreal cells called astrocytes have many jobs in the brain. Specialized astrocytes called Bergmann glia extend into synapses, the space between nerve cells where chemical messages flow, and slurp up extra chemical signals. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astrocytes-help-speed-brains-messages&quot;&gt;helps keep nerve cells communicating clearly&lt;/a&gt; with one another (&lt;em&gt;SN Online: 8/4/15&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in a test of mice stressed by the ominous smell of a predatory fox, these astrocytes retracted from synapses, neuroscientist Siqiong June Liu of Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans and colleagues found. That pulling away occurred with a single exposure to that stressful fox odor, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/40/17/3374&quot;&gt;the cells were still retracted 24 hours later&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers reported in the April 22&lt;em&gt; Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stress
sends a “shrink” message to these astrocytes by reducing the levels of a
protein called GluA1. It’s not known whether a similar process, and the
resulting changes in how brain cells communicate under stress, happens in the
brains of people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some stress signals may travel certain neural highways. Physiologist Kazuhiro Nakamura of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan and colleagues studied rats that had just been through the stressful experience of losing a fight, a defeat that is meant to mimic human social stress. A somewhat mysterious region inside the rat’s prefrontal cortex, called the DPC/DTT for dorsal peduncular cortex and dorsal tenia tecta, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6482/1105&quot;&gt;important for sending stressed-out signals&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers reported in the March 6 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From
there, the signals shoot to the hypothalamus, a brain structure that can spark
some of stress’s most obvious effects in the body, including a racing heart and
sweating. It’s possible that similar brain areas in humans might have roles in
sparking stress signals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These
clues are giving scientists a more precise understanding of how stress moves
through and affects the brain. But lab studies on stress, by design, have to be
somewhat short-lived, with relatively mild stress. Applying lab findings to
people’s experiences in life comes with caveats. Huge questions remain about
how the crushing and varied stresses of a pandemic might influence people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A natural experiment&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and brain scientists are on it. As of mid-May, a database tracking COVID-19 social science projects had &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research/&quot;&gt;294 research projects related to the current pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These kinds of natural experiments — studying people who had experienced uncontrollable, intense stress in their lives — have happened before. Phelps and colleagues studied how people remember the events of 9/11. People who were in downtown Manhattan at the time of the attacks seemed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/104/1/389&quot;&gt;rely more heavily on their amygdalae to call up memories of the shocking event&lt;/a&gt; than people who were farther away, the researchers reported in 2007 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. Other researchers have identified thinking problems in people who lived through Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stress
from the COVID-19 pandemic might influence decision making, Phelps suspects.
How do you respond to positive and negative feedback when you’re stressed? Does
your desire to do hard work change? She and colleagues are hoping to get
answers by surveying people across the United States. Participants will
describe their stress reactions and complete online tasks that test decision
making and memory. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Other
long-term studies will examine how autobiographical memories of the pandemic
change over time, how the pandemic affects stress during pregnancy and how
mind-set might influence how people cope. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As
this chaotic period rolls on, stressors will change and accumulate. Sustained
crisis, scientists suspect, can change our brains and their capabilities in
even more profound ways than temporary stress. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For
now, each of us is left to manage our own personalized stress cocktails. Mine
grows more potent with an expanding backlog of tasks, both domestic and
job-related, the cumulative sorrow of seeing my kids isolated from their
friends and a steady drip of small losses. And I worry for the many people who
are worse off, facing illness and financial strain. It’s a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we all grapple with this reality, scientists have a message for us, one that I find comforting: “Forgive yourself,” Phelps says. “If you’re finding it challenging right now to focus, forgive yourself.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embracing the stress&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most advice about how to weather
extreme stress covers basic care and feeding of the body: Eat right, exercise
and get enough sleep. Those three good ideas hover near the top of many
self-help lists, as does making time to connect (for now, remotely) with friends
or doing something that brings joy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
here’s something else that might help: a mind-set adjustment. Stress — even
severe stress — doesn’t have to be a bad thing, says psychologist Alia Crum of
Stanford University. She and colleagues have found that beliefs about stress
have a lot to do with how someone experiences challenges. People who believe
stress can be an enhancing part of life do a better job of handling challenges,
evidence suggests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even for people in the brutal Navy SEALs training program,&lt;a href=&quot;https://mbl.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9941/f/2020_seals_smith_et_al_frontiers_in_psychology.pdf&quot;&gt; those with a stress-is-enhancing mind-set lasted longer&lt;/a&gt; in the program than people who considered stress debilitating, Crum and colleagues reported January 15 in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. “Positive, even transformative, effects can occur under even the most extreme stressors,” Crum says. “These effects are simply more likely to occur when people are in a mind-set that orients them that way.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help people begin to shift their thinking, Crum has helped develop &lt;a href=&quot;http://sparqtools.org/rethinkingstress-instructions/&quot;&gt;an approach with three main steps&lt;/a&gt;: Acknowledge the stress, recognize that we stress over things we value and finally, figure out a way to use that stress to our advantage.  &lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.neuromatch.io/&quot;&gt;Neuromatch Academy&lt;/a&gt; is an online summer school in computational neuroscience at scale, and &lt;strong&gt;we need TAs like you&lt;/strong&gt;! Here’s what we’re planning:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1500 students spread over 50+ countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9 timezones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;45 hours of content (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW8dbFbdOjo&amp;amp;list=PLkBQOLLbi18MVjPmL-4obNev5FfjCDRxh&quot;&gt;sample day&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;60 colab tutorials (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/tree/master/tutorials&quot;&gt;sample day&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teaching by 200 TAs (one of which could be you!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s an experiment in democratizing computational neuroscience education, and we can’t do it without TAs. As a TA, you’ll teach a small group of people (aiming for 6:1 student:TA ratio) who are slightly earlier in their careers (typically early masters and early PhD students in neuroscience). You’ll:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;help students&lt;/strong&gt; from diverse background get quality education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learn &lt;/strong&gt;more about computational neuroscience – there’s no better way to master a subject than to teach it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;get access to NMA’s network of &lt;strong&gt;mentors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;receive &lt;strong&gt;teacher training&lt;/strong&gt; by seasoned educators specialized in project-based learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;see and help this huge project being built in realtime (like Asaph says in his vid, it really feels like an &lt;strong&gt;adventure&lt;/strong&gt;). If you wanna learn about project management, education, building tech at scale, etc. this is the place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(bonus) have something great to talk about in your teaching statement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;It really feels like an adventure&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’ll get compensated for your time (1500$ for three weeks). Round 2 applications for Teaching Assistants are due &lt;strong&gt;Monday May 25th&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re interested in being a TA and haven’t received a Round 2 application or did not apply to Round 1, &lt;strong&gt;you can still apply&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Why anti-vaxxers are rising again</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624857730/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of a health crisis when our only hope is a new vaccine, many have begun to wonder how those with anti-vaccination sentiments might respond to the current COVID-19 crisis. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/health/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-intl/index.html&quot;&gt;Many have guessed&lt;/a&gt; that the only natural, rational response would be for anti-vaxxers to change their minds and wholeheartedly embrace the prospect of a new vaccine. After all, there is a prevailing theory that anti-vaccine sentiment arises at least in part from a collective amnesia about the true scourge of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccines, so the argument goes, are a victim of their own success, resulting in a situation in which people do not remember why they are getting vaccinated because the diseases that the vaccines prevent against have been absent for so long. If this theory is true, then in a situation in which we are face-to-face with the ill effects of an infectious pathogen, we should all readily embrace a new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the anti-vaxxer response to COVID-19 and the prospect of a new vaccine, much like science denialism more generally, is much more complex than that. The response also seems to suggest that the idea that amnesia about diseases that have been largely conquered by vaccines is probably not the primary reason for anti-vaccine sentiments. So how have people with anti-vaccine tendencies responded to COVID-19? While it’s still too soon to have a complete picture of this, especially since no new vaccine has been rolled out yet, several interesting patterns have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staunch anti-vaxxers still oppose vaccines, including potential new coronavirus vaccines, and are active at spreading misinformation. Those who have not made up their minds about whether vaccines are safe &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/anti-vaccination-community-divided-how-respond-to-coronavirus-pandemic&quot;&gt;are now wavering more&lt;/a&gt; than they were previously. Whereas before they may have been slightly more inclined in the anti-vaccine direction, now they are questioning those viewpoints more. They do seem to remain amenable to being persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public figures, such as politicians and musicians, who are staunch anti-vaxxers &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://theconversation.com/what-impact-will-the-coronavirus-pandemic-have-on-anti-vaxxers-135153&quot;&gt;are facing more opposition now&lt;/a&gt;. Crisis situations have the tendency to bring certain background issues into high relief. People who may have found anti-vaxxers to be somewhat irritating but not a direct threat are now viewing them differently and thus more social pressure is being placed on anti-vaxxers to abandon their views and change their behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, anti-vaxxers are very active and very vocal, both about potentially refusing a new vaccine for coronavirus but also&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/a-fake-pandemic-antivaxxers-are-spreading-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/&quot;&gt; increasingly voicing conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; about coronavirus itself. These conspiracy theory claims run the gamut, from claiming the virus is not as bad as public officials note to warning people that public officials and government bodies like the CDC are not to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another very disturbing development is the migration of objections to a putative coronavirus vaccine away from a scientific and health basis and toward a more general political basis. Anti-vaxxers are now linking stay-at-home orders and the hoped-for vaccines as assaults on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html&quot;&gt;liberty and freedom&lt;/a&gt;. Although anti-vaxxers have always made personal liberty a part of their message, by incorporating objections to a coronavirus vaccine into the broader context of freedom, they have taken this link to an extreme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidi Munoz Gelisner, a leader in anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protests, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html&quot;&gt;told a reporter&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, “we have always been about freedom.” This adds a new dimension to our efforts to ensure that there is swift uptake of a coronavirus vaccine as soon as it becomes available. Targeting the pro-vaccine message on issues of vaccine safety and efficacy may not address this broader issue. Of course, the notion that vaccines involve a personal liberty aspect is faulty: it is long recognized that no one has the right to jeopardize the health of others, especially children, and therefore that democracies can legitimately enforce vaccine requirements. Nevertheless, Americans are perhaps more insistent about a broad range of personal liberties than citizens of any other country and therefore we will have to consider ways to address this aspect of anti-vaccination sentiment as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01221-y&quot;&gt;90 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against the virus that causes COVID-19 are now in various stages of development and the most optimistic predictions would give us a viable one in a year to 18 months. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.axios.com/what-experts-say-works-for-combating-coronavirus-misinformation-146084b8-1312-403d-b948-3e190f16b7f3.html&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, indicates that we can no longer rely on debunking myths about vaccines after they have been promulgated throughout the media. Rather, her work calls for “proactive messaging,” in which groups of experts begin to thwart anti-vaccination messages before a crisis promoted by misinformation begins. Thus, we need to start immediately to use evidence-based communication methods to preempt the different varieties of misinformation about a vaccine for COVID-19.

	<title>Science News: Politics aside, hydroxychloroquine could (maybe) help fight COVID-19</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-politics-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-research</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s announcement
that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T8j5UMjPAc&quot;&gt;he is taking the
drug hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt; as a precaution against the coronavirus has once
again thrown a decades-old antimalarial drug into the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s currently not enough data to say
whether the drug can protect people from catching COVID-19 or from getting very
ill if they do get infected with the virus. Studies of its use in treating very
sick patients have shown mixed results and, in some cases, have led to
dangerous side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, with the president touting hydroxychloroquine
even as scientists issue cautions about its use, the drug has found itself at
the center of political divides, to the possible detriment of figuring out
whether it works. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, researchers are busy
testing hydroxychloroquine and a related drug called chloroquine to see if they
can either prevent infection or keep illness from worsening. Nearly 200
clinical trials are under way or planned around the world to test the drugs,
either alone or in combination with other medications. That includes at least
28 trials examining whether either drug can protect healthcare workers and
others at high risk of getting COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here’s what scientists know about the drugs
and their potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Why do researchers think chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may prevent coronavirus infections?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both are antimalarial drugs that also have
well-known antiviral activity against many viruses, including SARS and MERS. At
least they work against those viruses in lab dishes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, hydroxychloroquine can
also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0&quot;&gt;stop
SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, from infecting cells and
decreases replication of viruses that do get inside cells, researchers report
March 18 in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;. A February
4 report in &lt;em&gt;Cell Research&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0&quot;&gt;chloroquine also
inhibits the virus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The drugs are thought to block viruses
from entering cells by changing the pH, or acidity, of cellular compartments
called lysosomes. That “creates a less friendly environment for the virus, so
it might be more difficult for the virus to get into human cells in the first
place,” says Michael Avidan, an anesthesiologist at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis. Avidan is involved in a clinical trial testing
whether chloroquine can protect healthcare workers from infection or from
developing serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2286-9&quot;&gt;disrupt
interactions&lt;/a&gt; between some of SARS-CoV-2’s proteins with proteins called
sigma receptors in human cells, researchers report April 30 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Interrupting those protein
interactions may make it difficult for the virus to replicate, says study
coauthor Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a microbiologist who directs the Global Health
and Emerging Pathogens Institute of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in
New York City.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, those antiviral capabilities
make the drugs attractive for use against the coronavirus. But there’s another
important reason chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were some of the first
drugs pressed into action: They’re available. Doctors have been prescribing the
drugs, already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for decades
and they’re generally safe, although there are some serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Time is of the essence,” says Adam
Spivak, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake
City. “When you have a drug that you understand and can safely administer
that’s on the shelf, that’s the drug you reach for first.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hydroxychloroquine is better tolerated
by most people, so is the one researchers are testing more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nurse at a hospital in St. Louis&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088329&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2052220_ti_hydroxychloroquine_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088329&quot;&gt;Charge nurse Caroline Becker adjusts her face shield before entering a patient’s room at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Several studies are testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine’s ability to protect healthcare workers from COVID-19, including a chloroquine study headed by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088329&quot;&gt;Matt Miller/Washington Univ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;But isn’t taking hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine dangerous?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can be for some people, such as those
prone to heart problems, or when taken in combination with other drugs that can
alter heart rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While hydroxychloroquine latches on
sigma receptors proteins that are used by the virus, it can also bind to other
proteins in the heart, Garcia-Sastre said in a news conference May 15. “It may
not be the best drug that we can use right now to inhibit viral replication in
people because of this.” Some other drugs also interrupt the coronavirus’s
interactions with sigma receptors, but don’t bind to the heart proteins, which
may make them safer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-cough-syrup-medicine-ingredient-virus-worse&quot;&gt;alternatives
to hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt;, Garcia-Sastre said (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/30/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In trials with very sick people, hydroxychloroquine
has caused sometimes fatal heart-rhythm problems. People with existing heart
problems, those with low potassium levels or low oxygen levels in their blood
are especially vulnerable to these serious side effects, says Raymond Woosley,
a pharmacologist the University of Arizona in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The largest study to date, published May
22 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, found that the
drugs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;raised
the risk of death&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The findings are
based on data from more than 96,000 coronavirus patients in 671 hospitals on
six continents. Of those, nearly 15,000 received either chloroquine or
hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with a type of antibiotic
called macrolides — usually azithromycin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for risk factors, including age, obesity, sex, underlying diseases, smoking and the severity of COVID-19 at the start of treatment. Among people taking hydroxychloroquine alone, 18 percent died; 16.4 percent of those taking chloroquine alone died; and combining either drug with a macrolide was associated with even higher numbers of deaths. In comparison, only 9.3 percent of people taking neither drug died.  The drugs were also associated with heart rhythm irregularities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those findings led a group overseeing a clinical trial for COVID-19 treatments for the World Health Organization to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---25-may-2020&quot;&gt;temporarily suspend testing of hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt;, pending a safety review, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced May 25. A committee will review data collected so far in the trial and decide whether to continue testing hydroxychloroquine. Testing for three other drugs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments&quot;&gt;the trial&lt;/a&gt; will continue without pause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Safety concerns about hydroxychloroquine have mainly come from use of the drug in people who are sick in the hospital with COVID-19, says Susanna Naggie, an infectious disease doctor at Duke University School of Medicine. She is leading a clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic to protect healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients. Because of reports of harm in very sick COVID-19 patients, “people have kind of forgotten about the decades of safety data that we do have in an ambulatory, healthy population,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In places where malaria is a problem,
people often take the drugs without any serious side effects, says Ira
Baeringer, chief operations officer of Rising Pharmaceuticals, a company based
in East Brunswick, N.J. that donated hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for
several large clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, studies looking at hydroxychloroquine
use before or early in infection haven’t produced any of the heart rhythm
problems seen in studies of seriously ill patients. “When used alone, we’re not
seeing major issues,” says Sarah Lofgren, an infectious disease doctor at the
University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, where researchers are
testing hydroxychloroquine’s ability to prevent COVID-19. “Out of our thousands
of patients, we’re not seeing things people are quite concerned about,
particularly the heart arrhythmias.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers are taking
precautions when giving the drug to healthy people. People with existing heart
problems, kidney disease or who are taking other drugs that may alter heart
rhythms aren’t allowed to participate in the trials. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Isn’t there already evidence that hydroxychloroquine doesn’t work against COVID-19?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, and no. Very few rigorous trials of
the drug have reported data. Some people were given the drug in studies in
which there wasn’t a control group that got placebos, and results from some of
those studies have been mixed, with some reporting benefits, others showing no
effect, and some indicating that the drugs may even be harmful for some
patients. Even the latest data from the large multinational study in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; combined studies that used the
drugs in different doses and in different ways that may not be directly
comparable.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat
rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. It is effective against those diseases because
it helps regulate the immune system’s responses, pushing away from harmful
inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the immune system also
plays an important role in COVID-19, Spivak says. So researchers thought that
hydroxychloroquine might be able to calm overactive immune reactions that do
damage to people with severe cases of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early evidence from tests of the drug
points to hydroxychloroquine having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-evidence-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-help-treat-covid-19&quot;&gt;no
effect in combatting the disease&lt;/a&gt; in seriously ill patients (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/21/20&lt;/em&gt;).
The large &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;failed
to show any benefit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But just because the drug didn’t seem to
help in late stages of the disease, that doesn’t mean it won’t be effective if
given early, perhaps even before people are exposed to the virus, Avidan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you bring on a star player
consistently [only] in the last minute of a game and you’re still losing, you
might say, ‘This star player is no good,’” Avidan says. “But that’s not a good
use of your star player, because most of the outcome is already established at
that very late stage.” Bringing a star in early to play the whole game, he
says, may produce a much better outcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what researchers are
attempting in multiple trials testing the drugs effectiveness as a
preventative, or prophylactic, treatment for the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of those trials are just wrapping
up — including two trials at the University of Minnesota — but aren’t reporting
results yet. Others are still under way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Utah, Spivak and colleagues have
begun testing 40 people of the planned 400 for a trial to determine whether
hydroxychloroquine can shorten the duration of virus production in people who
have tested positive. “If we get results by February, I’m going to be
ecstatic,” Spivak says. “Although, February feels like a century away given all
that is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, there’s no evidence that
hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine can prevent COVID-19, but there’s also no
evidence that they can’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;So what’s the big deal about the president saying he’s taking hydroxychloroquine?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors and researchers worry that based
on the president’s endorsement, people will take the medications without
medical supervision and could do harm to themselves. When President Trump first
touted hydroxychloroquine in March, internet searches seeking places to buy the
drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2765361&quot;&gt;increased
1,389 percent&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report April 29 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Interest in buying the drug peaked again
after reports of a fatal poisoning resulting from taking a fish tank treatment
containing chloroquine, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These drugs have been villainized and
politicized,” Baeringer says. “That leads to hyperbole on both sides of the
debate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have voiced concern
that so many people would take hydroxychloroquine on their own that researchers
wouldn’t be able to find enough people not taking the drug to participate in
clinical trials. That hasn’t happened, Spivak says. “The public has been
appropriately wary of it,” he says. “The pendulum has swung. There was huge
interest, then there was a lot of negative press and warnings. We’ve had a lot
of local press stories where people came to us said, ‘Hey, wait, you’re still
doing that?’ The science follows the pace of the news cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, enrollment in the studies has
both fallen, and risen, with greater media and political attention, Lofgren
says. One study recruited volunteers via the internet. Initially there was
excitement and quick enrollment, but “as it became a political, partisan
medication, our enrollment really dropped down,” she says. “This week we’ve had
a bump in enrollment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And soon, researchers hope to have data
that will say whether the drugs are effective or not. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers are investigating whether flashing lights could be used to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s disease, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200519-alzheimers-can-flashing-lights-provide-a-new-treatment&quot;&gt;David Robson writes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future. &lt;/em&gt;People with Alzheimer’s seem to have weak gamma brainwaves, and animal studies suggest that directly inducing brain activity at these frequencies can kick-start the brain’s immune cells. Now researchers are looking at whether inducing these waves non-invasively, through flickering lights or sounds, could help patients.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39653&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We hear a lot about failed replications — so here’s some good news&lt;/strong&gt;. Prospect theory, a key tenet of behavioural economics, has passed a large replication attempt that involved more than 4,000 participants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/the-science-behind-human-irrationality-just-passed-a-huge-test/&quot;&gt;writes Cathleen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s going on in the brain during a near-death experience? &lt;/strong&gt;Such experiences are difficult to study from a neuroscientific perspective — but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-near-death-experiences-reveal-about-the-brain/&quot;&gt;Christof Koch explores the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In many parts of the world, professional sports leagues are beginning to return to action — but they’re playing to empty stadiums. &lt;/strong&gt;So how will this affect the behaviour of players and referees? It’s going to be an interesting time for sports psychologists, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/will-empty-bleachers-change-the-psychology-of-sports/&quot;&gt;writes Eric Niiler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the government relaxes some lockdown measures, people may experience anxiety when faced with the prospect of going back to work or school. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-how-to-beat-anxiety-when-going-back-to-work-138550&quot;&gt;mental health researcher Olivia Remes has some advice&lt;/a&gt; about dealing with these worries and feelings of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And while humans may be feeling more fearful than before, the opposite is true for many other animals&lt;/strong&gt;. Our sudden absence from many public spaces has changed animals’ “landscape of fear”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-coronavirus-has-changed-animals-landscape-of-fear/&quot;&gt;writes Jason G. Goldman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; — which is why you see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2020/mar/31/goats-take-over-empty-welsh-streets-llandudno-coronavirus-lockdown-video&quot;&gt;videos of goats taking over empty streets&lt;/a&gt; in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Scientists sometimes conceal a lack of knowledge with vague words</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-sometimes-conceal-lack-knowledge-vague-words</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You can’t
kill a virus, common wisdom contends, because viruses aren’t alive to begin
with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet some viruses
sure act like they’re alive. And in fact, you can find biologists and
philosophers who will insist that viruses do deserve a branch on the tree of
life. Still, many oth­er experts refuse to confer viruses with life status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Debates
about viruses as life-forms (or not) have raged for decades. But as more and
more data on viral vitality accumulate, the disagreements do not diminish. Perhaps
that’s because the argument is not really about the nature of viruses. Rather
it’s about the definition of &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists can’t agree on that,
either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Science’s
inability to define &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; reveals not merely a lack of lexicographic
dexterity, but also signifies a broader issue — the peculiar way that science’s
relationship with reality is connected to science’s relationship with words. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Words are
obviously indispensable for scientists, both to communicate among themselves
and to report their findings to the rest of civilization. Even in the most
mathematical of sciences, words must be attached to symbols in order to relate
mathematical relationships to real-world phenomena. Words like &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;stress tensor&lt;/em&gt; describe a physical entity corresponding
to a symbol in an equation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But many
scientific ideas do not reduce to a neat mathematical expression, so the words
are on their own. And sometimes the ideas originate with the words. Throughout
history, scientists have often coined a word before fully formulating the underlying
idea. As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote in his poetic play &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;, in
the absence of ideas, words can come to the rescue. “With words, the mind does
its conceiving,” reads &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/German/FaustIScenesIVtoVI.php&quot;&gt;one translation&lt;/a&gt;. (Or, in another version, “If your
meaning’s threatened with stagnation, then words come in, to save the
situation.”)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So sometimes
scientists adopt a term, and use it widely, even though no precise definition
of that term is universally accepted. &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; is an obvious example. It’s a
word that most people instinctively understand yet nobody can define to everybody
else’s satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We all think we can recognize a living organism when we see one,” biochemists Athel Cornish-Bowden and María Luz Cárdenas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264719302151&quot;&gt;wrote in the February issue&lt;/a&gt; of the journal &lt;em&gt;BioSystems&lt;/em&gt;, “but it is not so easy to give a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of ‘living’ that includes all the entities we consider to be alive, and excludes the ones we do not.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some
proposed definitions of life, for instance, include the capacity to reproduce,
note Cornish-Bowden and Cárdenas, of Aix-Marseille University in France. Sounds
good, but what about mules? They can’t reproduce, but most people would agree
that mules are alive, the biochemists point out. “Taking the minority view that
mules cannot be regarded as alive does not solve the problem, because many
people, including many distinguished biologists, have passed the age when they
can reproduce, but would dispute any claim that they are not alive.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; is one of many common scientific
words that elude precise definition. And scientists have often used much vaguer
terms, typically as stand-ins for primitive, imprecise ideas — some that turned
out to be in essence correct, others totally wrong. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ancient
Greeks, for instance, invented the word &lt;em&gt;atom&lt;/em&gt; to describe the tiniest,
“uncuttable” pieces of matter. But no Greek had any real knowledge of what an
atom actually was like (and of course, they had no proof that atoms even
existed, as atom denier Aristotle vigorously argued). But the concept turned
out to be roughly right. Chemists in the 18th century, on the other hand,
insisted that fire depended on a substance called phlogiston. But &lt;em&gt;phlogiston&lt;/em&gt;
was just a word, linked to an idea that turned out to be completely erroneous.
Similarly &lt;em&gt;impetus&lt;/em&gt;, a term popular in medieval times for discussing
Aristotle’s views on how objects in motion kept moving, lost its momentum once
Galileo and Newton debunked Aristotle. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In more
modern times, the word &lt;em&gt;gene&lt;/em&gt;, like &lt;em&gt;atom&lt;/em&gt;, initially described a
primitive idea, not yet fully formed. (&lt;em&gt;Gene,&lt;/em&gt; referring to an element of
heredity, was coined by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909, decades
before anybody knew how DNA worked.) Over the last century the definition of
gene has evolved, though it’s still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genetics.org/content/205/4/1353&quot;&gt;not as rigorously defined&lt;/a&gt; as all scientists would like. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of science’s
problem in linking words to meanings is (as experts in language repeatedly
remind us) that there’s always a gap between a word and the reality it
represents. “The word is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the thing,” the semanticist S.I. Hayakawa emphasized
in his famous book &lt;em&gt;Language in Thought and Action&lt;/em&gt;, just as a map is not
identical to the territory it depicts. Some scientific terms serve as pretty
reliable maps of reality, while others turn out to be decoys leading to dead
ends. A major part of scientific progress is narrowing the gap between word and
thing — transforming vague labels into more specific symbols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy
to find many current examples of scientific terms that mimic knowledge while
actually disguising a lack of understanding. “Dark matter” and “dark energy”
must exist, physicists insist, while admitting nobody yet can say what they
actually are. Other deep mysteries baffling today’s best scientific detectives
also reflect an inability to bring words closer to things. &lt;em&gt;Consciousness&lt;/em&gt;
is a prime example, referring to mental processes that have eluded anything
approaching a coherent physical description. &lt;em&gt;Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; comes a little
closer to intelligible meaning, but not sufficiently to avoid all sorts of
arguments about reproducing it artificially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another
favorite problem word for physicists, &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, poses a plethora of puzzles.
For one thing, it has multiple meanings — &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; of day is not the same
thing as period of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; is not the same thing as &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; travel. Physicists
still squabble over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arrow-time&quot;&gt;why time’s arrow points only to the future&lt;/a&gt; and whether the flow of time is an
objective physical fact or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/its-likely-times-are-changing&quot;&gt;an illusion in a “block universe”&lt;/a&gt; where all events are already
sitting there, just waiting for a conscious observer to witness them. Of
course, it may turn out that time’s mysteries are problems more of language
than of physics. “We run into puzzles about the concept of time and then
we say, oh, what a terrible thing,” the physicist John Archibald
Wheeler once said. “We don’t realize we’re the source of the
puzzle because we invented the word.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only time
(another meaning) will tell whether words like &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;consciousness&lt;/em&gt;
express ideas of greater depth than scientific understanding has yet reached. Maybe
&lt;em&gt;consciousness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; will turn out to be prophetic terms, like &lt;em&gt;atom&lt;/em&gt;,
that foreshadow the emergence of reliable scientific concepts. Or maybe &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;consciousness&lt;/em&gt; (and who know what other words) will go poof! like &lt;em&gt;phlogiston&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In any
case, it’s remarkable how often words masquerading as ideas can eventually lead
to successful scientific endeavors. Entire fields of scientific research have grown
from word-seeds invented in the absence of substantiated ideas — &lt;em&gt;atom&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;gene&lt;/em&gt; being the best examples. As Goethe went on to note in &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With
words fine arguments can be weighted, with words whole systems can be created.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it
might be a good idea to remember that the character speaking those lines was
Mephistopheles, Goethe’s representative of the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Pollen-deprived bumblebees may speed up plant blooming by biting leaves</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollen-deprived-bumblebees-may-speed-plant-blooming-biting-leaves</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bumblebee tip that
might get a slowpoke plant to bloom early. Just bite its leaves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least three species of
bumblebees use their mouthparts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aay0496&quot;&gt;snip little confetti bits out of plant foliage&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the May 22 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. This foliage biting gets more
common when there’s a pollen shortage, says Consuelo De Moraes, a chemical
ecologist and entomologist at ETH Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experiments show that mustard
and tomato plants nibbled by &lt;em&gt;Bombus terrestris&lt;/em&gt;
bees bloomed earlier than unbitten plants by days, or even weeks, say De Moraes
and her colleagues. So for the bumblebees, accelerating bloom times could be a
lifesaver. When trying to found colonies in early spring, the bees rely on flower
pollen as a protein source for raising their young.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foteini Paschalidou, an
ecologist now at France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research in Versailles-Grignon, was the first team member to call attention to the
behavior. She was working on a different project with caged &lt;em&gt;B. terrestris&lt;/em&gt; bees indoors. At first, De
Moraes worried. “Is it something wrong with them?” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The bees’ supplier and some
farmers who used them to pollinate crops assured the researchers that nipping happens
elsewhere, although the team hasn’t found any accounts in the scientific
literature. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test a link between leaf biting
and pollen shortages, the researchers did a caged-bee test. After three days
without pollen, bumblebees trapped with nonblooming plants were more likely to
poke holes in foliage than a bee group buzzing among plentiful flowers. When
researchers swapped the bees’ situations, the insects now trapped without
blooms started nibbling leaves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests done on the roof of
the lab building with bees free to seek flowers in rooftop planters and elsewhere
also found a link between pollen shortage and increased leaf biting, the
researchers report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bee on leaf, leaf with holes&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052120_SM_bee-bite_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088281&quot;&gt;During a pollen shortage, a bumblebee cruising a leaf (left) becomes more likely to make quick punctures and cuts that leave small holes (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088281&quot;&gt;F. Pashalidou &lt;em&gt;et al/Science&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notion that bee damage to
a leaf could jump-start flowering originally struck coauthor Mark Mescher of
ETH Zurich as a long shot. Yet in lab tests, tomato plants punctured five to 10
times by pollen-deprived bees bloomed 30 days earlier on average than undamaged
plants. But the speed-up time varied by plant species. For instance, bee-nipped
black mustard (&lt;em&gt;Brassica nigra&lt;/em&gt;) bloomed
only about 16 days early. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bee-pestered plants’
acceleration is not entirely unprecedented. Some other forms of stress,
including drought, skimpy nutrients and assault by leaf-eating insect pests, also
have triggered early blooming, Mescher points out. But just what’s going on
with the bee bites and how they might tap into the internal clock that triggers
a plant to switch from leafing to flowering remain big questions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, the best efforts of
human scientists waiting with forceps and a razor on a lab rooftop to mimic bee
activity in real time, bite by bite, on comparison plants have produced only
modest acceleration in the black mustard, and no
meaningful change in the tomatoes. So
there might be something special in a bee bite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a happy accident, the
outdoor trials attracted visits from two other &lt;em&gt;Bombus&lt;/em&gt; species that checked out the plants on offer and also nicked
holes in leaves. That confirms that leaf nibbling is not just some quirk of a
commercial lineage of bees, although two long-time bumblebee watchers — Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex in England
and Lynn Adler at the University of Massachusetts Amherst — say they’ve never noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goulson says he’s fascinated by the idea. &lt;em&gt;B. terrestris&lt;/em&gt; commonly cuts holes in plant parts, but in a slightly different context. Instead of groping for nectar through the natural openings of flowers, these and other bumblebees often just bite little holes through the outer wall of a flower for a sip. “I can imagine that hungry bees unable to find flowers might try biting leaves in desperation,” Goulson says. Flower biting might thus have evolved into leaf biting, though, as Mescher points out, it could have happened the opposite way, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With those intriguing ideas
buzzing around, clearly now is a great time to go watch bees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: There are two versions of the coronavirus. One’s not more dangerous than the other</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-two-versions-disease-severity</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Differences among patients, not the genetic makeup of the coronavirus, determines how severe COVID-19 will be, a study finds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Factors such as a person’s age and white blood
cell counts are associated with disease severity, an
analysis of 326 COVID-19 patients from Shanghai shows. Older people and people
with low levels of certain immune cells &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-t-cells-patients-immune-system&quot;&gt;known as
T cells&lt;/a&gt; and high levels of an immune chemical called IL-6 tended to be
sicker. But the version of the coronavirus that people were infected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2355-0&quot;&gt;made no difference in
how sick they got&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports May 20 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IL-6 is a protein known as a cytokine, one of many proteins that signal the immune system to rev up defenses. Overactive immune, known as cytokine storms, are a problem for people with severe cases of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team identified two major versions of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, called clade I and clade II, by examining the genetic makeup of the virus from 94 of the cases and 221 genomes in the GISAID coronavirus database. GISAID is a repository that maintains thousands of viral genomes — the complete set of genetic instructions of a virus — compiled by researchers around the world. Those genomes are used in monitoring how the virus is evolving and tracing its path around the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two mutations distinguish clade I
from clade II. Other researchers had previously found the same genetic changes,
and speculated that one version may be more virulent or transmit better among
people. But the new data show no difference in contagiousness or disease
severity between people infected with either clade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clade I was associated with six cases from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Clade II was found in early cases of the disease in Wuhan that weren’t associated with the market. Comparing the genetic makeup of the two versions, researchers conclude that the coronavirus probably made the leap from an animal to humans sometime in late November. The seafood market wasn’t where the virus originated, the team says, but was where people became infected with clade I, drawing attention to the new coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Up to 220 million people globally may be at risk of arsenic-contaminated water</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arsenic-contamination-drinking-water-global-map-risk</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As many as 220 million
people around the world may be at risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba1510&quot;&gt;drinking arsenic-contaminated groundwater&lt;/a&gt;, a new study finds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining climate,
environmental and geologic data with machine learning, researchers made a global
map, described in the May 22 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;,
that predicts where groundwater arsenic concentrations are likeliest to exceed
10 micrograms per liter, a safe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic&quot;&gt;drinking water limit&lt;/a&gt; set by the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is present in trace
amounts in many different types of soil and rock. It becomes harmful to people when
it leaches out of these soils and into groundwater, which can occur due to a
variety of chemical processes. Long-term exposure can lead to skin lesions and
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have previously
identified many hot spots of arsenic contamination in groundwater, including
regions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arsenic-agriculture-irrigation-may-worsen-bangladeshs-woes&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/arsenic-spurs-adaptation-argentinian-villagers&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;
and Vietnam (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/20/02&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 3/5/15&lt;/em&gt;). But data on groundwater
arsenic are lacking for many other regions. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So environmental scientist
Joel Podgorski and hydrologist Michael Berg, both of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology in Dübendorf, set out to create a
high-resolution global risk map based on dozens of different environmental
factors, from temperature and precipitation to soil age and pH. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the last 12 years,
there’s a lot more data that has become available,” Podgorski says. He and Berg
amassed data from almost 80 studies. They then used a machine learning
technique called the “random forest” method, which created predictions of
arsenic risk at a resolution of one square kilometer, based on different
subsets of the data. The researchers then averaged the results of about 10,000
different predictions together to create the final map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Arsenic hot spots&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers made this global map to predict where groundwater arsenic concentrations are likeliest to exceed 10 micrograms per liter, a safe drinking water limit set by the World Health Organization. Red indicates areas with a high probability of exceeding that limit, while dark blue indicates low probability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt; Where the risk of arsenic-contaminated groundwater is highest &lt;/h6&gt;

Podgorski and M. Berg/Science 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is “really the
first truly global risk map of arsenic contamination in groundwater,” Podgorski
says. The map shows many of the expected hot spots for arsenic contamination,
particularly in Asia and South America. But it also highlights possible
elevated risk in less well-studied regions, including central Asian countries
such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia, a broad swath of countries around the Sahara
as well as in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even in the United States,
more than a million rural residents &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b02881&quot;&gt;may be unknowingly
exposed to arsenic contamination&lt;/a&gt; in their drinking water wells. Risk maps based on statistical
models, such as the map created by Podgorski and Berg, cannot predict
individual well water arsenic concentrations, writes geochemist Yan Zheng of
the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb9746&quot;&gt;in a commentary&lt;/a&gt;
in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. But, she notes, the map’s “greatest value
lies in identifying potential areas at risk
that have not had testing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Podgorski agrees. “This is a basic message of the map; it should be used as a guide to more testing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: Stunning images of swirling gas and dust may show a planet forming</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-planet-forming-stunning-images-swirling-gas-dust</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the first time,
astronomers may have seen direct evidence of a planet forming around a young
star.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spiral disk of gas and
dust surrounding the star AB Aurigae contains a small S-shaped twist near the spiral’s
center, infrared telescope images show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That twist “is the precise
spot where a new planet must be forming,” says astrophysicist Emmanuel Di Folco
of the University of Bordeaux in France. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, astronomers have
seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infant-worlds-carve-gaps-planet-forming-disk&quot;&gt;gaps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
11/6/14&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swirling-gases-reveal-baby-planets-young-stars-disk&quot;&gt;large-scale spirals&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/14/18&lt;/em&gt;) that are thought to be created by unseen planets
in disks of gas and dust around young stars. Theories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite&quot;&gt;how planets coalesce and gather material from these
disks&lt;/a&gt; predict that planets’ motions
would further twist the gas around them like swirling skirts, pinpointing a
planet’s location (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Di Folco and colleagues
have used infrared observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array and the Very Large Telescope, both in Chile, to find a spiral and &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.eurekalert.org/scipak/gallery/images/2020-05/pashalidou5HR.jpg&quot;&gt;zero in on one such S-shaped twist&lt;/a&gt; around AB Aurigae. The team describes its findings in
the May &lt;em&gt;Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;AB Aurigae and bright knot&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088255&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052020_lg_baby-planet_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088255&quot;&gt;A close-up of the disk of gas and dust (seen here in infrared light) around the young star AB Aurigae (left) reveals a bright knot (right, circled in white) where astronomers think a planet is coalescing. For scale, the blue circle represents the size of Neptune’s orbit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088255&quot;&gt;A. Boccaletti et al/&lt;em&gt;Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics &lt;/em&gt;2020, ESO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was amazing,” Di Folco
says. “It was exactly as we were expecting from the theoretical predictions of
planet formation.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The star, about 520
light-years away in the constellation Auriga, is just 4 million years old, about
one one-thousandths of the age of the sun. “It’s really a baby,” Di Folco says.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential planet’s exact mass is not known, but it probably would have to be a gas giant like Jupiter rather than a rocky planet like Earth to make such big waves in the disk. And it might not be alone — there’s a hint of another planet near the disk’s outer edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Zooming in on the star AB Aurigae, located about 520 light-years away in the constellation Auriga, reveals a swirl of gas and dust that includes a small S-shaped region where a new planet may be forming.  &lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Science News: As we wait for a vaccine, here’s a snapshot of potential COVID-19 treatments</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-accelerated-vaccines-treatments-drugs</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aggressive public health measures to
stem the tidal wave of coronavirus infections have left people isolated,
unemployed and wondering when it will all end. Life probably won’t go
completely back to normal until vaccines against the virus are available,
experts warn. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard on that
front. At least six vaccines are currently being tested in people, says Esther
Krofah, chief executive of the FasterCures center at the Milken Institute in Washington,
D.C.  “We expect about two dozen more to
enter clinical trials by this summer and early fall. That is a huge number,”
Krofah said at an April 17 briefing. Dozens more are in earlier stages of
testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In unpublished, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people&quot;&gt;preliminary results of a test of one vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, inoculated people made as many antibodies against the coronavirus as people who have recovered from COVID-19 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). The mRNA-based vaccine induces human cells to make one of the virus’s proteins, which the immune system then builds antibodies to attack. That study was small, only eight people, but a second phase of safety testing has begun. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating&quot;&gt;vaccines
take time to test thoroughly&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/21/20&lt;/em&gt;). Even with accelerated
timelines and talk of emergency use of promising vaccines for health care workers
and others at high risk of catching the virus, the general public will likely
wait a year or more to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, new treatments may help
save lives or lessen the severity of disease in people who become ill.
Researchers around the world are experimenting with more than 130 drugs to find
out if any can help COVID-19 patients, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-04/Covid19%20Tracker%20NEW4-16-20-2.pdf&quot;&gt;a
tracker&lt;/a&gt; maintained by the Milken Institute. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speed it up&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speed it up The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation proposed a truncated process for COVID-19 vaccine development that replaces the lengthy, traditional linear sequence for testing, producing and licensing a vaccine (top). The new approach (bottom) involves running many steps in parallel, including ramping up manufacturing, even before knowing the vaccine will work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Traditional vaccine development&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graphic illustrating traditional timeline of vaccine development&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088235&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/060620_ti_vaccine_inline_timeline-traditional.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Pandemic pace&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graphic illustrating pandemic timeline of vaccine development&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088234&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/060620_ti_vaccine_inline_timeline-pandemic.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088234&quot;&gt;E. Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of those drugs are aimed at
stopping the virus, while others may help calm overactive immune responses that
damage lungs and other organs. Although researchers are testing a battery of
repurposed drugs and devising new ones, there is still a great deal of
uncertainty over whether the drugs help, or maybe even hurt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The wait is frustrating, but there’s still much doctors and scientists don’t know about how this new coronavirus affects the body. Getting answers will take time, and finding measures to counter the virus that are both safe and effective will take even more. Early results suggest that the antiviral drug remdesivir can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain&quot;&gt;modestly speed recovery&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-19 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). It is not a cure, but the drug may become the new standard of care as researchers continue to test other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Head-on attacks&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antiviral drugs interfere with a virus’s ability to replicate itself, though such drugs are difficult to create. Remdesivir is being tested in half a dozen clinical trials worldwide. The drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs&quot;&gt;mimics a building block of RNA&lt;/a&gt;, the genetic material of the coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/10/20&lt;/em&gt;). When the virus copies its RNA, remdesivir replaces some of the building blocks, preventing new virus copies from being produced, laboratory studies have shown. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early results in COVID-19 patients given the drug outside of a clinical trial showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment&quot;&gt;68 percent needed less oxygen support after treatment&lt;/a&gt;, as reported online April 10 in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/20&lt;/em&gt;). The drug went to very sick patients, including those who needed oxygen from a ventilator or through tubes in the nose. Other researchers have disputed those results, questioning the study methods and statistical analyses, which may have given an exaggerated impression of good outcomes. The study’s authors say they have reanalyzed the data and still conclude that remdesivir has benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the U.S. National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced that hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 who got intravenous remdesivir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19&quot;&gt;recovered
more quickly&lt;/a&gt; than those on a placebo: in 11 days versus 15. Those findings
had not been reviewed by other scientists at the time of the announcement. The
dug provides researchers with a baseline for comparing other treatments. “We
think it’s really opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability
of treating,” Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID said April 29 in a news
briefing at the White House. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antiviral medications used against HIV are also being tested against COVID-19. The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir stops an HIV enzyme called the M protease from cutting viral proteins so that the virus can replicate itself. The SARS-CoV-2 virus produces a similar enzyme. But early results from a small study in China showed that the combination &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial&quot;&gt;didn’t stop viral replication or improve symptoms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/19/20&lt;/em&gt;), and there were side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the Society of Critical Care
Medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://sccm.org/getattachment/Disaster/SSC-COVID19-Critical-Care-Guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US&amp;amp;_zs=4soSf1&amp;amp;_zl=k1cc6&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR3JxzPVQMDdqD4Sxt3MDjy0KqR7zrXiqO3zQMc2BCIjMAUO8AifEKh0DIA&quot;&gt;recommends
against&lt;/a&gt; using the drugs, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America
says patients should get the drugs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management/&quot;&gt;only
as part of a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. Several large trials may report results soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HIV drugs may not work well against SARS-CoV-2, even though the viruses have similar M proteases: The coronavirus’s enzyme lacks a pocket where the drugs fit in the HIV version of the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This illustrates why antiviral drugs are
so difficult to develop. Designing a drug requires knowing the 3-D structure of
the virus’s proteins, which can take months to years. But researchers are
already getting some close-up views of the new coronavirus. A team in China
examined the structure of the coronavirus’s M protease and designed small
molecules that could block a part of the protein necessary to do its job. The
team &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/21/science.abb4489&quot;&gt;described
two such molecules&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed 11a and 11b, April 22 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In test tubes, both molecules stopped the virus from replicating in monkey cells. In mice, 11a stuck around longer in the blood than 11b, so the researchers tested 11a further and found it seemed safe in rats and beagles. More animal tests will probably be needed to show whether it stops the virus, then multiple stages of human tests will have to follow. The drug development and testing process often takes on average 10 years or more, and can fail at any point along the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have already recovered from COVID-19, and many are donating blood that might contain virus-fighting antibodies. Clinical trials are under way to test whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-can-plasma-recovered-patients-treat-sick&quot;&gt;antibodies from recovered patients&lt;/a&gt;’ blood plasma can help people fight off the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/25/20, p. 6)&lt;/em&gt;. More such trials are planned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Helping the immune system&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping the virus is only half the problem. In some people seriously ill with COVID-19, their immune system becomes the enemy, unleashing storms of immune chemicals called cytokines. Those cytokines trigger immune cells to join the fight against the virus, but sometimes the cells go too far, causing damaging inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective&quot;&gt;drugs used to calm cytokines&lt;/a&gt; in cancer patients (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/18, p. 22&lt;/em&gt;) may also help people with COVID-19 ride out the storm, says cancer researcher Lee Greenberger, chief scientific officer of Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Several of those drugs are being tested against the coronavirus now. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved to
treat autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, became a
household word after President Trump touted it as a possible COVID-19
treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug is being tested in numerous
large clinical trials around the world to see if it might help calm cytokine
storms in COVID-19 patients as well. But so far, there is no solid evidence that
it works either to prevent infection in people or to treat people who already
have the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in some studies the drug has caused serious side effects, including causing irregular heartbeats, says Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix. People with heart problems, low potassium or low oxygen levels in their blood are at higher risk of these side effects, he says. And those are exactly the kinds of patients who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. “So, the very sickest COVID patients are those at most risk for these life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiac effects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results of some rigorous clinical trials
of hydroxychloroquine are expected this summer. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration allows the drug to be used when no other treatment is
available and patients can’t join a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s enthusiasm for any drug that
seems promising feels familiar, says Woosley. He remembers the excitement over
AZT, the first drug used to fight HIV in the 1980s. It wasn’t the best drug to
combat the AIDS epidemic, and better ones came later. Likewise, the first
treatments for COVID-19 might be better than nothing, but not the best we will
ultimately get. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we wait. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of clinical trials going on around the world, some answers may come soon. But for now, keeping the coronavirus contained will probably require aggressive testing, tracing and isolating contacts of people who have the virus and continued social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Remembering the Caregivers</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;pixabay&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-1-1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a rapidly aging population of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) starting dialysis, the demands on caregivers have increased.  The need for help with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing), mobility, transportation, social support and food preparation are often not anticipated.  The burden of these additional roles and lack of support can have a major negative impact on the caregivers physical, social and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; publication, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01830-9&quot;&gt;Shah et al.&lt;/a&gt; compared the health related quality of life and the care related quality of life among caregivers of older individuals (&amp;gt;75 years of age) receiving dialysis or conservative care (medical management only).  Caregivers completed surveys that assessed their health related quality of life and experience as caregivers  These surveys addressed areas that healthcare teams often forget such as activities outside care-giving, social support, institutional support, control over caring and relationship with t&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11898 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-300x200.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;he care recipient. Utilizing this survey highlights the changes in the caregiver’s life that are often not considered in counseling about end stage kidney disease management with patients and the families. While there was no difference in the HRQoL, the caregivers of dialysis patients reported a worse carer experience, where the survey results of this group reflected the perception of providing an ‘intense’ level of care to recipients in bad health and for more than 20 hours/weeks. This is especially striking considering 70% of the caregivers surveyed had been providing this level of care for &amp;gt;2 years.  These findings highlight the need to expand the dialysis preparations and the support provided to caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, protocols focus on education about dialysis modality options, early referrals for dialysis access planning/creation and information for the patient about the dialysis procedure.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/15/suppl_3/8/1849543&quot;&gt;Most of the data&lt;/a&gt; that has helped shape the current approaches have been based on outcomes such as the number of hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality, nutritional status, or infection rates in patients starting dialysis with little or no preparation. While these are important issues to address, this approach does not consider the overall impact of dialysis on the life of the patient or the effects on the caregiver, including changes to their lifestyle, employment and family responsibilities.  As such, many caregivers struggle with how to accommodate the needs of their family member without the skills and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing number of older individuals needing dialysis support, there is a higher likelihood that they will have comorbidities and thus a potentially greater need for help with care. As a result, caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation. This impact on caregivers was noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(02)44553-2/abstract&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; of 100 hemodialysis patients and their primary caregivers utilizing the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).  After more than 4 months of dialysis, caregivers were reported to have higher subjective burden scores.  Current practices do not encompass follow-up with the caregivers to see how they are adjusting to the initiation of dialysis and how they are dealing with the transition.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/23/12/3960/1888462&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of studies with interventions for informal caregivers demonstrated only three studies with interventions for caregivers and these involved education material to enhance caregiver knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach to dialysis preparation falls short if providers are not first acknowledging with patients and their caregivers the impact of end-stage kidney disease on their lives and providing the resources and support they need during this transition period.  Understanding what is important to them and what they do on a day-to-day basis in terms of work, family, and social obligations needs to be part of routine discussions.  Discussions about the impact on the family and caregivers also needs to be part of the routine dialysis preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The oldest disk galaxy yet found formed more than 12 billion years ago</title>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-spiral-disk-galaxy-wolfe-alma</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oldest disk-shaped galaxy
ever spotted formed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, a new study
finds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s much earlier than astronomers thought that this type of galaxy could form. Previous observations show that disk-shaped galaxies — including sprawling, spiral systems like the Milky Way — didn’t show up in large numbers until between 3 billion and 4 billion years after the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This precocious galaxy’s
existence suggests that massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2276-y&quot;&gt;can grow up relatively quickly&lt;/a&gt;, astronomers report in the May 21 &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By showing that a disk
galaxy could form so early in the universe’s history, the new study “challenges
the accepted paradigm for how disk galaxies form and evolve in the universe,”
says astrophysicist Rachel Somerville of the Flatiron Institute in New York
City, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The earliest galaxies
probably were made when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clumps-dark-matter-could-be-lurking-undetected-our-galaxy&quot;&gt;clumps of invisible dark matter&lt;/a&gt; pulled in surrounding gas and dust, forming stars and
eventually creating galaxies that were round and blobby, observations and
computer simulations suggest (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/26/18&lt;/em&gt;). Theorists reason that assembling
those early galaxies was a violent process that scrambled and heated gas. Since
hot gas expands, the idea goes, the first galaxies were spherical blobs because
they were too hot for the gas to settle into a disk. Only when gas has had lots
and lots of time to cool off could it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alma-images-starburst-galaxy-star-formation&quot;&gt;collapse into bright starry disk galaxies&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/3/18&lt;/em&gt;), researchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years, however,
computer simulations have showed that cold streams of gas could sneak into ancient,
blobby galaxies, potentially making it easier for disk galaxies to arise more
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see if that process,
called the cold accretion method, actually occurs in the universe, astronomer
Marcel Neeleman and colleagues sought the earliest disk galaxies they could
find. Most early galaxies are too far away and thus too faint for Earth-based
telescopes to catch light from their stars. But sensitive radio telescopes can detect
light from even more distant quasars — blazing, white-hot disks surrounding
supermassive black holes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus&quot;&gt;filtering through the galaxies’ gas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/12/18&lt;/em&gt;). A bright quasar behind the
early disk galaxy, called DLA0817g, let it show up in silhouette, revealing the
galaxy’s contents and structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;radio wave image of a spiral galaxy called the Wolfe Disk&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3088231&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051920_lg_olddiskgalaxy_inline-599x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3088231&quot;&gt;The oldest disk galaxy ever spotted (shown in radio waves) was seen with the ALMA radio telescope in Chile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3088231&quot;&gt;M. Neeleman, ESO, NAOJ, ALMA, S. Dagnello/NRAO, AUI, NSF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neeleman, of the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1285&quot;&gt;first saw hints of DLA0817g&lt;/a&gt; using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array in Chile, the team reported in 2017.
Follow-up observations in 2019 showed that the galaxy is rotating like a record:
Half of the galaxy’s gas is moving away from Earth, and half is moving toward us.
That motion is a sure sign that the galaxy is a cold, flat rotating disk, and
likely has a spiral shape, the scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The galaxy is also massive,
at least 72 billion times the mass of the sun. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-active-galaxies-early-universe-may-have-finally-been-found&quot;&gt;Behemoth galaxies have been spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the early universe before (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/7/19&lt;/em&gt;). Growing
a massive galaxy of any shape so quickly “is challenging enough,” says astronomer
and study coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska of the University of California, Santa
Cruz. “But the shocker is to see one in a nice spiral disk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team unofficially named
the galaxy the Wolfe Disk after astrophysicist Arthur Wolfe of the University of
California, San Diego, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/in_memoriam_arthur_m._wolfe_1939_2014&quot;&gt;who died in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Wolfe was one of the first to suggest that disk galaxies existed in
the universe’s infancy, to widespread skepticism, says Prochaska, who was one
of Wolfe’s Ph.D. students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He was right, at least partially,” Prochaska says. “He deserves credit for having planted that flag against all conventional wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv.org blog: New User-Driven Classification Tool Released</title>
	<link>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/05/20/new-user-driven-classification-tool-released/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The correct categorization of scholarly works is vitally important. It helps readers find the information they seek — and assures authors that their research will be found by the right audience. Recently, arXiv released a new user-driven classification tool to help authors choose the correct category for their papers during the submission process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this is a great addition, and I am already seeing positive effects,” said Frank Simon, Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, Munich, Germany and arXiv moderator. “Since the feature has been in operation, submitters tend to classify things for my category (physics.ins-det) correctly more often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When submitting to arXiv, authors select a category for their paper, such as computational geometry or quantum physics. Now, in real time, the automated classifier double checks that selection by comparing the paper to those already hosted on arXiv.org. If the author’s selection doesn’t match the classifier’s recommendation, an alternate category is proposed. The author can review the suggestion, accept or decline it, and continue the submission process, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;This is a screen shot of arXiv's classifier recommendation tool.&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-624 size-full&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, only moderators had access to the automated classifier recommendations, after submission. Moderators reviewed the recommendations, and, if necessary, reclassified papers. This added time to the process and often led to delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the classifier recommendations into the submission process empowers authors and increases transparency when reclassification is necessary. Additionally, this feature is expected to reduce the workload for moderators and lower the number of papers put on hold due to misclassification. Improved category selection during the submission process will provide more accurate classification at the outset and therefore reduce delays in announcing papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my category, the most common issue is the case where instrumentation papers that should have physics.ins-det as primary category are instead submitted to hep-ex, nucl-ex, physics.optics or the like, and subsequently need to be reclassified,” Simon said. “Alerting the submitters that their instrumentation paper should be submitted to the instrumentation category rather than one of the others will reduce moderation workload and speed up the release of the articles, so it is a win-win situation for both submitters and moderators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other moderators have also expressed enthusiasm about the new feature, calling it important, worthwhile, a fantastic idea, and a big step forward, “even if there will be hiccups” in the beginning. In the first four days after release, 17.4% papers received category recommendations and 67.5% of authors accepted the suggested category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv continues to welcome feedback on this feature, which was first tested by volunteer moderators. Authors who receive a category recommendation will have the opportunity to complete a survey about their experience. Moderators are sharing their observations and experiences with arXiv staff, and staff members are monitoring server log statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, arXiv is developing a new version of this machine learning classifier tool that will be trained by feedback from users and moderators in order to provide better category recommendations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage the arXiv community to participate. Join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing&quot;&gt;user testing group here &lt;/a&gt;and share your experiences on Twitter with the hashtag #arXivexperience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Memory Complaints Are More Common Among Older Adults With Particular Personality Traits</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory complaints are &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02982590&quot;&gt;fairly common among elderly people&lt;/a&gt;. Together with low participation in cognitively demanding activities, such as reading or doing crosswords, they can predict future declines — including the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem likely, then, that people with poorer cognitive functioning may report more problems, and may be less able to engage in (and so benefit from) reading or other stimulating activities. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-15673-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychology and Aging&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that another factor is more important in predicting both these complaints and engagement in stimulating activities: personality.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39638&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Patrick Hill at Washington University in St Louis, analysed data from 136 Swiss older adults, with an average age of about 70. (The data came from a bigger study into how the everyday behaviour of older people is linked to maintaining or improving wellbeing and health). The participants first completed a series of lab-based cognitive tasks, including memory tests, and self-report questionnaires, which included an assessment of the “Big Five” personality traits. Then, at the end of each of the next ten days, they used smartphones to report on any cognitive complaints during that day (e.g. “I misplaced or lost an object such as keys or glasses”), and also instances of cognitive engagement (e.g. “I enjoyed thinking about a complicated problem”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account each participant’s age, education level and subjective health, the team then looked at how initial cognitive task results and personality trait scores might relate to the subsequent smartphone data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the number of daily cognitive complaints was significantly correlated with scores on all of the personality traits, but just one of the measures of  cognitive performance (processing speed). Strikingly, scores on the two initial specific memory tests did not correlate with daily cognitive complaints. (This somewhat surprising observation is in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714573&quot;&gt;supported by recent work&lt;/a&gt; that suggests our cognitive self-perceptions are relatively distinct from our actual performance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all of these variables were put into a model, however, only one factor emerged as being key. This was openness to experience, a personality trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits, and a willingness to try new things.  Participants who initially scored higher for openness went on to report, on average, fewer cognitive complaints each day, and also more, and more varied, cognitive engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be two reasons for this, the researchers suggest. Firstly, measures of openness tap into a person’s self-perceptions of their intellectual ability and creativity. People with a stronger belief in their intellectual capacities may perceive fewer cognitive issues in daily life. Secondly, people who are more open are of course more willing to engage in varied novel experiences. Because they enjoy intellectual activities, they may be driven to think more, and in more different ways — and this could protect against cognitive decline. In fact, there are other recent findings that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607863.2019.1655705&quot;&gt;diversity in cognitive activity&lt;/a&gt;, rather than total time spent in these kinds of tasks, may be more beneficial for cognitive performance in older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work also suggests that in understanding why some interventions work better for some older people than others, personality traits should be taken into account. Also, interventions that encourage openness may potentially be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the researchers themselves add, all of the personality traits, demographic variables and initial cognitive performance measures only account for a small amount of the differences in the level of cognitive complaints and engagement between people. The team would like to see more work to drill into potential links with personality in finer detail. But other factors that are yet to be well-characterised — levels of stress, perhaps — may well turn out to be far more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-15673-001&quot;&gt;Daily cognitive complaints and engagement in older adulthood: Personality traits are more predictive than cognitive performance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Preprints and the Media: A change to how PLOS handles press for papers previously posted as preprints</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8JlRc1UWymM/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was written by Beth Baker, PLOS’ Senior Media Relations Manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#PowerToThePreprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS actively encourages the posting of preprints – please see &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for all the ways authors can engage. Posting of preprints and discussion of preprints will never &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From today, articles accepted at PLOS journals that were previously posted as a preprint will be under a press embargo which lifts upon publication. This alters our prior practice of not applying an embargo to articles that were previously posted as a preprint and means that we will be applying a consistent press embargo to all articles published at PLOS. We have made this decision after conducting research revealing the positive impact of press embargoes for PLOS papers. The change will optimize authors’ opportunities to disseminate their work to the public via the press and will ensure that authors who have posted preprints are not disadvantaged by this choice, nor are authors disincentivized to post preprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open communication of research, and the value of embargoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ press embargo policy is designed to positively impact researchers and to aid the communication of their work. We work to facilitate open communication of research wherever possible. PLOS encourages the discussion of research between scientists at all stages in the publication process. Researchers are free to present and discuss their work for scientific purposes prior to publication. This includes talking about research at conferences and on preprint servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we know that preprints play a crucial role in the efficiency of scientific communication, establishing priority sooner, increasing attention, and opening up the review process to all, we also believe that public attention at scale via the media should focus on the most reliable science: published, peer-reviewed research. Press embargoes continue to be the best tool to facilitate that. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embargoes enable authors to achieve accurate, high-quality media coverage which disseminates their peer-reviewed research to non-expert readers. Since our articles are accessible to everyone, everywhere upon publication, our embargoes also ensure that peer-reviewed published articles are accessible to the public when first reported in the media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embargoes provide fair and equal access for journalists to allow them time to research their stories and to speak with experts. They give press officers adequate time to coordinate coverage with scientists at their institutions, and give researchers the opportunity to provide comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discussion of research prior to publication, whether in the scientific community or in the media, will never affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal. Prior coverage in the media may simply affect if and how PLOS promotes that research at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background to our research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS partnered with preprint server bioRxiv in May 2018 to help authors opt in to preprints. Soon after, we decided not to embargo for media purposes any published papers which had previously been posted as preprints, believing that embargoes might not be meaningful, necessary, or practical for these papers. Instead, we distributed press releases for such research without embargo at the time of publication, and encouraged institutions to do likewise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following implementation of this embargo exception for preprinted papers, we heard concerns from journalists, press officers and the UK Science Media Centre about this policy. Some parties felt that releasing preprinted research without embargo could result in less media coverage, or in lower quality, less accurate coverage, as journalists would race to report on research immediately or decide not to cover it at all. Concerns were also raised that not embargoing preprinted research meant forfeiting a valuable tool to help journalists focus on covering peer-reviewed published research rather than non-peer-reviewed preprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ media team therefore investigated the claim that non-embargoed preprinted papers received less media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we researched and what we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We took all the preprinted papers we’d press released without embargo between October 1, 2018 (when we introduced the policy) and September 11, 2019 and paired each with a paper we’d press released under embargo that published at around the same time. Each paired paper was from the same journal as the preprinted paper, and for our multidisciplinary journal PLOS ONE, we also ensured the paired paper was in the same broad scientific area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We examined the amount of media coverage each paper had received by measuring the number of mentions of the paper in the media, using media intelligence software Meltwater. We used paired t tests to assess if differences found were statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We found that the preprinted papers press released without embargo received significantly less media coverage than the paired papers press released under embargo. This was true both in terms of total media mentions (74.60 more media mentions (19.27 vs 93.87); 95% CI: 14.07 – 135.13) and in terms of media mentions in the highest profile outlets (1.47 fewer high profile mentions (0.07 vs 1.53); 95% CI: 0.55 – 2.39). We note that our sample size was small, comprising 30 preprinted papers press released without embargo and 30 paired papers, and we only examined two broad measures of media attention. However, these results support the anecdotes we had previously heard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we are reacting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research indicates that embargoed papers receive more media coverage, including in the most high-profile news outlets, than papers which are not embargoed. A practice of not embargoing papers previously posted as preprints therefore risked disadvantaging authors who posted preprints, and/or disincentivizing the posting of preprints, which PLOS actively encourages. We have decided to change our practice to treat all our authors equally, and to maximize authors’ opportunities to work with the press to disseminate their work to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From today, all PLOS publications promoted to the press will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/embargo-policy&quot;&gt;embargoed until the time of publication&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that this change will enable all our authors to reap the benefits of the embargo system – whether or not they have previously posted preprints – and will facilitate continued high-quality science communication to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s May and many of us have fond memories of springtime when we were in high school. There was some stress from exams and final papers to be sure, but also more outdoor activities, sports, banquets or awards assemblies, proms, and most of all, looking forward to the summer. High school students today, however, have lost all of that. Seemingly in an instant, they are confined at home, with little access to friends, no organized sports, arts, music, journalism, or other activities. Education via teleconferencing is of variable quality and is no substitute for the interactive learning with other students and a skilled educator. Most of all, our students face an uncertain future. It is especially difficult for teens to foresee or plan for a future with the current disruption. Adolescents may well not be able to deal with these multiple concerns, so it’s predictable and understandable that many high school students are struggling with anxiety and depressed mood. Even before the pandemic adolescents had high rates of clinical anxiety and depression. We are facing an enormous mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As parents there’s a lot we can do to help support our teens. Here are some practical tips to alleviate anxiety and promote stability during this uncertain time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a schedule.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Maintaining a regular schedule can provide a sense of stability for the whole family. Teens still have school; many parents are working and those form the basic skeleton of the day. Online learning can be draining so I suggest periodic breaks, at least 15 minutes of stretching, running in place, or going outside (if possible) every two hours or so. Teens with attentional issue may need more frequent breaks.  Add structured time for meditation, pleasant events, and physical activity. Many schools, online programs, and apps can support a meditation practice.  At the minimum we can teach our children to take just a few minutes to breathe deeply as a break from the stresses of the day. I am partial to Dr. Andrew Weil’s simple 4-7-8 approach, breathing in for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and then exhaling very slowly for eight seconds.  I can feel a sense of relaxation at about number five during the exhale. This small exercise is helpful to everyone and can quell anxiety. Evenings might be a time to reclaim long-forgotten family activities from when the teens were younger: baking, doing puzzles, working on family history projects, or even watching television together can foster connection and emphasize the family as foundational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit access to the news. Normally I think that high schoolers learn about government and global issues and develop a critical eye from reading or watching the news. Right now, however, it can be overwhelming to see the stories, not only of death and pain but also unemployment and the plight of our most vulnerable citizens. You can share with your teen why watching too much coronavirus or political news can be demoralizing. Everyone is different, but 30 minutes is plenty of time to catch up on the news and you can add some time for discussion. You can also help yourself and your teen by being a good role model of having boundaries about watching the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help them stay connected. Teens can continue to find ways to relate to their friends even during this time of social distancing and sheltering in place. In the past I viewed too much time on social media as destructive, especially to young women. However, in the current situation, social media can, if used responsibly, provide a sense of connection, shared goals, and distraction. I recommend being more flexible about screen time.  Email, texts, and even writing letters will help (and older relatives will appreciate the letters). In addition to connections to their friends, we can encourage teens to form connections to the larger community. We’ve seen that teens can be creative and generous by volunteering, whether making masks, raising money for charity online or contributing art work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster self-efficacy. In isolation, it is can be difficult for teenagers to feel any sense of competence other than academics. Teens with learning differences may be having an especially difficult time adjusting to virtual learning. Assign tasks at home, including daily chores and longer-term ones like organizing family photos, building a table, creating new menus, and so on.  Older teens can help their siblings or cousins with schoolwork. Ask your high schoolers how they think they can help out; their creativity may surprise you. All these activities help the family and teens still appreciate your acknowledgment of a job well done. Learning a new skill or completing a project also elicits the “I’ve got this” feeling, that leads to improved mood and can foster independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by Anastasia Gepp via&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/girl-teen-caf%C3%A9-smartphone-sorrow-1848477&quot;&gt; Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/&quot;&gt;Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/624410018/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/624410018/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why anti-vaxxers are rising again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-conspiracy-theories-hurt-vaccination-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How conspiracy theories hurt vaccination numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to prepare for death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Feeling Sleepy? Six Findings That Reveal The Nuanced Effects Of Poor Sleep</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/19/feeling-sleepy-six-findings-that-reveal-the-nuanced-effects-of-poor-sleep/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that too little sleep is bad for us. Matthew Walker, a UC Berkeley sleep scientist and author of the best-selling &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, has gone so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p061pxj4&quot;&gt;as to declare&lt;/a&gt;: “The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life.” However, some researchers fear that our concerns about not getting enough sleep are becoming overblown — and that, ironically, they could be making the problem worse. In this feature, we take a look at evidence that “too little” sleep isn’t always the disaster that it’s held up to be.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39623&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not always about a lack of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be familiar with the chronotype concepts of larks (early to bed and early to rise) and owls (late to bed, and late to rise). Most kids start out as larks, but during adolescence, many shift to becoming owls. Waking up late is fine for teenagers at the weekends, but not during the school week. Unsurprisingly, then, various studies have found that delaying the time school starts improves academic results for this age-group, and many sleep scientists and paediatricians &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2014.942666&quot;&gt;support such a policy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been assumed that this is because it allows teens to get a decent night’s sleep. But there’s some evidence that this may not be the reason. A recent study of Dutch secondary school pupils, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, found that owls did get poorer exam grades, but this effect &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/17/its-not-just-lack-of-sleep-why-pupils-with-an-owl-chronotype-get-lower-grades/&quot;&gt;was largely independent of sleep duration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that even when owls get “enough” sleep, they don’t do as well as larks on exams. And this, it seems, is because exams are often administered in the mornings, when owls aren’t at their cognitive peak. When owls took exams in the afternoon, closer to that peak, they achieved similar grades as larks. This was especially true for science subjects. Of course, if the school day starts later, then exams start later — and this could be a better fit for many teens’ chronotype. What this all means, though, is that, in many cases, trying to get teens to go to bed earlier, to sleep for longer, may not make as much of a difference to their performance at school as has been claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause or effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, OCD, ADHD, schizophrenia, PTSD… all kinds of mental health problems are associated with sleep problems, too. It’s now recognised that the relationship is circular, with mental illness and insomnia exacerbating each other. It’s not as simple, then, as a lack of sleep causing symptoms. And certainly, there’s evidence that stress early in life can set you up for insomnia much later. One study found that children who grew up in families with high levels of conflict &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/too-stressed-sleep&quot;&gt;went on to be more likely to have insomnia as adults&lt;/a&gt;. This held even when any sleep problems or depression during childhood were controlled for in the analysis — so it wasn’t a case of participants who’d had trouble sleeping as kids still having these difficulties as adults. And when it comes to depression, the links between sleep and symptoms can be surprising…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A surprising therapy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depriving depressed people of sleep works as an effective &lt;em&gt;treatment&lt;/em&gt;. This was shown in series of studies starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/468269&quot;&gt;almost 50 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. But it has become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549913&quot;&gt;standard therapy&lt;/a&gt; only recently. Healthy people deprived of sleep will generally find that their mood worsens. But for people with depression, staying awake for at least a night can do the opposite (temporarily, anyway). The impacts are rapid, and work on most patients, as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067264&quot;&gt;study in Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has found. Exactly how the treatment works is still debated, but it’s thought to shock a sluggish biological clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; improve memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that sleep is important for memory is pretty overwhelming. But, recently, at least one study has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/22/getting-some-sleep-doesnt-make-eyewitnesses-any-better-at-identifying-suspects/&quot;&gt;challenged the idea&lt;/a&gt; that sleep always brings memory benefits. Given the experimental record, the researchers had expected to find that eye-witnesses who were given the chance to sleep would be better at identifying suspects the following day. But they weren’t…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big study: 2000 participants watched a brief video of a man stealing a laptop from an office. Twelve hours later, they were asked to identify him from a line-up. Half had slept during this time, but, contrary to expectations, they were no more accurate than the others at picking out the perpetrator. More work is needed to try to clarify why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects can be indirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt you’ve heard that a lack of sleep isn’t just bad for your mental but your physical health. Women who get less sleep are indeed more likely to develop obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, for example. But the major reason for these effects seems to be indirect: women who sleep poorly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014587&quot;&gt;tend to make poorer food choices&lt;/a&gt;, going for higher-calorie, energy-dense foods. These choices are certainly related to a lack of quality sleep, but they aren’t an inevitable result of it. The same team behind this finding suspect, meanwhile, that a poor diet can cause poor sleep: “It’s also possible that poor diet has a negative impact on women’s sleep quality”, notes lead author Faris Zuraikat, at Columbia University. “Eating more could also cause gastrointestinal discomfort, for instance, making it harder to fall asleep or remain asleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some poor sleepers don’t suffer at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how bad is insomnia anyway…? There are a lot of people out there who technically do suffer from insomnia, but who don’t believe, or realise, that they do, and these people experience no distress or anxiety, and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/26/insomnia-identity-misbelieving-youve-got-sleep-problems-can-be-more-harmful-than-actual-lack-of-sleep/&quot;&gt;no more impaired in terms of daily fatigue than those who get good sleep&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, a massive increase in hypertension (high blood pressure) was observed among those who regarded themselves as having insomnia, but not among the “non-complaining poor sleepers”. The same review found that 37% of people who think they have insomnia actually sleep normally, and having an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796717301638?via=ihub&quot;&gt;insomnia identity&lt;/a&gt;” was more predictive of daytime impairment than poor sleep. Other research has found, meanwhile, that worrying about not getting enough sleep can itself lead to prolonged insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Headlines that make people worry that they’re not getting enough sleep could themselves, then, cause some of the problems they’re describing. Which brings me back to the start of this feature…. There’s plenty of evidence that a good quantity of regular quality sleep is important. But how we think about the way we sleep is important, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great Recession of 2008 was characterized by an economic and financial crisis with a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), high levels of unemployment, and a great impact on European countries and worldwide. Austerity measures taken by governments as a response to this crisis were characterized by reducing social spending and increasing taxation, although they were neither homogeneous nor similarly implemented at European level; some countries protected public sector programs and systems while others instituted large budget cuts in education, healthcare, and other public services. There was general agreement that some countries such as Greece, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom applied higher levels of austerity. These measures taken by governments would have an impact on the most vulnerable groups, mainly children and youth from disadvantaged families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08732-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;We conducte&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11883 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/financial-crisis-544944_640-300x212.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;d a systematic literature review&lt;/a&gt; to assess the impact of austerity measures taken by European governments on social determinants of child health, and child health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries that applied high austerity levels showed an increase in material deprivation, child poverty rates, and low birth weight, compared to the pre-austerity period. Higher levels of social protection spending in the period 2008–2013 were associated with lower levels of child poverty. High austerity was reported also to be related to poorer access to and quality of services provided, mainly to disabled children. Reduction of public health expenditure was associated with a reduction of specific vaccination coverage in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austerity and COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health in the long run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time when we carried out the review, we had not predicted the current COVID-19 pandemic. Early data suggests, unsurprisingly, that the pandemic is impacting the poor and vulnerable most, with stark socio-economic and ethnic inequalities in outcomes.  Although there are still many uncertainties regarding the pandemic, it seems that children are less prone to severe consequences of infection compared to adults. However, it is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health, particularly poor children, in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11884&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/children-63175_640-300x216.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, key components of preventive child health services have been negatively affected, e.g. immunization. The unintended consequences of lockdown measures and social distancing are disproportionately affecting poor children, increasing hunger, mental health problems and the risk of abuse, neglect and non-accidental injury. Especially, closure of schools and (day)care facilities may have contributed to lower ‘visibility’ of neglect and domestic violence. In the long run, sustained austerity measures to be expected after the acute phase will damage the capacity of social welfare and health systems to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent the negative consequences of austerity measures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the basis of our review, we hypothesize that those areas and countries that applied less austerity measures are in a better condition to respond to the healthcare and social needs of both children and the general population. Moreover, we recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent such negative consequences of austerity measures. In the near future important research challenges will be to see if the countries with fewer cuts in expenditure on public healthcare and social services are better able to protect health and well-being of children and families, especially in disadvantaged populations, from the consequences of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We Think We’re Better Than Others At Avoiding Online Scams</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/18/we-think-were-better-than-others-at-avoiding-online-scams/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some attempted online scams are pretty obvious: those of us who are internet savvy, for example, are unlikely to reply to emails promising us millions of pounds worth of Bitcoin, no matter how often they land in our inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, however, are harder to detect — and we may be overestimating our ability to do so, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2020.1756240&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology &lt;/em&gt;from E. Blair Cox and colleagues at New York University. It finds that people tend to believe they are less likely to fall for such scams than others, and that this assumption can actually put them at more risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39620&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;First, 146 participants were presented with 12 phishing emails, based on real examples: one invited participants to test a new iPad, for example, whilst another said that the user’s Amazon password needed updating. Participants were either asked to indicate how likely &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were to partake in the requested action (e.g. clicking a link or downloading an attachment), or how likely “someone like them” — a student of the same age and gender at the same university — would be to do so. In the first half of the experiment, participants were told the emails were phishing attempts, and in the second were told the emails were legitimate opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also saw “base rates”: true percentages of a similar student population that had engaged in each behaviour, such as “37.3% of undergraduate students at a university clicked on a link to sign an illegal movie downloading pledge, because they thought they must in order to register for classes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the emails were described as phishing attempts, participants predicted they were less likely to engage with the email than someone like them. Participants also showed no signs of using base rates to predict their own behaviour, while those who rated others’ behaviour did seem to use this figure as a guide. When told the emails were legitimate, there was no difference between the two groups. Two follow-up studies found the same results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team looked at how (and how often) people use base rate information to make judgements about themselves and others, replicating the methods of the first three studies and adding eye gaze tracking. A total of 160 participants were presented with the same 12 phishing emails from the previous studies, and their eye movement was tracked as they estimated how likely they would be to engage with the emails. They were then asked to indicate how many times they had looked at the base rate information when considering their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, participants believed they were less likely than others to fall for an online scam. And, as the eye tracking confirmed, they were also less likely to look at base rate information when considering their own choices, compared to when predicting someone else’s behaviour. However, they didn’t seem to be aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, the team suggests, leaves many of us less than secure when it comes to our online lives: if we don’t take into consideration how often people fall for scams, we are unlikely to realise how susceptible we are ourselves. Companies may also do well to take heed — base rates are often shared with employees to encourage better security practices, but these results suggest that may not work. New approaches may be more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also millions of people who don’t have digital literacy skills: in the UK alone, 8% of people (4.3 million) are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/articles/exploringtheuksdigitaldivide/2019-03-04&quot;&gt;estimated to have no basic skills at all&lt;/a&gt;. But even if you are someone who knows their way around the internet — or even if you genuinely &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unlikely to fall for a scam — the results are a reminder that it’s never good to make assumptions when thinking about our own vulnerabilities or assessing our levels of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2020.1756240&quot;&gt;Stuck on a phishing lure: differential use of base rates in self and social judgments of susceptibility to cyber risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the recent release of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro&quot;&gt;Computational Neuroscience installable OS
image&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team
is looking to work on to the next set of deliverables. For this, we need to
expand the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to note that we are not only looking for people that may already have
the necessary skills. We are looking for anyone interested in working in these
areas that would perhaps like to acquire the required skills. We will teach the
skills that we can, and where we cannot, we will involve experienced members of
the Free/Open Source software community to help us. All one really needs is a
few hours a week of free time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for people interested in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific communication, marketing, outreach, and community engagement:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To spread information on the staggering amount of Free/Open Source Software
that is available for Neuroscience to researchers and the community in
general,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To disseminate the progress that the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team makes regularly to
the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To just generally monitor our various communication channels to answer
queries and participate in discussions with the team and users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are still about &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;200 tools&lt;/a&gt; to include in
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, so still lots of work to do here. Some tools related to
computational neuroscience remain, so we are working on those. However, we
want to start making some headway on the next deliverable that will be
focussed on neuroimaging and data analysis. Not only do we need to build
these tools from source, we also need to test them regularly, and push new
versions to our users when developers make new releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also want to provide easy to use containers for all the tools that we
are including in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuro-imaging and data analysis in Neuroscience:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of tools on our list are related to Neuro-imaging and data analysis.
To effectively integrate these with the rest of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, we need more
people with domain knowledge. If you work these areas or want to work in
them and would like to learn more about these tools, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is a
great informal environment to start in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that joining Free/Open source communities is an excellent
way to pick up skills and experience. So, I especially encourage students to
join one, even if it is not &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have first hand experience of how busy a PhD candidate can get, but in
my experience I also found it possible to free up a few hours a week to work on
developing general skills that one may not necessarily be able to learn from
daily research work. So, I also strongly encourage undergraduate/postgraduate
research students and Ph.D. candidates to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;Get in touch with us today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have used electrical stimulation in the brain to allow blind people to “see” traces of letters and other shapes, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blind-vision-brain-stimulation-trace-letters&quot;&gt;reports Laura Sanders&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Using electrodes implanted in a grid on the visual cortex, the researchers produced patterns of electrical stimulation that represented letters. This resulted in participants seeing patterns of light called phosphenes in the shape of each letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers are worried that anti-vaccine misinformation on social media could hinder efforts to fight coronavirus&lt;/strong&gt;. A new report has mapped out the connections between various Facebook pages, finding that anti-vaccination groups, while still small, are numerous and often linked to by other pages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01423-4&quot;&gt;writes Philip Ball&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. However, pro-vaccination pages are not as well-connected, meaning they may not be reaching people who are undecided about vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Their attachment style also influenced how they obeyed orders and even how old they were when they entered puberty, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/dogs-get-difficult-when-they-reach-adolescence-just-human-teenagers&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Morell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/cannabis-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of jurisdictions including Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Luxembourg and several US states are looking to legalize non-medical cannabis. The decision to legalize cannabis however comes with a contentious question for policymakers: What should be the minimum legal age (MLA) for cannabis consumption? While a low MLA can discourage the underground cannabis market, cannabis consumption before age 25 is said to negatively impact brain development. Policymakers, thus, face a difficult tradeoff between curtailing illegal economic activity and safeguarding adolescents’ well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08639-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that there is merit in choosing 19 as the MLA for non-medical cannabis use. We reached this conclusion by looking at how Canadians, who started using cannabis at different young ages, differ in several important outcomes (educational attainment, cigarette smoking, self-reported general and mental health) later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did we do this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada was the second country in the world to legalize non-medical cannabis in October 2018. Ahead of the legalizatio&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11887 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/marijuana-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;n, the federal government recommended a MLA of 18 years. However, after public consultations and for harmonization with the existing minimum legal ages for alcohol and tobacco use, most Canadian provinces set 19 as the minimum legal age; the two exceptions were Quebec and Alberta which opted for 18. Two years into legalization, the policy on MLA for cannabis use in Canada is still evolving. In particular, Quebec revised its MLA to 21 in October 2019 and there have also been calls to raise minimum legal age to 21 in Ontario. Notably, evidence that could shed light on the merits of different proposed MLAs was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do our findings imply?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals starting cannabis at age 19 have later life outcomes that are better than those starting it ate age 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that most later life outcomes are better for individuals starting cannabis at age 19 than those starting it at age 18 but not worse than those starting cannabis between age 20 and 25. These results imply that age 19 is the optimal MLA for cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding of MLA of 19 is different from the Canadian federal government’s recommendation of 18 and stands in contrast with medical community’s support for age 21 or 25. Yet, it appears to be plausible: age 19 is high enough to address concerns over potential adverse outcomes associated with using cannabis at young age while low enough to discourage the illegal market for the underage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings will be useful for policymakers in jurisdictions planning to legalize non-medical cannabis. Meanwhile, in Canada, as the post-cannabis legalization era evolves, it will be important to watch trends in youth’s and young adults’ use and monitor harms over time while ensuring that the legal market is tightly regulated and that cannabis companies do not stray from restrictions on marketing, sales, and packaging that might make products more appealing and accessible to children.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Private Good Deeds That Appear To Compensate For Bad Public Behaviour Make People Seem Hypocritical</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/13/private-good-deeds-that-appear-to-compensate-for-bad-public-behaviour-make-people-seem-hypocritical/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find a clearer example of moral hypocrisy than this: in 2015, Josh Duggar, a family values activist and director of a lobby group set up “to champion marriage and family as the foundation of civilisation, the seedbed of virtue, and the wellspring of society” was outed as holding an account with a dating service for people who are married or in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Kieran O’Connor at the University of Virginia and colleagues point out in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-28138-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the J&lt;em&gt;ournal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition,&lt;/em&gt; Duggar’s apparently virtuous public image was in stark contrast to his private behaviour. This was a classic case, then, of hypocrisy. But as the team now reveal through a compelling series of seven studies, another type of discrepancy is seen as being hypocritical too. That’s when individuals are perceived to use private &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; deeds to assuage their guilt over morally dubious public works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39603&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In expanding understanding of what constitutes hypocrisy, the work has practical as well as theoretical applications. As the researchers observe: “Understanding how people think about hypocrisy is important because individuals and organisations suffer severe consequences when they are perceived as hypocritical.” A scandal that involves hypocrisy is extra damaging for a politician or an organisation, the team points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial studies dug into the circumstances in which we judge inconsistencies in people’s behaviour as hypocritical. In one study, for instance, 317 participants of more than 60 different nationalities (all living in London) each read three vignettes about organisations that cause harm, and people publicly associated with them who acted virtuously in private. In some cases, these private acts seemed inconsistent with the individual’s public behaviour. In others, they did not. For example, a vignette featuring a factory farm that abused animals was tweaked into two different versions, so that an employee made anonymous, lump-sum donations to improve animal welfare, or donated to help high-school students instead. The participants were asked to what extent, in each case, the behaviour was hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that being bad-in-public but good-in-private &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; perceived as hypocrisy. And when  good private behaviour was inconsistent with an individual’s public role, they were seen as more hypocritical than when that behaviour was completely unrelated . So a donation by a tobacco industry employee to a fund for lung-cancer research was regarded as being more hypocritical than a donation by the same individual to an animal welfare charity, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, 409 online participants each read excerpts of similar case studies. As before, they rated the featured individual’s hypocrisy. But this time, they also rated the extent to which they felt the individual was using private virtuous behaviour to try to alleviate their guilt, and completed a questionnaire assessing how praiseworthy they felt the individual to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that good private behaviour that was inconsistent with their public role (rather than simply unrelated to it) made the individual appear more motivated by guilt, which in turn predicted higher hypocrisy ratings. And, in turn, this predicted lower praise for his good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study on 1,275 English-speaking participants living outside the US found that the extent to which an individual &lt;em&gt;successfully&lt;/em&gt; reduced their guilt was important for perceptions of hypocrisy. In this case study, a man who experienced guilt at selling harmful opioids was reported as feeling prompted to make a donation to the arts. When this brought “no relief”, he was perceived as being less hypocritical than when this private act was said to have fully cleansed his conscience. The participants also reported that, in this second version, he felt better than he deserved to feel, and rated him as being significantly less praiseworthy. As the researchers write, “At least in this context, using good deeds to alleviate your guilt was tantamount to claiming an undeserved moral benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work shows that people conceptualise hypocrisy more broadly than had been thought, write O’Connor and his team. It also provides clear evidence for one of two competing theories of hypocrisy: that it relates to perceptions of undeserved benefits (rather than, as has also been suggested, the sending of false signals to others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work is now needed to explore whether more drastic private virtuous actions — giving away one’s entire wealth to fund a new museum, perhaps, rather than merely making “a donation” — might be deemed to compensate for at least certain types of morally dubious public behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers write, “The question of what behaviors will convince observers that a clear conscience does not imply hypocrisy must await future research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-28138-001&quot;&gt;Moral cleansing as hypocrisy: When private acts of charity make you feel better than you deserve.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/05/12/tex-live-2020-update-planned/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This summer, the arXiv development team will begin work on the next major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which will be based on the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;TeX Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; update. TeX is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s update will provide enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team will also use this opportunity to address outstanding bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s new TeX Live release is expected to become available Fall 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Children Can “Catch” Their Mother’s Stress — Particularly If She Tries To Hide It</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/12/children-can-catch-their-mothers-stress-particularly-if-she-tries-to-hide-it/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way parents feel and behave often rubs off on their children. Kids’ own life paths can be influenced by the strength of their parents’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/24/the-quality-of-the-relationship-between-parents-can-shape-their-childrens-life-paths/&quot;&gt;romantic relationship&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/&quot;&gt;how often their parents lie to them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also pick things up as our parents try to hide them, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000664&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Family Psychology &lt;/em&gt;suggests. Even when parents try to hide their stress, the team finds, they can still pass on those feelings to their children anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39598&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To examine how stress is passed on from parent to child, Sara Waters from Washington State University Vancouver and colleagues looked at the physiological responses that occur when parents suppressed their anxiety. A total of 107 parents and their children aged between 7 and 11 were first fitted with ECG sensors to measure the heart’s  “pre-ejection period” (PEP), a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation, before spending five minutes listening to soothing music through headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents were then separated from their children and completed a stress test, in which they were asked to give a five minute speech about themselves and then answer five minutes of questions in front of two evaluators. During the test, evaluators provided negative, non-verbal feedback, shaking their heads, crossing their arms and frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stressed-out parents were then assigned to either a “suppression” or control condition, before being reunited with their children. Those in the suppression condition were asked to mask their emotion, behaving in such a way that their child would not be able to know they were feeling anything at all, while those in the control condition were told to act naturally, as they would at home. Parent and child were then asked to engage in a six minute conversation about a source of conflict in their relationship, a six minute cooperation task in which they built with blocks, and six minutes of free play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained observers who rated these interactions found that parents and children were less warm and engaged with each other in the suppression condition. There was also a significant link between a mother’s physiological stress and that of her child: mothers’ PEP reactivity at one time point was related to children’s reactivity shortly thereafter. In the control group, however, stress was not transmitted from mother to child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, stress wasn’t transmitted from fathers to their children, which the team believes is down to how men deal with stress outside of laboratory conditions. Because men are more likely to say they’re fine when they’re not, while women are more likely to show how they’re feeling, the team argues that children were more used to emotional suppression in their male caretakers and were therefore less affected. However, fathers in the suppression condition did become linked to their children’s physiology in the opposite direction: they picked up stress from their children, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the study focused purely on pairings between a single child and parent, future research could focus on emotional suppression and stress in larger groups or family systems, exploring how a second parent, sibling or other family member affects this physiological link, for instance. Researchers could also examine the techniques that parents use in the control condition: their warm and engaging interactions may stem from specific, positive emotion regulation strategies rather than simply being the result of not suppressing their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding stress from your children is entirely understandable — you may wish to protect them from negative feelings and see emotional suppression as the best way to do that. But, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/wsu-ein042020.php&quot;&gt;as Waters says&lt;/a&gt;, it may be more comforting for children “to have their feelings honoured” — listening to them honestly, rather than brushing over them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: “Being Fun” Is An Important Marker Of Social Status Among Children</title>

&lt;p&gt;When my 9-year-old has his best friend over to play, the house is filled with the sound of giggles. Yes, this friend plays fair, is outgoing and shares my son’s interests. But he’s also good &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any parent knows that kids this age are obsessed with having fun (something that’s in short supply for many home-schoolers right now). And yet “being fun” has been overlooked as an indicator of a child’s social status, argue the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12546&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;. Their new studies are, they say, the first to establish it as a unique factor important for understanding social hierarchies among kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39593&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Within groups of children, social status is fluid, note Brett Laursen at Florida Atlantic University and colleagues. So far, researchers have identified and studied two factors that are the main drivers of a child’s potentially fluctuating status: likeability and popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between the two. Both involve being outgoing and prosocial, for instance. But there are also some differences. For example, a popular kid &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/&quot;&gt;might sometimes be physically aggressive&lt;/a&gt;. This can raise their social status while reducing their likeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being “fun to be with” is conspicuously missing from the list of traits associated with being well-liked or popular, the authors argue. And yet, as they note, having fun is not only intrinsically socially rewarding but could bring other benefits — fun experiences promote creativity, and being perceived as fun could protect a child from peer rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the team devised two studies. The first was conducted on 611 school kids aged 9 to 12 in Colombia. These children were asked to identify up to four same-sex classmates who best fit descriptions of likeability, popularity, and also fun. (Fun was measured with two items: “It is fun to hang out with him/her” and “Someone you can have fun with at a party”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children also named classmates who they thought best fit seven other categories: academic achievement, athleticism, justice (fairness), leadership, physical aggression, prosocial behaviour (eg. being compassionate and caring for others) and relational aggression.  These variables are known to correlate with likeablility and popularity, and the team thought they could potentially also correlate with fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity: children who received more likeability nominations, for example, also tended to receive more nominations for being fun and popular. These variables were also positively correlated with all the potential confounding variables, except physical and/or relational aggression, depending on the age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to 662 children of the same ages at two schools in southern Florida, who completed a similar peer-nomination questionnaire to the previous study. To look at changes over time, the team also asked the kids to complete the task again eight weeks later. (Eight weeks might sound like a short period of time to adults, but, at more than half a typical UK term, it’s a substantial amount of time for a kid, the team argues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there were positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity. But the team also found that being perceived as fun at the first time point predicted increases in popularity and likeability eight weeks later: higher initial fun ratings were linked to bigger increases in both these other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their statistical analysis, the team removed the contribution of the variables already known to influence likeability and popularity (such as pro-social behaviour, leadership, physical attractiveness and relational aggression). And they found that the associations between initial fun ratings and later changes in status remained. Being perceived as fun, then, seems to act an independent factor contributing to social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laursen and colleagues also found that higher likeability and popularity scores at the first time point were linked to higher fun scores at the second, “suggesting that, in the eyes of peers, fun begets status and status begets fun”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t explore what makes for a fun kid. But the team suggests that such children are equipped with a “constellation of traits”. They are likely socially adept and benefit from “ego resilience” (characterised by high levels of extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low neuroticism). They’re also probably enthusiastic and excitable, but able to regulate these traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team would now like to see much more work to explore “being fun”. “Anecdotally, we know that children are intensely focused on having fun,” they write. “Scholars should be similarly focused on understanding the contributions of fun to success in the peer social world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12546&quot;&gt;Being fun: An overlooked indicator of childhood social status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“You never write…you never call….” The guilt-tripping mother is common stereotype in movies and TV. But how many adult children harbor feelings of guilt toward their aging parents? Who experiences this guilt, and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five adult children experience feelings of guilt toward their ageing mothers, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 2,450 Dutch adults in 2015 who have a mother aged 55 or older. Feelings of guilt in the family have rarely been measured in a systematic fashion but researchers have long argued that guilt is not only something moral, but also a fundamental social emotion. Guilt refers to negative feelings that arise from having done something that is – or is perceived to be – wrong. Guilt is not the same as shame; guilt is the awareness that one has done something wrong, shame is the translation of that feeling to one’s self-image: the feeling of not being a good person. Guilt and shame are emotions that have been linked to depression and low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have negative feelings about their relationships with their mothers more often report feelings of guilt. Surprisingly, people who have both negative and positive feelings about their mothers have more guilt. This may be because children who have negative feelings about their mothers are afraid that this will hurt their mothers’ feelings. This fear of hurting a person is more difficult if one also cares about that other person. Most people have positive feelings about their mothers. However, cultural expectations about positive and warm relationships with mothers leave little room for irritation, anger, and embarrassment, and it is exactly when such feelings arise in a warm relationship that people may feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult children are an important source of support for their ageing parents. However, even at older ages, parents continue to support their adult children. The flow of support does not necessarily shift from downward (from parents to children) to upward (from children to parents) with age and for that reason, some children with older parents may feel that they are not doing enough to help. Feelings of guilt are associated with a lack of reciprocity in the support relationship. The less support people give to their mother, in comparison to how much support they receive, the stronger the feelings of guilt. With an increasing number of ageing parents in most high-income societies, demand for social and practical support from children increases and this may create more occasion for guilt to develop. It also seems that children who have strong norms about what people should do for their parents feel guilty more often. People set high standards for themselves, which in turn may lead to a feeling of not having done enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was expected that infrequent contact would be associated with guilt but while people who had only monthly contact with their mothers feel guiltier, people with less than monthly contact did not report significantly more guilt than those with weekly contact. That primarily the monthly-contact group feels more guilt fits with a pattern of a good relationship that carries a cultural expectation of more frequent contact than can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In psychological theory, guilt is often seen as a negative emotion that motivates positive behavioral change. This theory can also be applied to the mother-child bond. For example, guilt that arises from not visiting enough may motivate children to visit more, hence, reducing guilt. But guilt may also be reduced when parents exercise moderation in their downward support, letting the stream of support turn more quickly in the expected upward direction, from children to parents. Guilt is not always productive. When guilt arises from negative emotions such as anger and irritation, both of which are measured in this study, it is less clear which productive changes a person could make. Guilt that stems from ambivalence may therefore be perceived as more awkward. Adult children may visit their parents more often or offer more support when they feel guilty, but changing the way they feel about their parents is a different matter. This would require a change of expectations and a change in norms. Such mental and cultural changes are more difficult to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by congerdesign via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/&quot;&gt;Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/623518132/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/623518132/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why anti-vaxxers are rising again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-conspiracy-theories-hurt-vaccination-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How conspiracy theories hurt vaccination numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Who Have Lost Their Religion Show “Residues” Of Religious Past In Their Thoughts And Behaviours, Study Claims</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/07/people-who-have-lost-their-religion-show-residues-of-religious-past-in-their-thoughts-and-behaviours-study-claims/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to people when they lose their religion? Do they start to think and act just like people who have never believed — or do they keep some psychological and behavioural traces of their past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people worldwide who report no current religious affiliation (more than 1 billion) and predictions that this will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org&quot;&gt;expand into the future&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to explore just how homogenous, or otherwise, this group is, argue the researchers behind a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17410-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daryl R. Van Tongeren at Hope College, US, and his colleagues conclude from their studies that there is in fact a “religious residue” that clings to people who cease to identify as religious. “Formerly religious individuals differed from never religious and currently religious individuals in cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes,” the team reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39578&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Why might such a residue exist? Because for people who are religious, the kinds of attitudes and behaviours that go along with religion are likely to be important to the way those individuals see themselves. Picture someone who grew up in a strongly Christian household, for example, with parents who promoted Christian morals, and who volunteered their time through the church. Even if that person later no longer identifies as Christian, these experiences may have enduring psychological impacts. Our social identities &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; change, the researchers note, but this usually only happens slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their first study, the team recruited just over 3,000 nationally representative online participants from the US, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. These people were asked about their religious identity, beliefs and practices, and the extent to which they were exposed to religious behaviours during childhood. Then they completed a (very brief) measure of their subjective prosociality (their perception of their helpfulness towards other people, for example), a scale that measured their social values, and also a test that assessed their attitudes towards God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that a sizeable proportion — 20.94% — of the participants reported being formerly religious. And, they argue, their data revealed evidence for a religious residue effect. On various measures, including religiosity, self-reported prosociality and prosocial orientation (such as wanting everyone in a group to do well, rather than aiming for individual success), currently religious participants scored the highest, followed by formerly religious and finally never religious people. This was true for each of the three nationalities sampled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the team ran a second study on 1,626 men and women from the same countries. This time, there were equivalent numbers of never-religious, formerly religious and currently religious participants. And as well as repeating the steps in the first study, these people were given the option of donating a percentage of their participation payment to Save the Children, and also of volunteering to complete another short survey (they could offer anything between 5 and 15 minutes of their time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who agreed to volunteer for the extra survey, the currently religious gave up more time than both the other groups. Currently religious people also donated more of their money to charity than formerly religious people — but this group in turn donated more than the never religious. This shows that formerly religious people don’t just say they are more prosocial but act in a more prosocial way than never-religious types, the team says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this particular study seems to show that. But, remember, the participants in both these studies were all first asked about their religious identity. If, as the researchers argue, being prosocial is an important element of being religious, then currently religious, and even previously religious, participants had all just been primed to think of religion, and (whether consciously or not) everything that goes with that. Van Tongeren maintains that as the participants were asked a host of different questions, this is unlikely to be an issue. But I don’t think they can rule out the possibility that this inflated these groups’ prosociality scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final study, the team shifted to data from New Zealand collected between 2009 and 2017 as part of an annual, longitudinal national sample of registered voters. This revealed that volunteering was about twice as common among religious vs non-religious people. It also showed that the annual chance of a participant losing their religion but still spending time in voluntary or charitable work was much higher than the chance of someone losing their religion and stopping volunteering. This supports the religious residue hypothesis, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But plenty of non-religious people also volunteered their time. Being the kind of person who volunteers could constitute an important aspect of anyone’s social identity, in and of itself, and so be resistant to change, whether you are religious or not. However, Van Tongeren maintains that the data provides evidence for the “lingering effects of prosociality, even after people stop identifying as religious”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/news-2094394_640-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely no surprise that misinformation and disinformation permeate the communication space around public health events. The COVID-19 pandemic has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/&quot;&gt;no exception&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact, has highlighted how misinformation and disinformation can damage public health response efforts.  In particular, damage to trust, heightened confusion, and intensified discord can widen the gap between effective public health interventions and public willingness to support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about disease outbreaks spreads rapidly in information voids, when there is little true information to ground viewers in the reality of the current situation. While we are learning more every day, there are many unknowns about COVID-19. As a result, the continued lack of definitive information on the virus and its spread has created an opportunity for misinformation and disinformation to take root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research published by our team takes a close look at misinformation during October 2014, when cases of Ebola were identified in the US. We sought to understand misinformation in the context of an emerging, fear-inducing disease in order to draw lessons for future outbreaks or epidemics that might similarly frighten the public. Little did we know that we would be publishing this research in the midst of one of the largest and most severe pandemics in recent history.  The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11863 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/question-3385451_640-300x183.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;First, we learned that misinformation can come in many forms, making it harder for people to determine what information is correct. While about 5% of the tweets we reviewed were false, another 5% were partially true or subtle misinterpretations of true information. While it may seem simple to label information as either true or false, we found making this distinction to be incredibly nuanced. In the process of hand coding thousands of tweets, even trained coders with public health expertise sometimes found that distinguishing between true and misleading information was challenging and required the combined judgement of several people.  Many people may not be able to take the time to carefully and objectively verify nuanced half-truths, instead making judgements based on their own knowledge, experiences, and worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found a strong tie between misinformation and political content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we found a strong tie between misinformation and political content. We had initially, and perhaps naively, thought that misinformation during a health event like an Ebola outbreak would primarily be framed in a health context. Instead, we observed great overlap in misinformation, political tweets, and tweets that seemed designed to induce societal &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567&quot;&gt;discord.&lt;/a&gt; Additionally, both the 2014 Ebola outbreak and COVID-19 have occurred during contentious US election years, and there are indications that COVID-19 misinformation has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalism.org/2020/03/18/knowledge-and-perception-surrounding-covid-19/&quot;&gt;politicized.&lt;/a&gt; An important lesson emerging from this is that public health events, response activities, and communication efforts, while often apolitical in their inception, can be vehicles for messages that serve goals beyond ensuring the health of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found a several different misinformation types or tropes. Government conspiracies, false rumors of concerning viral characteristics (eg airborne transmission of the Ebola virus), and fake cures were the most frequent types. Today, we see these same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/what-can-coronavirus-tell-us-about-conspiracy-theories/610894/&quot;&gt;rumor tropes&lt;/a&gt; appearing during the COVID-19 epidemic. In our sample of Ebola-related tweets, some rumors were refuted, but many were not, casting some doubt on the ability of social media to self-correct effectively. More research must be done to determine the best ways to protect the public from these specific types of rumors and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing solutions to reduce the spread of misinformation and disinformation from div&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11862&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/social-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;erse sources, including public figures, will not be easy. Further research is needed to understand how best to reach populations resistant to traditional public health messaging and health authorities. While essential efforts must be taken by social media platforms to control the spread of misinformation, the suggestion that technology companies should simply act to stop the dissemination of often nuanced and subtle misinformation overlooks the role of many other important stakeholders – and our own need to take a hard look in the mirror and improve the ways that we, as members of both the public and scientific community, consume and provide information to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the discourse surrounding mental health over the last few years has focused on stigma: breaking down those unhelpful myths around mental illness that both prevent people seeking help and, sometimes, lead to outright discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What part culture has to play in this mission is an interesting question. Both the “madman” and the asylum have been a ubiquitous presence in cinema, literature and television, often to the chagrin of those who have had such stereotypes directly affect their lives. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2764842?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=042420&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, has looked at the impact one recent film, &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt;, might have had on prejudice.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39570&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is a gritty retelling of the origin story of Batman’s nemesis, the Joker, inspired by classic 1970s cinema. Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is depicted as having unspecified mental health problems: after his medication supply is cut off, he goes on a violent rampage and becomes the antihero we know from the comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the film was stigmatising was subject to great debate at time of release: in &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;he Guardian&lt;/em&gt; a pair of doctors  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/21/joker-mental-illness-joaquin-phoenix-dangerous-misinformed&quot;&gt;argued that the film perpetuated damaging stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, whilst another piece in the same paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/27/joker-makes-great-disability-art-by-letting-its-hero-bite-back&quot;&gt;described it as an authentic depiction&lt;/a&gt; of someone misunderstood by an uncaring society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether watching the film influenced people’s attitudes towards those with mental illness, Damian Scarf from the University of Otago and colleagues held screenings of &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; for 84 participants and of &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate, &lt;/em&gt;a film with no depiction of mental illness, for 80 participants. Demographic data was taken for all participants, including whether or not they had personal experience of mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after both screenings, participants completed the Prejudice Toward People With Mental Illness (PPMI) scale, which gauges how much the respondent fears or avoids people with mental health problems, and how much they view them as unpredictable or malevolent .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that watching the film did increase negative perceptions of mental illness. Participants watching &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; had a mean score of 2.99 before watching: this increased to 3.20 after having seen it. Those watching &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate, &lt;/em&gt;on the other hand, had a mean score of 2.91 before and 2.88 after watching the film. Unsurprisingly, those with a history of mental illness had lower PPMI scores across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few limitations to the research. Sample size was extremely small, to start: future research could look at a larger sample, and at a wider range of media. The study was also unable to probe how often prejudicial attitudes lead to tangibly discriminatory behaviour towards people with mental health problems: though discriminatory behaviours are included in the PPMI scale, self-reporting such behaviours may not be a fully accurate way of linking perceptions and related actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you think of &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; itself, it’s hard to deny that cinema hasn’t always been kind to mentally ill people, whether that’s in schlocky asylum-based horror films or in less antagonistic but intensely pitying alternatives. As society tries to leave stigma behind, however, it may be time for the stereotypes to be retired completely in favour of the richly drawn and complex narratives that are truly deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01822-9&quot;&gt;Ma &lt;em&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sought to examine the predicative role of the AACS for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and mortality in PD patients.  This study was a single-center, prospective, cohort study utilizing lateral lumbar radiography to determine the AACS for 292 PD patients.  The patient population had a median PD duration of 28.4 months.  One-fourth of patients had a history diabetes and one-third had a history of cardiovascular disease.  The average AACS was 2.0.  The patients enrolled were categorized into tertiles of low (meaning AACS = 0), medium (meaning AACS = 1-4) and high (meaning AACS &amp;gt; 4). The duration of follow-up averaged 43.6 months and there were 65 MACCE and 84 deaths.  It was noted that the AACS was associated with age, PD duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.  Ma &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; observed that there was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MACCE and all-cause mortality in the upper AACS tertile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?  I might strongly consider starting.  An x-ray is a low cost, noninvasive test that could potentially help with risk stratification.  Those patients with a high AACS should have immediate referrals to cardiology for cardiovascular disease prevention and evaluation.  The frequency of testing and the initiation of testing would need to be clarified. Additionally, there is a potential use in kidney transplantation evaluations.  Many transplant centers utilize a non-contrast CT as part of the transplant work-up addressing the site of anastomosis.  Findings often prompt further cardiovascular disease testing.  These CT results could help triage those who needed more extensive testing.  Those with a high AACS might need to go directly to cardiac catheterization for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Whereas those with a low AACS might go directly to a stress test or coronary CT.  This stratification could eliminate unnecessary testing, prevent complications, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more passive approach would be using the information when abdominal aortic calcification is incidentally found.  Then patients could proceed to a cardiology referral or further testing.  However, in this population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, I would tend to take a more active role in prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html&quot;&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of older adults in the U.S. live on incomes that are near the poverty threshold and about &lt;a href=&quot;https://paa2012.princeton.edu/papers/121818&quot;&gt;one third&lt;/a&gt; of older adults in the U.S. report financial strain, meaning they have difficulty making ends meet. Importantly, financial challenges are modifiable social determinants of health that should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults facing financial challenges may find it difficult to meet basic needs. They may run out of food or medications near the end of the month when funds run low. They may not be able to afford housing that is properly heated or that meets their needs to safely age in place in their own homes. In addition to lacking basic necessities, individuals face greater day-to-day stress managing household finances. There is good evidence that older adults facing financial challenges are more likely to become disabled and die earlier than their wealthier peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01553-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt;, published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, links financial challenges to dementia, which is a costly and disabling condition affecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/73/suppl_1/S48/4971566&quot;&gt;10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of older adults in the U.S. We analyzed data collected over six years from a national sample of 5,034 U.S. older adults to identify new cases of dementia. We compared four different measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial strain, education, and professional occupation) to see which of these predicted new cases of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, older adults who experienced either low income or financial strain were more likely to develop dementia than those who didn’t. Education, which has already been linked to dementia in other studies, predicted dementia in our study as well. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31363-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; Commission on Dementia&lt;/a&gt; identifies low education as a key dementia risk factor. However, when we compared education to income and financial strain we found similar results for all three socioeconomic measures. This suggests that low income and financial strain may be just as important as low education with regard to risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11868 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/figure-300x124.png&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are important because financial challenges may actually be more modifiable for older adults than education. Most adults complete their educational training early in life, but financial challenges could be addressed at any point in the life course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many programs and policies are already in place that are intended to support older adults facing financial challenges. Public benefits, entitlement programs, and tax credits may alleviate financial challenges. However, these programs are often under-utilized. For example, the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides money to buy food but only about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/charts/snap-participation-rates/&quot;&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of eligible older adults use the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from this study complement results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1340-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; our team published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, which highlighted the importance of housing quality for financially strained older adults. In that study, we used the same national sample of U.S. older adults to track changes over time in both financial strain and markers of home disorder such as tripping hazards, pests, or broken furniture and flooring. We also tracked mobility over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that study, financial strain and home disorder interacted with each other over time – financial strain predicted more home disorder and home disorder predicted greater financial strain. Importantly, both financial strain and home disorder predicted mobility limitations among older adults, suggesting that both play a role in functional decline. These results suggest that older adults with financial strain may slip into a downward spiral of worsening home conditions and worsening financial strain that leads eventually towards disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the importance of early intervention to alleviate financial strain in order to prevent disability for healthy older adults. Also, these results suggest that interventions should include improving home conditions for financially strained older adults, which may break the link between financial strain and disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these two studies add to a growing body of evidence linking financial challenges, including low income and financial strain, with poor health outcomes for older adults. As populations age around the world, we should pay greater attention to supporting older adults facing modifiable financial challenges. Our research suggests that efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults. Existing resources for food, housing, and health care supports should be strengthened to meet the growing needs of populations aging with financial challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/alcohol-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether we are meeting friends in a bar, eating out, or planning a night in at home, one of our first thoughts is often: ‘What shall I drink?’. The choice in bars, restaurants and supermarkets is often overwhelming, with long menus, details of tasting notes, and special offers to review. The one consistent feature is that alcohol is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018#data-sets&quot;&gt;In England&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of adults drink alcohol, and around half do so every week. While the risk of harm remains low for many people, 1 in 3 men and 1 in 7 women drink above the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-consumption-advice-on-low-risk-drinking&quot;&gt;UK low-risk drinking guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (14 units/week). This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/&quot;&gt;increases the risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing alcohol-related illnesses, including mouth, throat and breast cancers, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11865 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/drinks-2578446_640-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Making alcohol less affordable is one way to reduce consumption &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616324205&quot;&gt;effectively&lt;/a&gt;. However, we are interested in other potential approaches. Specifically, we were interested in whether changing the drinking &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; could influence drinking behavior.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3/abstract&quot;&gt; Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that people are more likely to buy and eat healthier food if a proportion of less healthy meal or snack options are replaced with healthier options. Our study investigated whether altering the availability of non-alcoholic compared to alcoholic drink options would similarly impact people’s choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked 808 adult weekly beer drinkers to take part in an online study. They were asked to choose 1 drink, that they would like to have today, from a display of both non-alcoholic (soft drinks and alcohol-free beer) and alcoholic (beer) options. They were shown 1 of 4 possible drink displays that either had the same proportion of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks (2 of each, or 4 of each), or a higher or lower proportion of non-alcoholic drinks (6 non-alcoholic and 2 alcoholic, or 2 non-alcoholic and 6 alcoholic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real-world environments – such as a supermarket or busy bar – people often have to make quick choices about which drink they choose. Therefore, we also asked half of the drinkers to make their choice under a high time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased, and 48% higher when the proportion of non-alcoholic options was increased. There was no evidence that increasing the number of non-alcoholic drinks increased their selection when the proportion of drink types remained the same. There was no evidence that giving drinkers a time limit affected the type of drink they chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as we are aware, this is the first evidence to suggest that interventions to increase the availability of non-alcoholic drinks – particularly their proportion relative to alcoholic drinks – could support a reduction in alcohol selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many bars and restaurants offer at least one type of alcohol-free beer, this is often kept in the fridge behind the bar, or at the back of a menu, and the range of non-alcoholic drinks is often &lt;a href=&quot;http://nudgingpubs.uk/pubs-and-bars-are-constrained&quot;&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;. These alcohol alternatives lack visibility and it requires greater effort for customers to choose them. However, the market for these drinks is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2019/05/20/How-much-has-the-no-alcohol-category-grown&quot;&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt;, which is providing greater choice, and over time, increasing exposure to non-alcoholic drinks could help shift social norms around drinking these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions to increase the proportion of non-alcoholic drinks available are timely and of interest not only to policy makers, but also license holders and drinks manufacturers. Research in real-world settings is needed now to understand the potential impact on alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: What are your priorities for data sharing?</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/_TmJ9Pc-sTE/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog was written by &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Publisher, Open Research, PLOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’ve been working to identify important problems faced by researchers in the practice of open research. And, to deepen understanding of researchers’ priorities with regards to sharing research data, we’ve launched a new study. If you are a researcher residing in the US or Europe who has shared or reused research data please &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sgiz.mobi/s3/PLOS-Research-Data-Survey?S=B&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;take a few minutes to take part in the survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The results of the survey will also help determine if and how well researchers’ needs are met by existing tools and services for sharing research data, and inform future PLOS initiatives and partnerships – beyond the publication of open access journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers’ experiences and attitudes about sharing research data are arguably already well studied. The annual &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digital-science.com/resources/portfolio-reports/the-state-of-open-data-2019/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;State of Open Data reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; from Digital Science, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9056-8251&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Carol Tenopir’s research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; are valuable, recurring examples. And a bibliography of studies we’ve read, or re-read, recently is included below &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;[1–24]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;So, why do we need another survey?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Considering the results of numerous studies, researchers’ concerns about misuse and scooping are amongst the most common concerns about, or barriers to, data sharing. These concerns are followed, in their frequency, by the more practical concerns about copyright and licensing (ownership) and the time and effort required to make research (data) openly available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In principle there are numerous solutions available for some of the problems, barriers and concerns represented by these findings – from repositories, institutional research support, training programmes, to journal policies and procedures. Yet in practice — to give one example of assumed good practice in open research — today only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;about a fifth of researchers use repositories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to share data supporting published papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Having reviewed this prior research and having spoken with different groups of researchers ourselves in the last few months, we’ve concluded:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is considerable evidence for various cultural and practical concerns with sharing of research data, and growing evidence of how sharing and reusing data can benefit research, the economy and researchers’ careers. But, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;we are less certain about how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;important &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;each of these problems are, and if and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;how well existing tools, products, and services help solve these problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data sharing, research data, and open data are very important at PLOS — reflected in our long-standing policies on data sharing. But there is more that we can do to enable research data sharing and reuse, which may help realise more of its benefits. We expect that this study will help identify researchers’ priorities, which in turn will guide our priorities for new initiatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re very grateful for any time researchers can lend to completing the survey and, naturally, we plan to share data from the survey publicly in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; with my kids the other night, I found myself quite liking Darth Vader. After all, he’s&lt;em&gt; s&lt;/em&gt;elf-disciplined, determined, conscientious, and uncompromising — while also being (almost) entirely evil…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that we can &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/02/can-evolutionary-psychology-explain-why-we-love-to-hate-evil-villains/&quot;&gt;find fictional villains fascinating&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been argued that that’s because we are evolutionarily drawn to understanding bad guys, as well, of course, to seeing the good guys prevail. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620909742&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that this is not the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39564&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In real life, we do tend to like people who are similar to us in positive ways — who are also conscientious, say, or agreeable. But research has found that we recoil from others who are similar to us in positive ways but possess antisocial traits, too — they’re intelligent but deeply manipulative, for instance. This is thought to be because it’s uncomfortable for us to see any similarities between ourselves and “bad” people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Krause and Derek Rucker at Northwestern University wondered if the same was true when it came to &lt;em&gt;fictional&lt;/em&gt; characters, who may not pose the same potential threat to our self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the pair first analysed data from a company called CharacTour, an entertainment website with more than 230,000 registered users at the time of the study. CharacTour staff had identified thousands of characters as villains (such as Maleficent and the Joker) and as heroes (such as Sherlock Holmes and Yoda) and sidekicks. They had also used scales to rate these characters on mini-spectrums for various traits — from chatty to reserved and highbrow to lowbrow, for example. Users could also rate themselves on these traits, using the same scale, and become “fans” of characters they were most drawn to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krause and Rucker found that characters with a higher score on any given trait tended to have a greater percentage of fans with that trait. Strikingly, the similarity effect was even stronger for villains than non-villains. The normal aversion that we feel towards similar, but bad, individuals had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair also found that villains and their fans didn’t share only positive traits. Compared with non-villains, villainous characters had a greater percentage of fans who rated themselves as dishonest, rude, manipulative and selfish. Fiction seemed, then, to free people to be drawn to the darker sides of our characters. (A finding that made me wonder which dark traits, exactly, I might share with Lord Vader…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair then sought to firm up their findings, and dig into potential explanations, using a series of online studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, which involved 100 student participants, confirmed that it was more discomforting to be compared to a real-life villain than to a fictional one. Further work meanwhile supported the idea that fiction typically frees us from the threat of negative social comparisons — but not in all contexts. When a group of participants was told that they were “weirdly” similar to a “super-creepy” fictional villain in a new film, they reported being perfectly happy to watch the film while alone. But as an option for a first date, it became distinctly unappealing. First dates of course involve potentially important social judgements. The risk of being likened in any way to a “super-creepy” villain clearly represented a threat to those participants’ self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a first date is a special case. “Our research suggests that stories and fictional worlds can offer a ‘safe haven’ for comparison to a villainous character that reminds us of ourselves,” comments Krause. This can open us up to learning more about darker parts of the self that we don’t normally explore, the pair thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories might not be the only way to mitigate threats to self-perceptions, they add. Having a secure attachment figure — someone who we know loves us — might also act to protect us from the discomfort caused by feeling at least partly similar to a morally undesirable person, perhaps.  “Although stories were used in the present approach, our findings invite a more general exploration of other factors that might mitigate threat and thus attract people toward comparison with similar but negative others,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as they warn in their paper, there could be dangers here. If, for example, a person were to see a reality-TV star, say, as a “fiction-esque” and appealing villain, “this could have potentially sinister implications for people’s choice of role models.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daydreaming about an ideal life, it can be easy to slip into fantasies about wealth &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; there’s a reason, after all, that “winning the lottery” is the ultimate dream for so many people. The &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of being rich, however, often doesn’t match that dream, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/04/people-who-prioritise-time-over-money-are-happier/&quot;&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that people who prioritise time are much happier than those who prioritise money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220910872&quot;&gt;new study in the &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drives home the message that money really isn’t everything. The team finds that “financially contingent self-worth” &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; self-esteem based on financial success &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; can leave people feeling lonely and disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39559&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Deborah Ward of the University at Buffalo and colleagues first asked 345 participants to rate themselves on various statements  related to financially contingent self-worth, such as “my self esteem is influenced by how much money I make” and “I feel bad about myself when I feel I don’t make enough money”. Next, participants reported how much they felt time pressures in their life, rating statements including “there are not enough minutes in the day” on a scale of one to seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants then estimated what percentage of time they spent being alone and with others (either working or socialising), and stated how often they felt lonely and isolated and how connected they felt to other people. The team also measured participants’ sense of autonomy &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; how much control and choice they felt they had in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, participants whose self-worth was tied to their financial success reported feeling more time pressure &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; which, in turn, was related to greater feelings of social disconnection and loneliness. Participants’ sense of autonomy also partly accounted for this relationship: those whose self-worth was more financially contingent reported a lower sense of autonomy, which was related to worse social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at the same factors on a larger scale, with 940 participants completing the survey. Again, results suggested that financially contingent self-worth was associated with both lower autonomy and worse social outcomes; lower autonomy was also associated with spending less time with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final study, 246 participants completed daily diary measures at home examining the same concepts as before; this time, however, participants reported how they’d felt or behaved &lt;em&gt;that day&lt;/em&gt; rather than in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On days when participants reported particularly high financially contingent self-worth, both autonomy and social outcomes were far worse. Those who regularly reported high financially contingent self-worth were also more likely to report lower autonomy and worse social outcomes in general. These people also reported feeling more concerned about their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already knew that basing self-worth on financial achievements can have pretty negative consequences &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; financially contingent self-worth can lead to higher anxiety, increased feelings of pressure, and a higher likelihood of unfavourably comparing oneself to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study suggests that there are also social repercussions: if we believe money is the ultimate meaning of success, it makes sense that we’ll spend more time focusing on work than we will our relationships, that we’ll have less free time and that we’ll therefore feel less in control of our lives than we might want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the data is correlational &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; the direction of cause and effect may not be as straightforward as this. But either way, if your self-esteem is financially contingent, working towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/29/people-who-try-to-be-environmentally-friendly-by-buying-less-stuff-are-happier-study-claims/&quot;&gt;less materialistic&lt;/a&gt; forms of validation may be a worthwhile long-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220910872&quot;&gt;Can’t Buy Me Love (or Friendship): Social Consequences of Financially Contingent Self-Worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: A Selfish Reason To Share Research Data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/dMBlQCMXynw/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog was written by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Giovanni Colavizza, Isla Staden, Kirstie Whitaker and Barbara McGillivray of the Alan Turing Institute and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS and first appeared on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/selfish-reason-share-research-data&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As many of us adapt to the benefits of remaining connected with our peers and colleagues digitally, new evidence suggests that scholarly papers might get increased citations by staying digitally connected to the research data that support their results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To promote open, reproducible research, many journals have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1629/uksg.463&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;started to encourage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; or even mandate that researchers share their research data and provide statements about the availability of their data in their published papers. These Data Availability Statements (DAS’s) in published papers (see Table for examples) provide a way to study if and how researchers share their data, and if data sharing correlates with citations of research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Previous studies have explored researchers’ data-sharing practices and their associations with citation counts in specific journals, or in specific research disciplines only. We analysed more than half a million papers across multiple journals and research disciplines, to explore the following questions: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Are authors taking up the challenge of data sharing? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Is this beneficial for them as well as for the scientific community? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We analysed published articles from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PubMed Open Access collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to help answer these questions, and made all our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3470062&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;code and data available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for replication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using an automated approach designed for the study, we classified different kinds of data availability statements, according to their main categories (illustrated in Table 1). The outcome is important as statements that contain a link to research data available in a public repository (category 3) are considered to be preferable over all other types of statements. However, depositing data in a repository may be more time-consuming for researchers than other approaches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We found that data availability statements are now very common in published papers. We also found that journal mandates to include these statements are effective, with big increases in the number of statements in 2014 and 2015, when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (Public Library of Science) and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (BioMed Central), respectively, mandated them. When journals only encourage that authors provide a statement, only a small percentage of papers include them. In 2018 93.7% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Yet, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository are just a fraction of the total&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8% of PLOS publications and 12.2% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. Figure 1 gives an overview of data availability trends over time in PLOS journals, while Figure 2 exemplifies distinct approaches to data sharing from two BMC journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The histogram shows the number of publications from specific subsets of the dataset and DAS categories: No DAS (0), Category 1 (data available on request), Category 2 (data contained within the article and supplementary materials), and Category 3 (a link to archived data in a public repository).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Figure 2: Data availability statements over time in articles from the BMC Genomics journal (left; selected to illustrate a journal that had high uptake of an encouraged policy) and from the Trials journal (right; published by BMC, selected to illustrate a journal that has a very high percentage of data that can only be made available by request to the authors). The vertical solid line shows the date when a mandated DAS policy was introduced. A dashed line indicates the date an encouraged policy was introduced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also find that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;papers that link to data in a repository can have up to 25.36% (± 1.07%) higher citation impact on average&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, using a citation prediction model. While our results show that higher citations to a paper are correlated with linking to data in a repository, we cannot be certain this is the cause for the higher citations. However, this result may be encouraging for researchers, journals, publishers, funders and policymakers who are interested in data sharing and reproducible research. It suggests there might be a further incentive—beyond increasing transparency and reproducibility of results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;to authors to make their data available using a repository.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There might be a variety of reasons for this effect. More efforts and resources are put into papers sharing data, thus this choice might be made for better quality articles. It is also possible that more successful or visible research groups have also more resources at their disposal for sharing data. Sharing data likely also gives more credibility to an article’s results, as it supports reproducibility. Finally, data sharing encourages re-use, which might further contribute to citation counts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9980783.v2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;concerned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that there are insufficient resources and incentives to share their research data, and that more effort is required to publish data when publishing papers. However, this extra effort is really an investment rather than a cost. It is an investment in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.295&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;more reliable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and reusable research for the scientific community, and this new evidence suggests it could also be a reasonable, “selfish” investment in researchers’ own reputations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: A pandemic of boredom</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was just the two of them: on a raft, lost, floating off the coast of Africa—the lone survivors of a shipwreck. Years before, struck with stupendous boredom, Hymie Basteshaw decided to become boredom’s master. He read what others wrote about boredom, studied its physiology, and discovered its secrets in the wavering folds of human cells. Mid-sea, he now shares with Augie March his first and “obvious” findings. Boredom is “the shriek of unused capacities, the doom of serving no great end or design, of contributing to no master force. The obedience that is not willingly given because nobody knows how to request it. The harmony that is not accomplished.” Basteshaw is but a minor character—a psycho-biologist, a carpenter, a genius, a “maniac”—in Saul Bellow’s long picaresque novel, &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Augie March.&lt;/em&gt; He offers not a minor or obvious feature of boredom, but a discerning appraisal of its intimate nature. Boredom, Basteshaw tells March, although not in these exact words, is hybrid, both personal and social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current situation is one of crisis, of resources, values, and priorities. It’s also a crisis for the study of boredom. It’s a call to understand boredom both as a psychological and social phenomenon. If our aim is to capture what it means to experience boredom right now—the boredom of social distancing, quarantine, and the pandemic—we can’t rely exclusively on lessons that we’ve drawn from willing participants in on-line or in-person studies. Yes, we are bored with more or less the same things that previously bored us. But we are bored because of our newfound and newly imposed social condition. In social distancing, we find ourselves in an unusual position. Both restrained and acutely aware of the meaninglessness of our everyday actions we are under the threat of a new boredom—a boredom that looks and feels just like our ordinary boredom, but which has grown out of a much different and more fertile ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is boredom most fundamentally? &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-017-9515-1&quot;&gt;Boredom&lt;/a&gt; is an unpleasant state that signals to us the presence of an unsatisfactory situation and which, at the same time, contains a strong desire to do something else. During boredom, we feel both &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02497.x?casa_token=_BCyupis9P0AAAAA:H6yd-UBkp3cjgUwfzp3lxDYk8FMAuT0r0vSbJQmW9VoQewZqlo17-H-V5tZGMHatenq63d23ysmtQw&quot;&gt;frustrated and listless&lt;/a&gt;. We’re disengaged from and dissatisfied with what we do. Our situation doesn’t hold our &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612456044?casa_token=StKmthlMIE4AAAAA%3ATtU3bwoycH54kqiCpwnOM2q2cGhirea80YUGx5oJcjvhJxw24NxB3PQsb5vUTwU91716zdieELpW&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t interest us and doesn’t strike us as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9&quot;&gt;meaningful&lt;/a&gt;. In a state of boredom, we’re moved to think of alternative situations and goals, ones that are more interesting, engaging, and meaningful to us than our current ones. We itch to leave boredom behind and are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/books/edition/Propelled/MG0lzQEACAAJ?hl=en&quot;&gt;propelled to try to do just that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boredom is a problem—a disruption of agency, a deficit of meaning, or a block in our ability to engage cognitively and satisfactorily with our situation at hand. And yet, it’s also a solution. Or better, it’s the promise of a solution. The unpleasantness of boredom, along with its effects on our psychological processes and behavior, offers us a possible way out. Boredom is that disagreeable reminder that we should be doing something other than what we are currently doing. It’s also a repellent force, a drive that could, under the right conditions, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2017.1346240&quot;&gt;allow us to overcome our discontent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I have just described sounds a lot like a psychological state that exists in a social vacuum, but that isn’t so. Boredom can arise out of a perceived dissatisfaction with our situation, a mismatch between our wishes and reality, or even a lack of sufficient engagement with the task at hand. All of these prompts of boredom can be both personal and social. Any social condition that either begets or supports them would be one that promotes boredom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently experiencing a change in social order. Compared to our recent past, the present of the pandemic is one characterized by excessive order. Out of necessity, caution, concern, or fear, we are constrained. There’re real and tangible limits to our opportunities and obstacles to free action. And so, out of this new social order, boredom grows. “Boredom arises when we must not do what we want to do, or must do what we do not want to do,” psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-00161-018&quot;&gt;once observed&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Melancholy and Society&lt;/em&gt;, German sociologist Wolf Lepenies warned us of how socially frustrated agency is a fertile ground for boredom. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2010-15712-001&quot;&gt;Experimental studies&lt;/a&gt; agree that conditions over which individuals have little control can give rise to boredom. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820v2&quot;&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; examining the attitudes of people living in quarantine in Italy appears to confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another element of our social condition that contributes to the rise of boredom. Boredom is related not just to the perceived control or autonomy that we have over a situation but also to how meaningful our situation strikes us. Studies report that perceived meaninglessness is both a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9&quot;&gt;component&lt;/a&gt; of and a likely &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2009.28.3.307&quot;&gt;antecedent&lt;/a&gt; to boredom. While social distancing, we often feel that our actions and activities are lacking in meaning. Why? In the face of the pandemic, our everyday activities seem insignificant. For those of us who are not nurses, doctors, first respondents, essential workers, or actively involved in helping others or fighting the spread of the virus, our actions seem to have little effect on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with the boredom of the pandemic it helps to bring to mind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01245/full&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; of boredom. It offers us a productive way to think about our boredom, for it underlines its existential import. We are fortunate not for this or that experience of boredom, but for the capacity to experience boredom. Boredom—in its non-chronic form—is a valuable tool and perhaps now, more than ever, a privilege. It’s both an affective reminder that we are stuck with ourselves and a call to become more than what we are right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But boredom can only do so much. Once it has made itself known to us, we are on our own. We have to decide how to act and what to do. We can turn to diversions or reflection, act rashly or prudently, give up or stand up, help others or look after ourselves. The possible outcomes of boredom are many and varied.New habits, opportunities, and careers often start with the thought “I am bored.” But so can unhealthy eating habits, binge drinking, drug use, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/09/boredoms-push/&quot;&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hopes that in times like these boredom’s call can be put into productive and compassionate use. To borrow Voltaire’s words, one hopes that we can cultivate our garden: the ground out of which our personal and social existence can grow and flourish—not as an act of quietism but as a sign of resilience and as way to realize change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth a try, even if it is done out of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@rhett_noonan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Rhett Noonan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dark-bedroom?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/&quot;&gt;A pandemic of boredom&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622979590/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622979590/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why anti-vaxxers are rising again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-the-eurovision-song-contest-still-matters-in-2020/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why the Eurovision Song Contest still matters in 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-working-from-home-is-changing-our-economy-forever/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How working from home is changing our economy forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of our most popular posts here at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest &lt;/em&gt;looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/&quot;&gt;whether we all hear an inner voice while reading&lt;/a&gt; (spoiler: most of us do &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; but 10% or so seem not to). Now researchers have found that readers aren’t the only ones to hear voices: authors themselves do as well. &lt;/strong&gt;Almost two-thirds of authors surveyed at the Edinburgh book festival reported hearing their characters speaking while they were writing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/majority-of-authors-hear-their-characters-speak-finds-study&quot;&gt;reports Alison Flood&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39552&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have traditionally thought of autistic people as having “social deficits” when it comes to expressing emotion &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; but this ignores the fact that communication is a two-way street, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/research-on-facial-expressions-challenges-the-way-we-think-about-autism-134053&quot;&gt;write Connor Tom Keating and Jennifer Cook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, their research suggests that autistic and neurotypical people use different facial expressions, and it is this mismatch between the two groups that can lead to difficulties in conveying or understanding emotion. “This is really crucial as it takes the element of blame away from the autistic person and instead proposes that these difficulties are a product of autistic and neurotypical differences,” the pair writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism research is also often conducted without any input from people who are actually autistic. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s beginning to change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/autistic-voices-should-be-heard-autistic-adults-join-research-teams-shift-focus-studies?rss=1&quot;&gt;reports Emily Willingham at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: teams are increasingly including autistic researchers and focusing on studies that can improve the lives of autistic people, rather than searching for a cause or “cure”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/do-peer-reviewers-prefer-significant-results&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic reports&lt;/a&gt; on a study providing further evidence that reviewers are more likely to accept psychology publications that report positive results. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers gave 127 reviewers for a media psychology conference an abstract that either reported a significant or non-significant finding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the lockdown continues, many of us have been left with a strange sense of time, with days seeming to blend together. &lt;/strong&gt;That could have a negative impact on our later memory of this period, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/lockdown-distorting-memories-daily-landmarks-brains-false-memories&quot;&gt;writes Julia Shaw at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (we also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/28/were-not-good-at-spotting-when-someone-has-a-false-memory-of-committing-a-crime/&quot;&gt;covered Shaw’s work on false memories&lt;/a&gt; this week). Shaw suggests staging memorable “landmark” events at home: new experiences which require a bit of effort to create and may be particularly interesting or emotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical contact is an important part of the human experience &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; so lockdown can be particularly hard for those who live alone.&lt;/strong&gt; And it turns out there’s a name for that craving for hugs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skin-hunger-coronavirus-human-touch&quot;&gt;writes Sirin Kale at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “skin hunger”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some parents may be worried about children’s screen time increasing during the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;. But at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/dont-despair-if-your-child-is-glued-to-a-screen-it-may-be-keeping-them-sane&quot;&gt;Amy Orben argues&lt;/a&gt; that instead of worrying about time spent on screens, parents should instead look at what activities kids are engaging in &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; many of which may be providing them with an alternative way of socialising. And after reading her story, why not check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/&quot;&gt;recent PsychCrunch podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Orben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is similar to learning new motor skills, for example learning to play tennis, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance. However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed project will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is being developed by the Biocomputation Research Group (biocomputation.herts.ac.uk) to optimise robotic rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm. This has led and is still leading to the development of a rapidly increasing number of computational models of cerebellar learning, and to the successful applications of these cerebellar models to controlling simulated and real robots. The PhD project will involve the development and application of personalised cerebellar models in order to optimise rehabilitation robots for individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applicants&lt;/strong&gt; should have excellent computational and numerical skills and a very good first degree in computer science, biology, maths, physics, neuroscience, or a related discipline. Successful candidates are eligible for a research studentship award from the University (GBP 15,285 per annum bursary plus payment of the student fees). Applicants from outside the UK or EU are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire&lt;/strong&gt; has been recognised as excellent in the latest Research Excellence Framework Assessment, with 50% of the research submitted rated as internationally excellent or world leading. The Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research  provides a very stimulating environment, offering a large number of specialised and interdisciplinary seminars as well as general training and researcher development opportunities. The University  is situated in Hatfield, in the green belt just north of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please contact Dr Volker Steuber or Prof Farshid Amirabdollahian for informal enquiries.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Here’s How The Online Status Indicators In Apps Influence Our Behaviour</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/30/heres-how-the-online-status-indicators-in-apps-influence-our-behaviour/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In basic terms, online status indicators convey availability: whether someone is on or offline, or when they last logged into a particular app. But if you’ve ever anxiously awaited a response from a prospective partner or suspected your friend might be ignoring you, you’ll be painfully aware of just how much weight that indicator can actually hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new study has found that many users are not only aware of all that online status indicators can convey, but also change their behaviour accordingly. The research is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/04/13/how-online-status-indicators-shape-our-behavior/&quot;&gt;due to be published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the 2020 ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39547&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has already shown that such indicators can inadvertently reveal a lot about our lives: &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/privacy-implications-of-presence-sharing-in-mobile-messaging-appl&quot;&gt;one 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; found that online status on WhatsApp was enough to identify daily routines, unusual messaging patterns, or even who users were talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this further, Camille Cobb and her team recruited 200 participants to answer questions about their experiences with online status indicators. First, participants were presented with a list of 38 apps and asked to select those they use at least once a week. They were then asked a series of questions to gauge their familiarity with the design of status indicators and knowledge of how to control their visibility in apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants were asked questions about their own experiences adjusting their visibility online (“is there anyone who would notice if you were offline for longer than usual?” or “have you ever changed your behaviour because you didn’t want to appear online?”) and behaviour towards others (“have you ever been surprised to notice that someone was online?” or “have you ever opened an app specifically to check if someone was online?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of apps with online status indicators was hugely common: 99% of participants reported regular use of at least one app with the feature, with Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger the most widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many participants wanted to control their online status, and had changed behaviour in order to do so: 23% had changed settings, 37% had avoided opening an app or quickly signed out to avoid a specific person, and three participants deleted an app from their phone altogether so that they didn’t appear “online”. This behaviour was usually aimed at a specific person: 43% had changed settings to avoid a particular person — often a current or former partner — versus just 25% who were trying to avoid people in general. Many stated that online status indicators had led them to feel under surveillance, aware that friends, partners or family members would be watching to see if or when they had signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking for others’ online status was also prevalent: over half of participants said they had signed into or opened an app just to check somebody else’s status, and 41% said they had been “surprised” to see someone online, which in turn led to inferences about real-world behaviour and well-being and feelings around being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online status indicators can be useful: as participants noted, they can be handy for working out when somebody might be available to chat or play a game, or knowing whether it might be better to message someone or call them instead. But the frequency with which participants anxiously checked others’ online status or sought to hide their own suggests that platforms should be offering better ways to meet user needs. Settings could be more transparent, for a start, or users could select not to appear online altogether — an option which many apps don’t yet offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running into someone you really don’t want to see or speak to is an unfortunate fact of life, both on and offline: eliminating that altogether is probably unlikely to happen. But ensuring that users are able to adequately manage their online status may be something apps or messaging platforms could improve upon. Until then, it’s likely that online statuses will be a source of both community and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Children who are victims of bullying often suffer a sense of helplessness. They don’t know what to do during bullying episodes and they don’t really believe anything will change or anyone can intervene effectively. Children subjected to bullying say it makes them feel sick, afraid, and helpless. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety, anger and depression. We know that as adults former victims can undergo similar feelings in the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to my research in the area of childhood bullying, I am contacted by many people about their own bullying incidents as children. They describe how they coped at the time. Often, they comment on how they’ve managed their lives in the wake of bullying.   The great majority have survived and gone on to live productive lives. However, during this world-wide COVID-19 crisis, adults relate that their mental state is similar to how they felt as children. I have received messages describing the reactivation of childhood memories of being captive to someone while feeling powerless.  In the face of the uncertainty generated by the coronavirus, the same emotions are rekindled: fear, anxiety, anger, and a certain amount of depression. While most are doing what they can in terms of preparedness and health precautions, helplessness is once again a prevailing emotion. Substance abuse held at bay has reemerged as a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, perhaps the majority of people are aware of a sense of helplessness while trying to outwait and outwit COVID-19 by using every best effort. It is a helpless feeling to see the numbers of deaths and to witness the struggles in the healthcare system. While everyone may feel some amount of anxiety related to the virus, survivors of bullying experience a heightened degree of fear, anxiety, and depression based on triggered childhood feelings. Helplessness is a familiar but unwelcome manifestation impacting their daily mood. Sheltering-in-place is difficult emotionally in general. But for victims of childhood bullying it is reminiscent of and activates the loneliness that was an everyday burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma is an aspect of this health crisis. The loss of family and friends, and the fear of their loss, is overwhelming. Trauma results when such overwhelming stress exceeds one’s ability to cope. There are three distinct types of trauma: acute, chronic, and complex. Acute trauma describes what people are living through now, meaning the trauma is the result of a single event- the corona virus. Trauma can become chronic depending on the duration of an event; in this case how long people are required to shelter-in-place with all the problems attendant to that (loss of income, lack of childcare, family violence, etc.). Chronic bullying is traumatizing for children and it leads to changes in the brains’ ability to think clearly. At the very least, bullied children worry and their worries influence their actions. They try to hide and they learn to avoid their bullies. They often become worried, anxious adults. For those who endured bullying victimization as children, the trauma is complex. Those adults deal with childhood trauma and its effects in an ongoing way. Now they are dealing with the very personal nature of the fear of the virus as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children can do very little when they are helpless. They don’t have the tools, the wisdom, the resources, or the maturity needed to ameliorate adverse childhood conditions. Adults by virtue of greater years, greater resources, and greater mental capacity are able, much of the time, to deal with difficult circumstances. But COVID-19 extracts its toll despite wisdom, years, or great resources. The virus is an equalizer in this respect. It exerts power over its victims. It is relentless in pursuing a host to control. It searches for any weakness to exploit. COVID-19 acts exactly like a bully. For those who have already been a victim in childhood, this new terror is another bully forcing people to stay inside hiding from its power. In this way, victims of childhood bullying, even with their adult resources, are revisited by an age-old sense of helplessness unique to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults intimidated and threatened throughout childhood, helplessness is not new. It has come back again in the shape of something even more powerful and intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@foxfox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Natalia Y&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/depression?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/&quot;&gt;How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622804842/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622804842/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-working-from-home-is-changing-our-economy-forever/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How working from home is changing our economy forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/quantitative-thinking-during-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantitative thinking during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: The Digital Migration: Lessons About Open Science Arising from the COVID19 Crisis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ksFNRpjhKog/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was written Dylan Roskams-Edris, Open Science Alliance Officer, Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, The Neuro. This piece resulted from an ongoing discussion with members of the Canadian open science community, in particular Estrid Jakobsen, Elizabeth DuPre, Zoha Deldar, Nikola Stikov, Stephanie Dyke, Rachel Harding, Jean-Baptiste Poline, and Christine Tardif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Science Easing the Transition from Lab to e-Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of COVID19, the world is scrambling to figure out how to continue the functions of normal life while confined to a much smaller world of couches and home offices. Work, family and friend relationships, exercise, entertainment, and all the other elements of normalcy have been upended. The effort to maintain productivity (and, to be frank, sanity) has initiated a mass digital migration; a movement from life to e-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a researcher you are likely dealing with your own unique micro-version of the predicament: how to continue working when you and your lab are self-isolated? In other words, how to replicate as many of the normal functions of a lab as possible in a digital environment; a movement from lab to e-lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab meetings have &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/covid19-zoom-lab-meeting/&quot;&gt;migrated to video-conferencing&lt;/a&gt; with relatively little friction; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00786-y&quot;&gt;conferences have gone virtual astoundingly quickly&lt;/a&gt;; manuscripts are being drafted and figures created – perhaps a tad earlier than originally planned; grants and proposals are being written. These are, however, only a small portion of what researchers do, and leave a huge swath of scientific work untouched and in stasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those most able to continue useful work are those who, for whatever reason, have access to as much of their work as possible from home. Pictures of researchers lugging multiple work computers home in order to continue data analysis were common in the early days of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-42994&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-1.png&quot; width=&quot;496&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a subgroup of researchers, however, who can continue work without having to cram several computer towers into the trunk of a car: those who created an up-to-date digital, online representation of their research activities right up to the moment they had to be abandoned. These lucky few, who put in the time and effort to create a comprehensive e-lab prior to the crisis, are for the most part those who already commited to open science. This is, of course, no accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Science and e-Labs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science is, at its most practical base, the effort to (1) create an accurate and well organized digital representation of research activities and (2) share that representation with as few barriers as possible so others can effectively check, replicate, rework, reuse, and remix findings. Even the concentration within open science on sharing physical materials – like cell lines, biospecimens, and model organisms – is to enable replication and follow-on research when sharing the information about those materials does not to allow others to generate them themselves due to the unique nature of the material or an inability to make materials locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers who have incorporated open, online sharing of research resources throughout their work – sharing experimental designs and protocols, lab notebooks, data, software, etc – have, in effect, created a digital representation of a significant portion of their activities that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to oversell things, open sharing of research resources does not mean that researchers and labs can continue functioning without a hitch in their experimental stride. Much of the actual physical work has necessarily halted. It does mean, however, that many of the inputs to and outputs of their research are available in a digital form; accessible from a couch, desk, or apartment window-sill. While the emphasis from open science advocates in the past has been on ensuring that these digital representations exist so they can be shared, an added advantage has now jumped to the fore: the ability to share your e-lab with your quarantined-self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing Your e-Lab with Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-42996&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-2.png&quot; width=&quot;461&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labs that have, for example, stored experimental data immediately upon collection on open science platforms such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/&quot;&gt;Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zenodo.org/&quot;&gt;Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/&quot;&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synapse.org/&quot;&gt;Synapse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openneuro.org/&quot;&gt;OpenNeuro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://datadryad.org/stash&quot;&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt; now have seamless access to the last bit collected before retreating into quarantine. Analyzing this data may be impossible if the requisite software only exists on a work computer, or you don’t have a license to use it at home; if, however, research software has been openly shared via a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; then it can be accessed from a park bench (assuming a decent wifi signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the collected data needs to be put into the context of how it was collected, perhaps to elicit input from other lab members about the best way to analyze it, there is no easier way than accessing the relevant protocols through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://openlabnotebooks.org/&quot;&gt;Open Lab Notebook&lt;/a&gt;. Need to know exactly what reagents or model organisms were used in an experiment? If one cannot go check the freezer, cage, or delivery invoice, then checking the relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rrids.org/&quot;&gt;Research Resource Identifier&lt;/a&gt; (RRID) listed in your shared protocol or notebook is the next best (if not better) thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of unanticipated advantages continues. Perhaps you need to get input from a normally-down-the-hall colleague about how to improve your protocol for the future, or eliminate an artifact from some data, or iron out a persnickety bug in analysis software. In the lab you could invite them to pull up a chair as you took them through the issue. Now that is, obviously, impossible. If the protocol, data, or software were shared, however, you could email them the link (or, better yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-&quot;&gt;persistent identifier&lt;/a&gt;), open a videochat window, and collaborate from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing Your e-Lab with Your Research Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-42997&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-3.png&quot; width=&quot;467&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most heartening things I have seen while scrolling through my twitter-feed-turned-emotional-roller-coaster is that self-isolated researchers are engaging with openly shared research resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course the case with COVID19 research, where openly shared software, data, manuscripts, and protocols relevant to the virus are being shared, collected, curated and adapted with blinding speed; but it goes farther than that. Every day I see someone in the neuroscience research community tweet something along the lines of “thank goodness for X piece of openly shared software/data that I can learn about and use from home!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-42998 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;1081&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-4.png&quot; width=&quot;1059&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people are cut off from their physical labs and don’t have an e-lab of their own, it is wonderful to see them being able to pick up the tools and resources shared by others. The lessons we are being forced to learn about the fluidity, dynamism, and capacity for collective creativity enabled by sharing research resources will serve us well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sincere hope is that those working with these new found tools and resources take the open ethos to heart and openly &lt;em&gt;reshare&lt;/em&gt; any modifications, derived data, and new insights with the research community. Doing so closes the loop, creating a community-based feedback mechanism that encourages further sharing in the future and, more importantly, uses the expertise of the world-wide research community to create ever better science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefiting the Public and Less Well-off Researchers with an Open e-Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the people involved in shaping (see: arguing about) what open science is quail at the idea that open science has anything to do with equity and equality. They say that it is merely about replicability and transparency and that is it, harumph. What I hope this situation brings to light – as you swear at your institutional VPN for once again dropping you, or find yourself unable to download important papers because of paywalls your institutional account would normally breeze through – is that you are receiving a taste of what it is like outside the gilded ivory tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such restrictions on access and use are what interested members of the public, or those at research institutes that cannot afford staggering subscription prices, or those in labs not well funded enough to pay for the licenses to fancy analysis software, face every day. The act of openly sharing a paper, a piece of software, a dataset, an equipment design, or whatever else is not just about replicability. Doing so is an act that expands the borders of science, allowing the participation of the previously excluded. It is an act of inclusion not in some abstract post-modern sense, but in the very real sense of choosing where and why to put the fences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing Your Open e-Lab with the World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the fact that open sharing is useful to the isolated-sharer and their research community, shared research resources have taken on an unprecedented importance in the COVID19 crisis. Stories abound of how &lt;a href=&quot;https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/covid-19-how-unprecedented-data-sharing-has-led-faster-ever-outbreak-research.html&quot;&gt;sharing genetic sequences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html&quot;&gt;protein structures&lt;/a&gt; have led to the discovery of novel treatment targets, diagnostic testing protocols, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/record-setting-speed-vaccine-makers-take-their-first-shots-new-coronavirus&quot;&gt;initiation of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; on a timescale that, in the pre-COVID19 era, would be unbelievable. Moreover, the rapid release of results via preprints has allowed the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge&quot;&gt;competitions to apply machine learning&lt;/a&gt; to generate yet more insights. Though similar mass sharing has occurred during previous outbreaks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/plea-open-science-zika&quot;&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966&quot;&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt;), the fact that COVID19’s impact has been global (and, not to put too fine a point on it, has impacted the global north) holds the hope that this time it will stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason that the same strategies cannot be applied to the ongoing crises in neurological disorders, antibiotic development, and the treatment of rare diseases, to name only a few. Indeed, the kind of massive online collaboration to solve issues around testing, creating ventilators and personal protective equipment, solving protein structures, and identifying novel treatment targets in the context of COVID19 is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what open science advocates have been dreaming of for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barriers to e-Labs and Global Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science has laid the groundwork for the creation of e-labs and for them to be linked up to enable global collaboration. The COVID19 crisis has, on so many levels, highlighted the importance and promise sharable, digital representations of research activity hold for the future of research. More people than ever are glimpsing the potential that e-labs interlinked into a global digital research ecosystem represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bright future does not, however, come free of complications. Just as open science reveals the potential of sharing, it also reveals difficulties of coordination and consensus. If research is going to be conducted collaboratively on a global scale we need to make sure that shared resources are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples&quot;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt;). Doing so can be made easier through technology and sharing platforms, but what it requires most are education, communities collaboratively setting norms around standards and sharing practices, and a commitment to embed open science practices throughout the research lifecycle. The necessary changes in behaviour will require social and cultural innovation on the part of research communities at least as important as any technical advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big coordination problem has to do with eliminating research redundancies. Individual researchers within the global community need to coordinate so as to pursue different but complementary efforts. Doing so requires researchers to move past the stage of sharing resources in the hopes that those in their community will find it to engagement with that community. In the old, closed model such coordination was handled (albeit inefficiently) through journals and conferences where community members would be apprised of the work being done by others. The same task now must be undertaken in the digital world. Those of us interested in advancing open science are busily documenting how this is being done for COVID19 research in the hope that we can, after this is over, present an iron-clad case for how research communities can be rebuilt with digitally-mediated coordination planted deep in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making an Open Future to Benefit Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would ask you to deeply consider how you can begin adopting open, collaborative, community based approaches in the future of your research, once the world is rightside-up again. Doing so isn’t just about some abstract idea of openness; it has real benefits for you, your lab, your research community, and the world. COVID is, it is true, producing never before seen destruction of research efforts from which many projects may never recover. Within this destruction, however, lay clues to how research can be remade better, more collaborative, more coordinated and, of course, more open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Researchers Once Found That People Believe In “Climate Change” More Than “Global Warming” — But Word Choice No Longer Seems To Matter</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/29/researchers-once-found-that-people-believe-in-climate-change-more-than-global-warming-but-word-choice-no-longer-seems-to-matter/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest political challenges of this era is getting powerful people to take the threat of climate change seriously. The most straightforward way to do that would be with bottom-up pressure: if the people who vote demand that their leaders take assertive action against climate change, then politicians will have no choice but to do so (at least if they want to get into office, or to stay there). The major challenge to this, in turn, has been the lingering influence of climate denialism: disbelief in the reality that humans are the cause of climate change, or in the seriousness of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done to combat climate denialism? Back in 2011, the researchers Jonathon P. Schuldt, Sara H. Konrath, and Norbert Schwarz published &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776&quot;&gt;an article in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Opinion Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which suggested one possible partial remedy: framing the issue a bit differently. They found that 75.0% of Americans expressed belief in “climate change,” but only 67.7% in “global warming.” It was Republicans driving this effect: among this more politically conservative subset of Americans, the difference was 60.2% versus 44.0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those findings suggested that environmental campaigns and policy initiatives might do better if they refer to “climate change” rather than “global warming”, write Alistair Raymond Bryce Soutter and René Mõttus in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376&quot;&gt;new paper in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Environmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; But while some follow-up studies had been conducted on this issue, with fairly mixed results, no one had yet carried out a direct, pre-registered replication. So Soutter and Mõttus attempted to both replicate the original result and expand it to two other countries: the United Kingdom and Australia. (This gave them a total sample size of 5,717, about double that of the original study.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39542&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As in the first study, the researchers simply asked respondents about whether they believed in climate change in one of two conditions — one which referred to the climate “changing”, and one which referred to it “warming” (see full wording below). This time around, though, the researchers found no statistically significant difference between the two conditions (88.8% registered agreement that “climate change” was occurring, while 88.0% said “global warming” was.) That pattern repeated itself in the study’s three main subgroups: in neither the US, the UK, nor Australia did word choice matter. Interestingly, and contrary to the original experiment, word choice didn’t matter among political conservatives, either. One aspect of the 2011 finding — unfortunately — was replicated: in all countries, conservatives were less likely than liberals to believe in climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the generally different results this time around? The researchers explain that there’s no way to know, but they speculate it could be some combination of causes: one is simply that the American sample was a bit different, politically, with more self-identified Democrats and Republicans and fewer Independents and Others than in the 2011 sample (though it’s hard to imagine that having much of an impact on what had been such a giant-sized effect on Republicans). Perhaps more importantly, the 2011 study drew on data collected in 2009, and “[s]ince then there have been major social, political, and indeed environmental changes.” The terms might simply mean different things to people today than they did back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one arguably questionable aspect of the original study’s methodology — and, since it was a direct replication, the follow-up as well — that bears mentioning. Here’s the language presented to the two groups, with the differences bolded by me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature &lt;strong&gt;may have been changing&lt;/strong&gt; over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;‘climate change’&lt;/strong&gt;. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature may &lt;strong&gt;have been going up &lt;/strong&gt;over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;‘global warming’&lt;/strong&gt;. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that this doesn’t capture exactly what researchers are interested in. What matters is whether and to what extent people agree that the planet is &lt;em&gt;warming&lt;/em&gt;, and the first passage doesn’t mention that concept at all due to the fact that &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; word choices, not just one, are different. So a different rate of agreement with the two statements could just reflect the fact that they are saying two different things — the first is asking the respondent whether the planet’s climate is merely “changing” (up, down, up and then down over time, whatever), while the second specifically points out “warming”. A cleaner test would have mentioned the temperature going up in both conditions, only swapping out “global warming” versus “climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting that aside, this partially failed replication is compatible with belief held by many researchers: when issues become politicised, people cling more tightly to their opinions. It could be that word choice matters more for issues that don’t have much of a bearing on someone’s ideological or social allegiances. But once an idea becomes politicised, it feels threatening to have the ‘wrong’ view on it, which suggests subtle matters like word choice likely matter less. And climate change (or global warming, if you like) has certainly become more politicised since 2009, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which suggests that something as minor as word choice is rarely going to nudge people’s beliefs on as contentious an issue as this one.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and Iowa State University Library announce APC-free Open Access publishing agreement</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/tcJvthsc404/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, April 29, at 9am Pacific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Iowa State University Library and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to continue our support for Open Access publishing with PLOS under this new agreement,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communications and Collections at Iowa State University. “Preserving and growing the diversity of scholarly publishers has never been more important, and this agreement reaffirms our commitment to seeing that pure Open Access publishers like PLOS thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Iowa State University Library will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. Iowa State researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS’ mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agreement with Iowa State University Library is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreement with the University of California,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, that's true. But he was loving and kind and selfless until the very end. He was a wonderful companion, and a great source of comfort to me (especially after my partner died in &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/10/there-is-giant-hole-where-my-heart-used.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;There is a Giant Hole Where My Heart Used To Be&quot;&gt;October 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RFzHBt8_K0w/XqdZn2GFiTI/AAAAAAAANF0/heSg-jD9wWMsBgr-17rhLks3qK7XnHeCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Band%2BSandra_Feb%2B2%252C%2B2017.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RFzHBt8_K0w/XqdZn2GFiTI/AAAAAAAANF0/heSg-jD9wWMsBgr-17rhLks3qK7XnHeCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Band%2BSandra_Feb%2B2%252C%2B2017.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Max and Sandra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feb. 2, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was cherished by previous caretakers and human friends, who showered him with gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zL5a8mSti78/Xqdg0KaL9bI/AAAAAAAANGA/w7ySM4f4JNAnxLjQjy8tPRocE3mNZUbZQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2BChristmas%2BEve_2017.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;534&quot; data-original-width=&quot;704&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zL5a8mSti78/Xqdg0KaL9bI/AAAAAAAANGA/w7ySM4f4JNAnxLjQjy8tPRocE3mNZUbZQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2BChristmas%2BEve_2017.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christmas Eve, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2yg4pi2xjLs/XqdhFFEI6uI/AAAAAAAANGI/I2vdJ-7DzKUbGo0atwbHIdMO2SKJ1XHwgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Band%2Bhis%2Bcatnip%2Bbanana.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;432&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2yg4pi2xjLs/XqdhFFEI6uI/AAAAAAAANGI/I2vdJ-7DzKUbGo0atwbHIdMO2SKJ1XHwgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Max%2Band%2Bhis%2Bcatnip%2Bbanana.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christmas Day, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now he's gone and life continues, filled with acrimony and confusion and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trumps-first-deepfake/610750/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Very Real Threat of Trump’s Deepfake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by David Frum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading this article in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;, I was immediately struck by how a cat could hold human values and respect human life to a greater extent than the President of the United States. Sounds absurd, doesn't it? But not really. Not any more. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trumps-first-deepfake/610750/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;April 26, 2020, was an especially manic day in the presidency of  Donald Trump.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  something was gnawing at him. Perhaps his  business troubles were weighing on him.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  Or perhaps Trump was still seething at the widespread  ridicule of his press conference of April 23, when he suggested using  disinfectant “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahcpr/status/1253474772702429189&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;you must watch this parody by Sarah Cooper&quot;&gt;by injection&lt;/a&gt;.” Or perhaps something else had shifted his  mood from its usual setting of &lt;i&gt;seething aggrievement&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;frothing fury&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever  the cause, between early afternoon and near 9 o’clock eastern time,  Trump fired off a sequence of crazy-even-for-him tweets and retweets. He  demanded that reporters be stripped of the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Noble prizes”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; they had  supposedly been awarded for their reporting on Trump scandals,  apparently conflating them with the Pulitzers—and then pretended that  his misspelling of &lt;i&gt;Nobel&lt;/i&gt; had been intentional.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  He retweeted an increasingly wild and weird range of  supporters’ Twitter accounts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trump shows no compassion for the suffering around him, no sympathy for the families devastated by the loss of their loved ones, and only hollow praise for the health care workers, the bus drivers, the home delivery drivers, the grocery store clerks, and the sanitation workers who put their lives on the line every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eternal optimists say “we're all in this together” while sitting at home on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;oh boo hoo, 'Zoom Fatigue'&quot;&gt;Zoom meetings&lt;/a&gt;, placing endless orders on Amazon, and fretting about their sourdough starter. I'm only marginally better, but I realize I'm privileged. {I've tried to help financially &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contributing to homeless organizations, a fund for unemployed hourly workers, bookstores, museums, etc.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And obviously I'm way more pessimistic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this rant honor my cat??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case History &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max was diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma in August 2019 at the age of 16. He also had a murky ailment that made it difficult for him to eat (“his tongue is inflamed” or later, “he has a mass at the base of his tongue”), but the true cause was never confirmed. He was prescribed oral chemotherapy pills three times a week and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/steroid-treatment-long-term-effects-in-cats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oral steroid&lt;/a&gt; (prednisolone syrup) twice daily. I declined the chemo pills, opting for quality of life for both of us. Max's oral steroid became unworkable after four doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not fair, especially after my wife suffered through Stage 4 cancer for a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another vet started bimonthly / monthly injections of Depo-Medrol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/methyl-prednisolone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;methyl prednisolone&lt;/a&gt;) to reduce the inflammation in his mouth, and as a partial treatment for his lymphoma. It worked wonders (for a while). He ran up and down stairs, played with his toys, and jumped over the red chair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started getting worse in January. His weight was down to 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg), a 2 lb loss in two months. He was prescribed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buprenorphine&lt;/a&gt; as needed for pain and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/mirataz-mirtazapine-transdermal-ointment-veterinarians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Ha! mirtazapine is an antidepressant for humans that causes -- you guessed it -- weight gain&quot;&gt;transdermal mirtazapine&lt;/a&gt; as an appetite stimulant. My quest for palatable foods became more and more challenging. I spent hours walking the aisles of pet superstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;405&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDENDUM (April 28, 2020):&lt;/b&gt; How could I forget his stint on an all-chicken diet (KFC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; no skin of course &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or grocery store roasted chicken), which he enjoyed for a few weeks until he could no longer eat chicken... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His last regular appointment was March 9. And then the shelter-in-place orders were issued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pet Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max's condition was getting worse. Depo-Medrol was less and less effective, and he needed injections every two weeks. The veterinary practice enacted stringent measures to protect its essential workers. In-person appointments were reserved for animals showing signs of extreme pain and suffering. Virtual Vet was used for consults and for recommending treatment plans. We had an appointment on March 27. Max was prescribed his usual meds. I picked them up curbside (calling upon arrival) and paid via contactless transaction. I watched a helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS815US815&amp;amp;oq=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.8839j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; and then administered his subcutaneous injection of Depo-Medrol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By April 16, I had grown desperate. The poor fellow was having a severe bout of diarrhea that lasted for days. I tried scheduling a Virtual Vet appointment and called for a refill of buprenorphine. Finally I got through and picked up more meds the next day. These included oral &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/metronidazole&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;chicken flavor!&quot;&gt;metronidazole&lt;/a&gt;, a hideously bitter and distressing medication that made his mouth foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He improved slightly. I was up for hours in the middle of the night, trying to coax him to eat. Some &quot;meaty morsels&quot; and &quot;flaked' varieties were palatable for their gravy. I got out the food processor and whirled them into a very soft format, which he mostly rejected. “But you were just licking the gravy off these meaty morsels!” I told him. Finally I came up with a winning concoction. But this was only a palliative interlude before the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized I'd established a Palliative Care Unit for my cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On April 23, I could no longer care for him myself. I brought him to the ER for severe dehydration. He had blood work and an &quot;incidental&quot; ultrasound, neither of which he'd had since his initial diagnosis. The results were devastating. Anemia due to suspected blood loss from his GI tract. Elevated white blood cell count (no surprise). Emerging diabetes mellitus (e.g., glucose in his urine), a known side-effect of steroid treatment. He weighed only 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most concerning was “free fluid in the abdomen and what looks like masses, possibly lymph nodes and fluid distended bowel loops.”  /  “If he does not improve in the next few days to a week, humane euthanasia should be considered given what we know.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked him up and brought him home. He hated car rides much more than actual visits to the vet or treatments of any sort. Veterinary staff all loved him. The report from his ER doc even said, “Max is a very good cat.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was withdrawn for several hours. Then he got over it and sat on my lap in the red chair, purring. Here he is, as beautiful as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;414&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change in Max from that day to the next was astounding. He couldn't  hold his head up any more. He tried to drink some water but couldn't manage to do it. I don't think  any additional intervention would have improved his condition. I  didn't want to wait any longer and had to act quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate  to find a caring and compassionate vet who made house calls, and wasn't  ridiculously overboard on COVID-19 restrictions. Some said they wouldn't  enter the main living area — it had to take place outside or in the  garage or in their mobile van. But Max was in a comfortable and familiar  environment, at least. And then he didn't have to suffer any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max  was such a sweet, loving, affectionate cat. He sought me out until the  end, until his very last day when he was too weak to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;212&quot; data-original-width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another story of love, and of loss.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt; was released today after a full six
months of development. There are a lot of improvements and new changes included
in this release. You can read the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-32-2/&quot;&gt;announcement here&lt;/a&gt; and the complete
release notes &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release is particularly exciting for the NeuroFedora team. It also marks
the first release of our first deliverable: the CompNeuro Lab ISO image! The
aim of developing such ready to install ISO images that are packed with the
necessary tools is to enable users to quickly set up their computers and get
down to work, instead of wasting precious time and effort on installing tools
individually by hand. While we hope that this will enable researchers by
providing them easy access to Free/Open Source research tools, we also hope
that the platform will serve as a teaching aid in Computational Neuroscience
courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Applications featured in the CompNeuro ISO image.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/20200428-neurofedora-featured.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This CompNeuro release includes a number of modelling related tools that we
were able to package over the release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://moose.ncbs.res.in/&quot;&gt;MOOSE&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nest-simulator.org/&quot;&gt;NEST simulator&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tools have been built with the current best practices in Software
Development in mind---this is mandated by the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/&quot;&gt;Fedora community's software
packaging guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to
modelling tools, the ISO image also includes multiple tools used in analysis of
data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the complete &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scipy.org/&quot;&gt;Python science stack&lt;/a&gt;: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, SymPy, and Pandas,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.r-project.org/&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://julialang.org/&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/&quot;&gt;GNU Octave&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://gnuplot.info/&quot;&gt;GNUPlot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.paraview.org/&quot;&gt;Paraview&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not all, though! There's &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/software/&quot;&gt;even more Neuroscience software&lt;/a&gt; that can be
installed from the repositories. Also, since this edition is derived from
Fedora, users have access to the &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; set of packages that are included
in Fedora: all the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;desktop environments&lt;/a&gt;,
productivity tools, development tools, and libraries that you can choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CompNeuro ISO image is based on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/&quot;&gt;Fedora Workstation&lt;/a&gt; product that uses the modern &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME
desktop environment&lt;/a&gt;.  It provides a clean interface
integrated with a plethora of daily use productivity and development tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/20200427-gnome.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of the GNOME desktop environment.&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/20200427-gnome.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If GNOME isn't to your liking, though, there are other options. You can install
any &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Fedora &quot;spin&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and install the
software you need there also. Whatever you choose, you'll be ready to work in
no time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download a Fedora image,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the tools you need,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;feedback-is-welcome&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback is welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the team's first deliverable. There is a lot of Free/Open Source
software out there that still needs to be included in NeuroFedora. If you use a
tool that's not on our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;amp;tags=T%3A+Software&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;,
please let us know. If you experience any issues or have ideas for improvement,
please do let us know. You can contact the team using any of our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication
channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing NeuroFedora is also a great learning experience, especially for
students. As a volunteer based community project, we learn skills and tools
together and share knowledge freely with each other. No skills or experience
are necessary to join the community. You can find what you want to do, and
gather the required knowledge as you go at your own pace. We strongly encourage
students to join the team, contribute their bit, and learn more about the tools
use in Neuroscience while they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to hear from you. Please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re Not Good At Spotting When Someone Has A False Memory Of Committing A Crime</title>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/28/were-not-good-at-spotting-when-someone-has-a-false-memory-of-committing-a-crime/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our memories are not always reliable. But sometimes they’re rich, textured and vivid — even if they didn’t happen. Research has suggested false memories &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.993&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;often have the descriptive, multisensory elements of real memories&lt;/a&gt;, a fact that obviously poses both interesting questions about memory itself and difficulties for those relying on eyewitness encounters for evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond the question of &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;people remember is another quandary: are we, as observers, able to tell whether someone’s memory is true or false? It’s a question tackled by UCL’s Julia Shaw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00650/full&quot;&gt;in a new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology —&lt;/em&gt; and she finds that not only are we susceptible to having memories planted, we’re not very good at working out when someone else’s memory is false either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39534&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Shaw has worked on false memory and our susceptibility to it before. In 2015, she co-authored a paper that claimed to have successfully implanted false memories of having committed a crime in 70% of participants; these crimes ranged from petty theft to the much more serious assault with a weapon. Videos of these participants recalling true and false memories formed the stimuli for the new work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It’s important to note that the findings from Shaw’s 2015 study have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/15/psychologists-clash-over-how-easy-it-is-to-implant-false-memories-of-committing-a-crime/&quot;&gt;subject to much debate&lt;/a&gt;, with some psychologists arguing that the coding scheme used in the study led to wildly inflated results. However, all videos of false memories included in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; paper were also classified as false memories in a re-analysis by critics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 124 participants saw videos of someone recalling both a real and a false memory of events that had (supposedly) happened during their adolescence. In one condition, participants saw the person recalling an emotive false memory (e.g. being attacked by an animal, being bullied or the death of a parent) while in the other condition, the false memory related to committing a crime (e.g. an assault with a weapon). Participants were told before watching the videos that “all, some, or none of the videos” involved memories of real accounts. Afterwards they were told one memory was real and one was false, and were asked to identify which was the false one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second study, participants were shown the same videos &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; only this time, one set of participants watched the video with sound, one listened just to the audio, and a final set watched the video without audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that participants are not better than chance at classifying false memories &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; about 57% of false memories were identified in the first study, and only 44% in the second. Numbers were similar across conditions: criminal false memories were identified 55% of the time in study one and 44% in study two. In study two, accuracy was highest when participants were given video with audio (53% accuracy) and worst with just audio (32%) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaw argues that the study’s results demonstrate that false memories look real to an observer: even though participants knew that one memory was false and one was true, they were still unable to accurately tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have serious implications for judges, police officers, lawyers and others involved with gathering evidence and interviewing eyewitnesses. Shaw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/apr/false-memories-crime-appear-real-when-retold-others&quot;&gt;points to judges in particular&lt;/a&gt;, who should “never assume they can tell when someone has a false memory … and should consider the entire process to see if there was any risk of contamination of a defendant or witness’ memories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results should almost be beside the point &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; judges, lawyers and police officers should &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; try to assume they can’t always tell whether someone’s memory is accurate or not. So it will be interesting to see exactly how these findings are taken by legal and law enforcement officials.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Teenagers Who Believe They Are Particularly Intelligent Tend To Be More Narcissistic And Happier With Life</title>

&lt;p&gt;Though it may vary based on context or mood, most of us have a fairly steady belief in how intelligent we think we are. Whether that belief is in any way accurate or even helpful is a different questio&lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; — one 2019 study found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/&quot;&gt;people who were happier to admit they don’t know something actually had better general knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, whilst a survey from the year before found that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/&quot;&gt;majority of Americans believed they were smarter than average&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’re also susceptible to the same foibles when it comes to those close to us, tending to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/&quot;&gt;rate our romantic partners as more intelligent than they actually are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how early do our ideas about our own intelligence start, and how do they relate to other facets of our personality? In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;new research published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Marcin Zajenkowski looks at just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39531&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we perceive our intelligence seems to have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976&quot;&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976&quot;&gt; effect on both academic achievement and how we feel about ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Though studies have largely focused on adults, Zajenkowski argues that this is also likely to be the case amongst teenagers, too, where some evidence has already suggested that self-perceived ability in Maths and English is correlated with actual achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Zajenkowski asked 428 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 to rate their own intelligence compared to other people on a scale from 1 (very low) to 25 (very high). Next, they completed a test of objective intelligence which measured abstract and non-verbal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a measure of the Big Five personality traits, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory was used to assess grandiose narcissism: participants rated themselves on 34 statements such as “I have a natural talent for influencing people” and “I will be a success”. Finally, participants rated their life satisfaction, rating how much they agreed or disagreed with sentiments including “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajenkowski found that teenagers with higher levels of narcissism and those who scored higher on the “intellect” personality trait tended to make higher assessments of their own intelligence. These participants also showed greater levels of life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender also played a part, with male students scoring significantly higher than female students on self-assessed intelligence, as well as narcissism, extraversion and life satisfaction. But, importantly, there was no gender difference in &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mirrors what had already been found in adult populations (one researcher dubbed it the “male hubris, female humility” effect). It’s not clear when in development self-assessed intelligence starts to become associated with gender, though studies looking at only slightly younger children have found no gendered difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike in studies on adults, there was no correlation between self-assessed intelligence and objective intelligence. Zajenkowski argues that this may be down to the way objective intelligence was measured: the test used in this study looked at abstract thinking, and  previous research has suggested that people may not see this kind of thinking as an aspect of intelligence until they’re of university age. Teenagers, therefore, may not value it or even see it as a facet of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could therefore be useful to include a wider range of IQ tests in future work. Firstly, this could provide a more comprehensive picture of intellect with which to compare self-assessed intelligence; secondly, it may be a better fit when it comes to how teenagers perceive what intelligence actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effort must also be made by educators and families to ensure that girls are just as confident and sure in their abilities and intelligence as boys. Not only might this increase well-being, it could disrupt negative gender stereotypes as it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;How do teenagers perceive their intelligence? Narcissism, intellect, well-being and gender as correlates of self-assessed intelligence among adolescents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is part of a group of publishers supporting a rapid review initiative for COVID-19 research. We are also co-signing an Open Letter of Intent: a call for all of us in the community – publishers, editors, reviewers, and authors – to help make the peer review process as efficient as possible during this time. The Open Letter of Intent is available here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; , but is also reproduced in full below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Letter of Intent, and related calls to action for the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;research and publishing community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;FAIRsharing, Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;27 April, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new urgency to openly and rapidly share and review COVID-19 research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organizations, are committing to work together on a cross-publisher rapid review and review transfer initiative. With the endorsement of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) we are making the following calls to reviewers, editors, authors, and publishers in the research community, in order to maximize the efficiency and speed of the triage and peer review process of COVID-19 research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To reviewers and authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on volunteer reviewers with suitable expertise relevant to COVID-19 from all career stages and disciplines, including those from industry, to sign up to a “rapid reviewer pool” and commit to rapid reviewing times, along with an upfront agreement  that their reviews and identity can be shared among publishers and journals if submissions get rerouted. Please sign up in this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7MILluJtO9xV2QXznWVd66UQU4puow4wSk7iwLz7iYcykfA/viewform&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on volunteer reviewers (whether or not they have signed up for rapid review) to identify and highlight important and crucial COVID-19 preprints (e.g. by using &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), as early as possible, to optimise the limited time of expert reviewers who are subsequently invited to review the most important and promising research by a journal/platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on authors to support reviewers and publishers in this endeavour by ensuring the deposition of their submission as a preprint, and by working with publishers to make the peer-reviewed article and associated dataset, software, and model available for reuse as rapidly as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To publishers and editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on all publishers to actively facilitate posting of COVID-19 preprints to preprint servers with the agreement of the authors, if authors have not already posted a preprint. This should be after confirming the submission warrants further review. (It is understood preprint servers are also doing their own checks and triage.)  Preprint servers include, but are not limited to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;medRxiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OSF Preprints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preprints.scielo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;SciELO Preprints etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, depending on research scope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on all publishers and editors to consider comments on preprints during the journal peer-review process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on all publishers to ensure all COVID-19 submissions include a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mandatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; data availability statement, if they do not already do this for all submissions. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Publishers should aim to facilitate the stewardship of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;FAIR data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and software code sharing underlying prioritised COVID-19 papers (and associated preprints) during the pandemic by working with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;FAIRsharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the Research Data Alliance and Force11 via the joint &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;RDA/Force11  FAIRsharing Working Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (e.g. providing recommendations to appropriate repositories and use of relevant data and metadata standards).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The scars of emotional abuse are invisible, deep, and diverse; and unfortunately, emotional abuse likely impacts more students than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotionally abusive behavior broadly consists of criticism, degradation, rejection, or threat. Emotional abuse (also known as psychological maltreatment or verbal assault) can happen anywhere, both within and outside of families, and can refer to a single severe incident or a chronic, ongoing pattern. Educators, caregivers, coaches, school mental health professionals, administrators, and peers are all capable of acting emotionally abusive toward school-age youth. That is part of its insidious invisibility; despite emotional abuse being highly involved in childhood abuse cases, it is often forgotten and overlooked. This type of interpersonal trauma is typically chronic and cuts deeply, as it is associated with mental and physical health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, self-harm) during the school years and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with this existing knowledge, emotional abuse remains misunderstood, minimized, unseen, and unreported by many, including school professionals. We outline three things teachers need to know about emotional abuse and three things they can do to meet the needs of students experiencing emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact on the student determines the occurrence of emotional abuse more than the behavior that caused it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no legal or clinical universal definition of emotional abuse. For example, two students with a parent teasing them about their appearances may react differently, in part based on context and relationship with the parent. Emotional abuse would be determined by the impact on the student, rather than the teasing alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional abuse is detrimental to both a student’s way of thinking and feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children create their sense of self from stories that others construct about them. Students may believe the destructive narratives that are told to them. That is, these harmful words may impact students at their core—shifting how they think about themselves and the world, and how they feel about themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are numerous ways that emotional abuse may manifest. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional abuse is not simply hearing harmful words. The context around the experience of emotional abuse are varied and diverse. A student may internalize or externalize their behaviors, or something in between. If a school-aged youth is repeatedly told that she is worthless, then the student may be meek in class. If a student is threatened repeatedly, then she may act aggressively toward others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your emotional needs and your emotional health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educators cannot support students if they cannot support themselves. As some students may constantly hear emotionally destructive words in their home environments, teachers certainly do not want to bring any semblance of that into their schools. Nevertheless, working with students can be tiring and frustrating. If their emotional energy is low, teachers may react rather than respond to difficult situations that unexpectedly arise. Rather than taking a breath, teachers might begin to punitively scold or admonish a student. Teachers need to take care of their emotional needs so that they do not parallel any unhealthy at-home behaviors in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster sharing through strong relationships. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to examine the life contexts behind a student’s behaviors. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with students, be curious about the circumstances in students’ lives that may influence how they act in school. To have a firmer understanding, teachers need to create brave spaces in our schools and classrooms so that students may feel comfortable sharing with adults. Students often regard educators as more effective guardians in violence protection than police or security, which speaks to the importance of continuing to cultivate this trust. When students share feelings, provide positive reinforcement by expressing your gratitude or by giving a thoughtful, affirming response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the laws around mandated reporting, and communicate with transparency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/manda/&quot;&gt;Check state regulations&lt;/a&gt; and learn to whom to report and how to report within your district or county. If and when suspicion or reports of abuse arise, reach out to your school mental health professionals. Encourage your administrators to grow emotional abuse awareness, prevention, and intervention initiatives so that others feel willing to report even in instances of suspected abuse. Openly discuss what happens after a report is made, as this transparency allows for students to feel more comfortable with the idea of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words are powerful, and as such, can be weaponized and wounding. Words can also be healing, spoken with gentleness and justice. Teachers should listen wholly to their students and their unstated needs; let teachers use their minds and words wisely and act knowingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Image by Okan AKGÜL on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/apple-gift-teacher-book-classroom-4958609/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/&quot;&gt;Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622374312/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why anti-vaxxers are rising again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory
representations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This episode of &lt;em&gt;Brain Science&lt;/em&gt; is an interview with neuroscientist Matthew Cobb author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3avdYDa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cobb approaches the history of neuroscience from a different perspective than previous writers. He writes from the perspective of a working scientist with a deep interest in the history of ideas and the interaction between science and culture. This approach makes for a fascinating discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through out history assumptions about the brain have been influenced by both culture and contemporary science. For example, before the discovery of electricity it was impossible to image that the brain uses both chemical and electrical signals to communicate. Similarly, our current understanding is heavily influenced by the computer metaphor, which actually misses much about how real brains function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another aspect of our discussion involves several ongoing debates with neuroscience such as the importance of localization versus network properties. We also touch on the tendency toward neuromythology, which is the tendency to think that understanding the brain is the only tool for understanding what it means to be human. Dr. Cobb reminds of the importance of being aware of the work in a wide varieties of fields include science and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Links and References:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3avdYDa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Amazon link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Cobb &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Complete Bibliography at &lt;a href=&quot;https://theideaofthebrain.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bibliography.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theideaofthebrain.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com/&quot;&gt;http://brainsciencepodcast.com&lt;/a&gt; for additional references and episode transcripts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please Visit Our Sponsors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Great Courses Plus at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER&quot;&gt;thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;TextExpander at &lt;a href=&quot;https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&amp;amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;amp;utm_campaign=textexpander-Apr-2020&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Textexpander link&quot;&gt;textexpander.com/podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Announcements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes out on 4th Friday each month.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The new expanded edition of &lt;em&gt;Are You Sure?

	<title>BMC Series blog: They’ve come a long way – to be confronted with an even longer licensure process in Germany: Syrian doctors in Germany</title>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/04/23/syrian-doctors-in-germany/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Syrian-Doctor-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece or interned in deplorable and dramatic conditions on Greek islands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. This drama painfully reminds us that the conflict in Syria continues to be the biggest driver of migration. Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian migrants have crossed into Europe. Syrians are now the third-largest group of people with a foreign nationality in Germany, and among Syrian immigrants, there are comparatively many well-educated and trained health care professionals, e.g. some 3,000-4,000 medical doctors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/ueber-uns/aerztestatistik/aerztestatistik-2018&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of them have fled their country as refugees; many have been granted visas, as Germany is principally welcoming Syrian doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11845&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wire fence &quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11845&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Fence-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Germany needs Syrian doctors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple: In Germany, a relative shortage of physicians has developed over the recent years. A change in working time regulations and a growing demand for part-time jobs, has increased the need for additional doctors. Like many other developed countries, Germany relies on international medical graduates or doctors to supplement its locally trained staff so as to maintain their health care system. Further, as the number of Syrian migrants increases, so does the number of Syrian patients being treated in hospitals and doctors’ offices, resulting in a novel need for Arabic-speaking medical staff. Therefore, Syrian doctors are able to fulfill a double function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this background, it may seem paramount to make the licensure process for Syrian immigrant doctors as straightforward and as swift as possible, actively supporting and advising applicants through the relevant processes. But in fact, the act of obtaining a permanent license to be allowed to practice medicine in Germany is onerous, lengthy, and can bring about many negative experiences. These can include feelings of humiliation, lack of transparency, arbitrariness, and helplessness. This is what many of the 20 Syrian doctors told us in an interview study we performed from 2016-2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syrian doctors in Germany and their stories: the basis of our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05209-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; arose when a recently immigrated Syrian dentist, began working with us while waiting for his German dental license to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told our team about his experiences with a “bureaucratic”, slow and confusing application procedure to secure his license. We were intrigued by his experiences and wanted to seek out other Syrian health care professionals’ experiences of the system. A qualitative study was designed and we received an overwhelming response to our call for interviewees on a Facebook page for Syrian Doctors in Germany. Within a few days, twenty Syrian health professionals were prepared to share their stories through face-to-face interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being lost in an opaque and arbitrary bureaucratic process: that’s what it feels like being a Syrian doctor applying for a medical license in Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that upon arrival in Germany, Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One physician explained: “&lt;em&gt;When I started applying for the temporary license … some rules changed and the authorities were now requiring a C1 course in medical German to obtain the temporary license! After I started the C1 language course, they required the exam for medical terms. When we completed one step, they asked for another step…nothing is stable here.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewees describe a Kafkaesque system where they feel at the mercy of Government employees and reviewers who ask for absurd and impossible accomplishments, refuse to give information and act at random. This is shown in the quote of another interview partner: “&lt;em&gt;There are no clear steps. You can have two [Syrian] doctors who studied at the same university, finished their studies in the same year, – and then one of them can obtain the approbation without any exam, and the other one will need to take another exam. At the end of the day, only one person makes the decision about you. …And of course, we cannot meet this person or talk with them. We don’t even know their name.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11846&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Admin work&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11846&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/pexels-photo-52608-300x201.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair with the medical license application process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair. As informational and practical support from official institutions was scarce, the Syrian doctors relied on personal networks and peers to understand the requirements and find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain a balanced view of the licensure process and the interactions involved, future research should explore the perspective of the administrative staff in the German Chamber of Physicians or job centers as well. Naturally, these regulative bodies were not prepared for the large number of migrant doctors applying for a license and were surprised by the abrupt rise in the number of licensure procedures. Journalists have reported that ratifying Syrian diplomas may be difficult because in some cases, fraudulent documents have been provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/innenministerium-warnt-falsche-zeugnisse-und-diplome-fluechtlinge-koennen-im-libanon-antragspakete-kaufen_id_5066196.html&quot;&gt;[3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/europe/germany-refugees-doctors.html&quot;&gt;4]&lt;/a&gt;. For the medical profession, in particular, credentials and certificates should be checked thoroughly and carefully. Nevertheless, Germany may learn from other countries such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, which have harmonized and simplified assessment procedures for overseas-trained doctors, and implemented specific resources guiding and supporting foreign health professionals in different stages of their application process &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/8/nationally-consistent-assessment-international-medical-graduates&quot;&gt;[5&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-016-0135-6&quot;&gt;6]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming Syrian doctors in Germany is more important than ever – especially as the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for skilled medical staff in hospitals. While German authorities claim to be making an effort to find as many helping hands as possible to cope with the impending shortage of health care professionals, there are no signs that the accreditation process of foreign doctors – Syrian doctors among them – may be accelerated, or handled in a more pragmatic way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/despite-coronavirus-foreign-doctors-struggle-to-get-degrees-recognized-in-germany/a-52966674&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/chaos-485491_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early 2000’s there has been growing interest in the phenomenon of household chaos and how it impacts on the well-being and development of children. Yet despite this interest, no review has been conducted that comprehensively brings the existing literature together. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08587-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;systematic scoping review&lt;/a&gt; we have published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aims to address this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What we found&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With remarkable consistency, increased chaos in a child’s home, defined as high levels of background noise (e.g. from TV), constant rushing, and environmental commotion and confusion, negatively impacted on almost every child outcome investigated, from cognitive and academic performance, to stress physiology, and socio-emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chaos and parenting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how could household chaos have such far-ranging implications for the well-being of children? An important clue lies in the relationship between chaos and parenting behaviors. We found that, yet again with remarkable consistency, greater chaos was associated with increased parent-child conflict, reduced closeness in the parent-child relationship, less supportive parenting practices, and less responsive parenting. And as research has confirmed, the quality of the parent-child relationship is intricately linked to the well-being of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Slowing down childhood&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11837 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/children-403583_640-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Improving child well-being by slowing down the lives of children is not a new concept. Outside academia a number of groups and social movements advocate for the realignment of family time with the ‘pace of childhood’ – a pace that is much slower than the pace of the hurried, modern world children find themselves in. These approaches encourage simplification of a child’s life, through the paring back of unnecessary activities, toys, and digital media, in addition to the promotion of daily rhythms and routines known to support well-being. In short, the focus shifts away from activities that disrupt the flow of family life, and instead focuses on activities that promote parent-child communication and free play (but not computer games!), and support development of warm relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research gaps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite a push from outside academia to simplify the lives of children, and evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies linking chaos with poor child outcomes, we still don’t know whether reducing household chaos will have a positive impact. We also don’t know how to reduce chaos, as no studies have attempted to do this. And importantly, it still remains to be seen whether we can go too far in the other direction, resulting in a home environment that is overly structured and controlled, to the point that it lacks warmth and the opportunity for supportive and caring parent-child relationships to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Household chaos in the time of COVID-19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of undertaking the review, we could not have predicted the situation we currently find &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11838&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/table-3281047_640-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;ourselves in. Children around the world are spending an unprecedented amount of time at home. While we don’t know whether children living in low-chaos households will fare better, intuitively, we might expect they will. These children will likely have greater opportunities to complete their home-schooling tasks in a less distracting environment. They will also likely have more time dedicated to free, non-screen based play – the kind of play that supports their emotional well-being and development. And perhaps most importantly, there is the chance that they will have greater exposure to supportive and positive parenting practices. As such, lower household chaos in the time of COVID-19 may provide an environment more conducive to the promotion of resilience and child well-being. A unique opportunity has thus presented itself to investigate not only how low levels of chaos protect children from exposure to adversity, but also whether we can effectively reduce household chaos levels to promote better outcomes across the board for our children.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>xcorr.net: An online summer school for computational neuroscience</title>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2020/04/21/an-online-summer-school-for-computational-neuroscience/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Megan Peters, Konrad Kording and the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuromatch.io/&quot;&gt;neuromatch&lt;/a&gt; are building an online summer school for computational neuroscience (July 13 – 31st). If you’re reading this blog – chances are you should be a student in this class or a TA. It’s going to be awesome! 3 straight weeks of computational neuro education. Designed for PhD student or postdoc experimentalists in mind, what sets it apart is matching, the same technology behind neuromatch. Become part of small tight-knit group of trainees with similar interests – bond, share, learn. But wait, there’s more:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low TA to student ratio (6-10)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lectures with world-class computational neuroscientists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tutorials in Python, cloud-based in Google Colab: take your theoretical knowledge and apply to your own data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inclusive: 100$ tuition (waivable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I loved summer school (CSHL computational neuroscience: vision). I made some life-long friends and have memories to last a lifetime. We want it to be better than a real-life summer school. Better by being more inclusive, matching you with more diverse people, offering multiple levels of support, and being accessible to people at different stages in their career.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HQC_UMT8BZBpPwbkID5l8pNOVKaSMzzz0xP2_xd0No/&quot;&gt;Syllabus is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen1oyFWIQ38vlBSxUdlWU4AwQ_UYGqQZcGAS_cEmMdN6cdNw/viewform&quot;&gt;Student form is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4aL49WV_dnt7WlXjEwsY8Mb30I2E0VHa8LROYPcmmwkzLdw/viewform&quot;&gt;TA form is here&lt;/a&gt;. YOU HAVE UNTIL APRIL 27 TO SIGN UP, DO IT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Teaching at scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most real-life elite education is expensive and exclusive. In online education, it’s possible to scale to huge audiences for a fraction of the cost, and let everybody in – including people of disadvantaged backgrounds. MOOCs can have excellent learning materials – better production values, materials that resist the test of time, scannable lectures. Training educators in the latest methods can be done at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantage of MOOCs is high attrition – up to 95% of people that sign up for MOOCs drop out. New models are appearing that have the accessibility of online learning and the critical social component of real-life learning. At Stanford, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami started Code in Place, an effort to bring CS education to people at home during covid19 times. It’s a massive effort – 8,000 students from all over the world accompanied by 800 section leaders (including me!). Several factors have kept dropout to a minimum (&amp;lt; 20% after 2 weeks):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A low TA-to-student ratio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;matching TAs to students based on learner characteristic (age, location)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a very high standard for TAs (Top affiliations are Stanford, Google and MIT)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a tough preparatory assignment to make sure the students entering class were motivated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was very excited when Konrad announced that they were working on a summer school, fresh off my Code in Place experience, so I contacted him and have joined the team to help (in a small way) organize this thing. There are a handful of experiments in teaching computational neuroscience at scale, the most successful in my opinion being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/&quot;&gt;Neuronal Dynamics online book, tutorials, and lectures&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine that, plus TAs, your own wolf pack, live Q&amp;amp;A – community. That’s what we’re aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A guest post by Meredith Drosback, Becky Hazen, &amp;amp; Rick Weiss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists&quot;&gt;SciLine&lt;/a&gt;, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEFORE&lt;/em&gt; AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not rude to say to a journalist, &lt;em&gt;“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: &lt;em&gt;“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, &lt;em&gt;“No comment,” &lt;/em&gt;which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, &lt;em&gt;“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: The importance of being second – PLOS-wide edition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/c09QPKkpto4/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be like that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; pioneered an expanded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘complementary research’ policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;wrote about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; eloquently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; policy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;see for example PLOS Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Stands with the National Academies on Continuing WHO Funding</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/nDqUcrlWHhs/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/04/us-funding-for-world-health-organization-should-not-be-interrupted-during-covid-19-pandemic-say-presidents-of-the-nas-nae-and-nam&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt; warning that interrupting funding for World Health Organization (WHO) would be a critical failure for our global health security. PLOS stands with the assessment of our nation’s top scientists: this is not a time to turn inward, but to collaborate for immediate, robust and concentrated international action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt; editors indicate in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2020/04/16/we-need-to-support-the-who-not-stop-its-funding-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;, the WHO is the only global health organization that has the tools to combat a pandemic of truly global consequences.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;To halt funding now would risk the lives of many who rely on the WHO’s essential services and debilitate our collective progress towards understanding the virus and curbing the impact of the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. Despite dating their last common ancestor with &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mimics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of species that attempt to mimic &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobollocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapiens that append the prefix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cranks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sub-species&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Electrophysiologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Systems Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cognitive Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neuroanatomist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioural Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroethologist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroendocrinologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular neuroscientist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurogeneticist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Neuroscientist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Friston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unclassifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

	<title>arXiv.org blog: New mobile-friendly survey results</title>
	<link>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/04/13/new-mobile-friendly-survey-results/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We are so proud and honored to serve the arXiv community who, despite the global turmoil caused by the COVID-19 crisis, are more committed than ever to advancing scientific research. At arXiv our commitment to improving the platform with changes large and small continues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently held a survey to assess new incremental updates to the mobile-friendly display of the abstract page. First of all, we want to extend a huge &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to all of the survey participants. Participation levels were high and we really value your time and your insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our survey we asked participants to review the proposed abstract page on their mobile device and then rate its usability against the current live page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Survey comparison of the old and new layouts&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-596 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-options-web-1024x917.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the main changes include reducing the height of the header, adding mobile-friendly navigation and search links, and moving the download button. We also made the citations section (not shown in the screenshots above) more user friendly on touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users overwhelmingly found the proposed abstract page style improved their experience on mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I prefer the new style: &lt;strong&gt;94.81% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I prefer the old style: &lt;strong&gt;5.19%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-597 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-barchart-web.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users also provided valuable feedback on other aspects of the UI which we are cataloging to inform future updates. We will push these mobile-friendly edits to the live site this week, so if you access arXiv on your phone you’ll notice some changes on the abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping us improve arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The arXiv NG team&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: The importance of character during war</title>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Vladislav Nikonov&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why anti-vaxxers are rising again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-conspiracy-theories-hurt-vaccination-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How conspiracy theories hurt vaccination numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
