	<title>The Spike: Evolution doesn’t give a damn what you think a brain region is called.</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h4&gt;A cortex by any other name&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*q5dqA14b5EAhZlfAZm7KzQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do love naming things. Nouns are the first words we learn: mummy; daddy. Or if you’re my kids: “digger” and “Bob” (the cat) — because who needs parents when there’s a big ginger cat to play with? That love for tagging an object with a label never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are no different. In large brains, like ours or rats or ferrets, we give hundreds of names to their constituent parts. Some name vast swathes of brain tissue: cortex, brainstem, midbrain. Some name tiny subdivisions of those swathes, like the almond shaped subthalamic nucleus (literally, the cluster of neurons underneath the thalamus). In tiny brains, like maggots or roundworms, even individual neurons have names. (Boring ones like “P4”; sadly, there is no neuron in &lt;em&gt;C Elegans&lt;/em&gt; called Boris).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By naming these bits of brain, we can communicate effectively, we can talk about brains and know we are talking about the same bit. We can navigate where we are in the brain by knowing the names of the brain regions. We can even identify ourselves by the bit of brain we study: “I work on cortex”; “I work on hippocampus”; “I couldn’t decide what I wanted to do when I left school; now I work on the nucleus ambiguus”. Naming bits of brain greases the wheels of scientific communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also a dangerous game. If we confuse the convenience of naming with the reality of the brain, we end up in deep trouble. Because evolution does not give a crap what we call a brain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger is that naming a bit of brain makes us think it is a discrete thing, a bit that just lifts right out, which we can study and marvel at in isolation. But how evolution (and development) conspire to disperse and wire together neurons pays no attention to these names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider primary motor and somatosensory cortex. They sit next to each other. But they appear in different chapters in textbooks. Entirely separate fields of research have grown up around them. Work on primary somatosensory cortex looks at how the activity of its neurons represent touch. Work on motor cortex looks how the activity of its neurons represent movement. These are starkly different: work on somatosensory cortex focuses on its inputs; work on motor cortex focuses on its outputs. They are treated so separately that papers merely showing the flow of activity from one to the other end up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/80903/&quot;&gt;in high-profile journals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these bits of cortex are next to each other. Either we believe that there are border guards who turn away the motor cortex neuron axons at the crossing with somatosensory cortex, and the same from the other direction. Or we have to assume that these two names loosely delineate a continuous network of neurons by the fact that a small set of neurons in somatosensory cortex get direct sensory input, and small set of neurons in motor cortex connect to the spinal cord. Most of the neurons in these bits of cortex neither get sensory input from the thalamus nor project to the spinal cord. They are wired to other neurons all over cortex, and very much to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at this nutter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZK8WIcZ8-EMeYtr1AphZbg.png&quot; /&gt;The projections of the axon of a single neuron in rodent motor cortex. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.85&quot;&gt;Zeng &amp;amp; Hanes 2017&lt;/a&gt; (Nature Neurosci Reviews)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution has deemed it necessary for this neuron in motor cortex to send its output wires, its axons, all over the shop. To the somatosensory cortex. To prefrontal cortex, so that the apparent seat of “executive function” — cogitating, planning, turning things over in your mind — apparently needs to know what your foot will be doing shortly. To the ectorhinal cortex (no, me neither). All over the striatum. And to the other side of the brain — yes, the brain has two sides. We call it a motor cortex neuron; it is studied for how it represents simple movements; but it is not a neuron that sits neatly tucked up in one neatly labelled part of the brain — it is part of the the brain’s sprawling, tangled network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortex is divided up into many different areas. Old schemes for dividing up the areas just used numbering. These numbers have been handed down to us from epic studies by unfathomably dedicated neuroanatomists in the early twentieth century. They finely sliced up brains, stained the slices to pick out the neurons, and then minutely examined the changes in the density, size, and shape of neurons across the brains. Each place where there was a change in one of those things got a number. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The temptation is to then think that these subtle differences in neurons correspond to different functions. We followed that temptation by turning many of those numbers into names: primary motor cortex; secondary motor cortex; primary somatosensory cortex; visual cortex. But in the human cortex Brodmann found 52 areas. von Economo and Koskinas found 107. Hmmm. One may reasonably ask: if just dividing up the cortex by changes in the shape, size, or density of neurons actually tells us something about what the different areas do, how come the numbers of areas were so different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18933&quot;&gt;massive fMRI study&lt;/a&gt; used a bunch of ways to isolate different parts of cortex, and ended up with 180 different regions. Far more then the slice-and-stain guys. Which is right? None of them. Those lovely differences in cells are immaterial to actual function. Any given function we care to name — seeing, jumping, talking, putting our DVDs in thematic order because we’re not culturally illiterate barbarians — engages many areas of cortex, and many areas of the brain — at the same time.The names and numbers are misleading, are irrelevant to how evolution has driven the wiring of the brain to perform a function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortex has names for its layers too. Names straight out of a Dan Brown novel: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and — wait for it — 6. In rodents, some areas have six layers, and some have five because they are missing layer 4. And as the textbooks will tell you, it stands to reason that motor cortex and somatosensory cortex have different functions because motor cortex doesn’t have a layer 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an object lesson in the problems of naming: we could not name a clear cell “layer 4” in motor cortex, because we couldn’t see one. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05422&quot;&gt;there is one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/9/2435&quot;&gt;it’s&lt;/a&gt; been there all along. What would you bet me that it will turn out the rat prefrontal cortex does have a “layer 4” after all — a set of neurons that are specifically targeted by input from thalamus and then connect to other neurons in the cortex without projecting outwards — just not in a distinct layer we can see by colouring in neurons? Evolution doesn’t care that we can name five layers in one region, or six in another. In only cares what they do to keep the animal alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evolution, the brain is just a gigantic bag of cells, wired together. The purpose of that gigantic bag of cells is to contribute to the survival of the organism in which it resides, to surviving long enough to reproduce. Those that reproduce, win; those that don’t, don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a random mutation causes or changes the wiring of some neurons to another group of neurons, and that mutation improves the chances of having offspring, it will likely spread through the population. If that random mutation adds connections from prefrontal cortex to visual cortex; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.024&quot;&gt;cortical interneurons to a structure outside cortex&lt;/a&gt;; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3-rPFu-7YAhVRSsAKHc88AqkQFgg0MAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fneuron%2Fabstract%2FS0896-6273%252812%252900281-4&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2p6o-v_lthY7HSWHGFWdUe&quot;&gt;motor cortex to midbrain dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt;, then it will happen. Evolution will not feel sorry that it’s just ruined another set of textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is just a giant bag of cells wired together. Our best evidence that it is not — that we can cling to our names of all the bits — come from studies where we cut a bit out or turn a bit off. When we cut out area X and we see a “deficit” in behaviour Y of an animal (like tying its shoelaces), then we think “aha! Area X is for tying shoelaces”. No. For starters, we never see a complete and permanent end to behaviour Y. We normally see that the animal is simply worse at doing or learning Y — not that it cannot do Y at all. The brain can carry on doing Y just fine, thanks, just not as well — there is massive redundancy in the brain. Like what you’d find if it was a giant bag of cells, wired together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, seeing that behaviour Y gets worse logically tells us little about what area X is actually doing. It just tells us that damaging area X causes problems. Which on reflection isn’t surprising as you just ripped a chunk out of the brain. The logical fallacy is simple to demonstrate. I am right now going to make a new startling new prediction of how the mouse brain works: the ventrolateral medulla is necessary for mice to learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food. Cut out the ventrolateral medulla, and a mouse will not learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it will be dead. The ventrolateral medulla contains the neurons which control the rhythm of breathing. Cut it out: no breathing. Ergo, no learning. Is the ventrolateral medulla a crucial brain area for learning? No. But by damaging it, we damage something vital to the process of learning. Thus, cutting a bit that we’ve given a name can have an effect on that named thing, and we learn nothing at all. Except that we have damaged a big bag of cells, wired together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more remarkable is when cutting bits out has &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; effect. If we cut some bits of brain out before learning we see an effect — learning is made slower or worse or both; but when we cut them out after learning, it has no apparent effect whatsoever. These bits of brain have become completely redundant. Again: giant bag of cells, wired together — there are many ways within that bag of cells to solve the problem at hand, enough for the brain to just stop using a bit of itself altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people get hyper-excited about finding odd signals where they were utterly unexpected. Like finding that reward changes activity in primary visual cortex. Or finding that sound is encoded in the hippocampus. These are great, interesting studies. But to be surprised by them is to fall into the naming fallacy. Evolution does not know nor care that we called this chunk of neurons the “hippocampus”. It is just another bag of neurons, connected to many other bags of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names. Names are vital. Names mean we can all be sure we’re talking about the same thing. They identify whopping great phalanxes of neural tissue; they identify individual neurons; they let us compare brains of different creatures. But we have to handle them with care, less we confuse the label with the contents. Evolution only cares about the contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And development doesn’t give a damn what we call a brain region either.

&lt;p&gt;Early in 2018, the default reaction to encountering someone who disagrees with you is to place your fingers in your ears. The US government is in shut down following an impasse in Congress. Meanwhile, the UK remains bitterly divided over Brexit. We could all benefit from a dose of intellectual humility, according to the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt;. People with this trait are open to other viewpoints and see disagreement as an opportunity to learn. Promisingly, early findings suggest that it may be possible to foster intellectual humility relatively easily, as least over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33080&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenelle Porter and Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh created a new intellectual humility questionnaire that asks participants to rate their agreement with 9 items like “I am willing to admit if I don’t know something”. The questionnaire is based on their conception of intellectual humility as recognising your own fallibility and the value and intellectual competence of others. Find the full list of items below (the letter R at the end of a statement means that greater agreement is a sign of &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; humility):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, nearly 200 students completed this questionnaire, as well as other personality measures, and then they were asked to imagine various scenarios at college that involved a classmate disagreeing with them, for example over the causes of World War I in history class, or a passage of text in English class. Finally, the students stated what they would think of the person who disagreed with them and how they would respond. A second study was similar, but this time nearly 200 more participants, recruited online, imagined a disagreement with another person over more hot-button issues, such as gun control and same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, even after accounting for the influence of many other factors such as a person’s self-esteem, narcissism, and overall agreeableness, openness and humility, the students who scored higher on intellectual humility tended to think about the person who disagreed with them in more constructive ways – for instance, believing the other person has their own unique perspective and experiences to draw on – rather than dismissing their views as due to low intelligence or lack of understanding. Moreover, those participants with greater intellectual humility were more likely to say that, given the chance, they would try to learn more about the other person’s views, rather than simply argue with them or try to change their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to how much we can read into participants’ responses to hypothetical scenarios. To test actual behaviour, Porter and Schumann turned to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website and asked nearly 200 people to complete the intellectual humility questionnaire before revealing their position on gun control or capital punishment. Next, the participants had the chance to read opinions (written by the researchers but made to look like the opinions of other survey participants) that either agreed with their stance or took the opposite view. The researchers counted the in-survey links the participants chose to click on to read the different views. Higher scorers in intellectual humility held views that were just as strong as those low in intellectual humility, but they spent a greater proportion of time reading views that were opposed to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if we all had a little more intellectual humility? The researchers tested an intervention that they hoped would increase intellectual humility via the promotion of a “growth mindset” – that is, belief in the malleability of intelligence. It makes sense that if you see intelligence as malleable, then you will be less worried about finding out you are wrong or that you don’t know the full story. After all, with this perspective, just because you are wrong or ignorant about something doesn’t mean you are forever condemned to being stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study showed that participants who read a popular magazine article about the malleability of intelligence (designed to foster a “growth mindset”) subsequently scored higher on intellectual humility than another group who read an article about intelligence being fixed. What’s more, those in the growth mindset condition went on to display a more positive approach when imagining dealing with someone with opposing views, and this seemed to be driven by their increased intellectual humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world in which we seem to find it harder than ever to listen to the other side, this research is welcome. On the other hand, it’s sure to attract accusations of demonstrating the obvious. For their part, the researchers claim this is the first attempt to show there is a relation between intellectual humility and openness to opposing views. Another problem is the studies relied rather too much on hypothetical scenarios and all involved participants resident in the US. Hopefully, though, this paper will serve as a launch pad for future research that will overcome these shortcomings, and discover more about the roots of intellectual humility and how to nurture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Promoting intellectual humility may offer one path to making disagreements more constructive,” the researchers concluded, “and our research suggests that teaching people a malleable view of intelligence may be one promising way to foster intellectual humility and its associated benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal journey to biostatistics has been quite unorthodox and convoluted; funnily, many colleagues around the world share my non-linear experience. After I received my degree in pharmacology, I spent some years in different post graduate courses, while working for a small pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story suddenly changed when I fell in love with clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK). After a training course at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, I got a Ph.D. dedicated to PK trials in oncology and then a post-doctoral position at University of Southern California, PK Lab in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very quickly realised that it would be impossible to manage complex PK studies without a good training in statistics; PK was more and more becoming a critical add-on to many oncology studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I qualified as a clinical epidemiologist/biostatistician, I found that the leap from PK models to biostatistics for oncology clinical trials was almost immediate. I could directly take part in the development of new chemotherapeutics regimens, even without the dependence on the facilities of a classical drug monitoring lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to share my ideas, interact with the study’s physicians and to support their inferences with my biostatistics models (or sometimes denying them too!) has been very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, I have been closely collaborating with oncologists, planning, performing and reporting more than a hundred human trials: hospital life has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life, not to mention its didactics value. The opportunity to share my ideas, interact with the study’s physicians and to support their inferences with my biostatistics models (or sometimes denying them too!) has been very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, I have been focusing on my editorial responsibilities, particularly with the &lt;em&gt;BMC-s&lt;/em&gt;eries journals. I have been given the opportunity to serve as Associate Editor in three different &lt;em&gt;BMC-&lt;/em&gt;series journals, &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes.&lt;/em&gt; I also serve as an Editorial Advisor for the &lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series. My collaboration with the &lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series has been highly rewarding, as I have been driven by two main motivations; my curiosity to continuously learn new and emerging topics from our international authorship and the opportunity to stay updated on established ones: both of them have been satisfied. Naturally, this has translated into a notable improvement in my research career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to be a very humble and open minded assessor, but the chances to be critical have not been lacking: new manuscripts in the field of cancer research show a widespread level of quality with regards to biostatistics. Why does this happen? There could be several different reasons. So here is some advice for potential authors on getting biostatistics right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for the support of statistical advisers not only before but even during the peer-review process, since it’s not always solicited by default from the single editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the minimum acceptable criteria for basic statistical reporting in biomedical journals, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sampl/&quot;&gt;SAMPL&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the minimum acceptable criteria for the standardization of clinical protocol items, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/spirit-2013-statement-defining-standard-protocol-items-for-clinical-trials/&quot;&gt;SPIRIT&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses might not meet the classical standards; in that case, you should properly consider the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/&quot;&gt;PRISMA&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A formal sample size estimation is not always present in the manuscripts. Don’t forget that this information is critical for your reviewers and readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is a myriad of considerations and arguments that deserve to be covered. I look forward to working with the esteemed editorial and statistical advisory boards of &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; and I warmly encourage the respectable reader to share their ideas or insights on the intersection of biostatistics with the field of cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common for psychologists to use the terms “self-control” and “cognitive control” interchangeably. Consider the introduction to a review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661313002945&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt; on whether our &lt;em&gt;self-control&lt;/em&gt; is limited or not (I’ve added the emphases): “Whereas &lt;em&gt;cognitive control&lt;/em&gt; relies on at least three separate (yet related) executive functions – task switching, working-memory, and inhibition – at its heart, &lt;em&gt;self-control&lt;/em&gt; is most clearly related to inhibitory &lt;em&gt;cognitive control&lt;/em&gt; …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scholars do make a distinction, they mostly use self-control to refer to the ability to delay immediate gratification in the service of a longer-term goal, whereas they use the term cognitive control to refer to the related ability to ignore distracting information or stimuli. Defined this way, do self-control and cognitive control essentially involve the same mental processes? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691816303870#bb0115&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by Stefan Scherbaum at Technische Universität Dresden and his colleagues in &lt;em&gt;Acta Psychologica&lt;/em&gt;, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33047&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight student participants completed alternating trials of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_effect&quot;&gt;Simon Test&lt;/a&gt; and “inter-temporal” decision making (i.e. deciding between immediate or more distant rewards). This was a mash up of a well-established cognitive control test and an established self-control test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Simon task, which taps cognitive control, required the participants to indicate as fast as possible the direction of an on-screen arrow, while ignoring the arrow’s screen location. On incongruent trials where the arrow’s direction and screen location are in opposition (e.g. a left-ward pointing arrow on the right side of the screen), it takes cognitive control to perform well at the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the inter-temporal decisions, the students had to choose between smaller cash rewards now or larger cash rewards later (they were asked to pretend these were real decisions). It takes self-control to resist smaller immediate rewards for longer-term larger gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical phenomenon that occurs during the Simon Task is that while people are generally slower on incongruent trials, completing one incongruent trial leads to improved performance on a subsequent incongruent trial, as if one’s powers of cognitive control have been activated or engaged. Scherbaum and his colleagues’ ingenious idea was to see if this effect would spill over into the decision making trials. Would participants, after having their cognitive control activated by an incongruent Simon Task trial, show more self-control when making a financial decision immediately afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cognitive control and self-control essentially involve the same cognitive processes, then the researchers should have found this spill-over effect between the two types of trial, but in fact there was no evidence for this in the results, not a hint of it. In a further analysis the researchers also couldn’t see any evidence of self-control processes, as measured by participants’ making more patient financial decisions, having any effect on their cognitive control, as measured by their subsequent Simon Task performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this study isn’t conclusive. It’s possible that different measures of cognitive control and self-control might in future uncover some overlap. However, what the new findings do suggest is that, at least to a degree, the two constructs depend on different mental processes that operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded: “While both cognitive control and self-control may be observed when we control and steer our behavior toward the pursuit of long-term goals, they may depend on different underlying processes such as the avoidance of distraction – in the case of cognitive control – or resisting short-term temptations – in the case of self-control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most contentious areas in psychology at present is the question of whether our willpower or self-control is a limited resource or not, as proposed by the theory of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=ego-depletion&quot;&gt;ego-depletion&lt;/a&gt;“. This new paper may lead us to wonder whether confusion around the related concepts of self-control and cognitive control has contributed to disagreements and inconsistencies in the research into ego-depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A greater understanding of the different mental processes that contribute to self-control and cognitive control might also contribute to better designed interventions for improving people’s focus, goal-planning and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691816303870#bb0130&quot;&gt;No evidence for common processes of cognitive control and self-control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Conferences on psychedelics are popping up everywhere, like mushrooms!” said Jakobien van der Weijden, of the Psychedelic Society of the Netherlands, when I met her in Amsterdam last week. Indeed, research into the use of psychedelic (mind-altering) drugs as tools in the treatment of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and end-of-life angst, is on the increase. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, may help to alleviate symptoms of depression by altering brain activity in key areas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-1-2018-14-13-41&quot;&gt;involved in emotional processing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/i&gt;, led by Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins University, has found that for mentally and physically healthy volunteers, two doses of psilocybin in conjunction with a programme of meditation and other “spiritual” practices was enough to bring about lasting, positive changes to traits including altruism, gratitude, forgiveness and feeling close to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 75 healthy adults, with an average age of 42, from the general population, and allocated them at random to one of three groups. The first group enrolled in “standard-level” support for spiritual practice, which consisted of a meditation book plus five hours meditation and spiritual training with an experienced “guide”. These participants then took two very low doses of psilocybin (just 1mg per 70kg – intended to act as a placebo), spaced one month apart, with each dose followed by a discussion of the experience with their spiritual guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of participants had the same level of spiritual practice support, but they were given higher doses of psilocybin – 20 mg/70kg for the first dose, and 30mg/70kg for the second (both fit into the range of dosages likely from recreational use of magic mushrooms.). Earlier studies have shown that psilocybin has various effects on the brain. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7&quot;&gt;reduces blood flow in the amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in emotional responses, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third group took the higher doses of psilocybin but also had far more extensive support and face-to-face time with their guides, and this continued for four months after their second dose of psilocybin. This included taking part in twice-monthly, 90-minute group dialogue sessions, in which they were encouraged to focus on discussing their successes and challenges in sustaining the regular spiritual practices of meditation, awareness and journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the participants nor the guides knew which psilocybin doses they had received. Six months after the start of the study, both of the high-dose groups showed large, statistically significant positive changes on measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning or purpose, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, and religious faith and coping, whereas the placebo group did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-dose, high-support group scored highest on all the scales. In some cases, such as life meaning and a rating of life “strivings” as being sacred or spiritual, they scored much higher. Unlike the high dose/standard support group, they also showed a big increase in trait forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, “Strikingly, more than half of participants in the high spiritual support condition rated their experience in one or both psilocybin sessions as the single most spiritually significant experience of their life, with 96 per cent rating it as among the top five most spiritually significant experiences.” In contrast, the percentages for the high-dose, standard support group were 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the differences in their perception of the sessions, and their rates of engagement with meditation and other spiritual practices, that explained why the high-support, high-dose group showed larger trait changes and more intense spiritual experiences than the modest-support high-dose group, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the people recruited for the study all responded to an advert for volunteers who were interested in “developing their spiritual lives by participating in a study of the combined effects of meditation and psilocybin”. It’s not clear, then, whether this kind of programme could help people who aren’t particularly interested in developing their spiritual lives. Since there was no low-dose, high-support group, it’s also hard to be sure how important psilocybin was to the observed effects – perhaps the intensive “spiritual practices” and support were the more critical ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work does suggest that further investigation of the effects of psilocybin may in theory lead to new interventions, not only to help people with a mental health disorder, but to create positive changes in attitudes and behaviour in healthy people. But there would have to be a change in the law. At the moment, in the UK, as in many other countries, psilocybin can only be consumed legally as part of an approved academic research programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other researchers involved in studies of psychedelic drugs have stressed that this work is still experimental, and have warned against self-medication. Magic mushrooms and closely-related psilocybin-containing truffles (which are legal in the Netherlands), contain varying levels of the drug, so it’s impossible to be sure of the dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;Psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience in combination with meditation and other spiritual practices produces enduring positive changes in psychological functioning and in trait measures of prosocial attitudes and behaviors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of the menopause tends be negative. Take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05tx859&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; introduction to “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05tpw79&quot;&gt;menopause week&lt;/a&gt;” held this week on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Sheffield. The well-meaning presenters talk of “distress”, the impact, the “troubling” changes, and “how to get through it”. Of course the aim is to support and educate, and it’s important to acknowledge the seriousness of some women’s problems. However, there’s arguably a risk that an overly negative tone perpetuates beliefs and stereotypes that may foster unjustified dread about the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0167482X.2017.1368486&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of PsychoSomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology&lt;/em&gt;, involving nearly 400 women aged between 40 and 60, overall women have a positive view of the menopause. What’s more, women who’ve gone through the menopause have a more positive take on it than those who’ve yet to start or who are in the middle of it. “In other words,” write Lydia Brown at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues, “for most women the menopausal transition may turn out to be not as bad as they think”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33056&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked their participants to complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247510899_Cognitive_appraisal_of_the_menopause_The_menopause_representations_questionnaire_MRQ&quot;&gt;Menopausal Representations Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; that includes questions about symptoms they attribute to the menopause, their thoughts and beliefs about the consequences of the menopause, the menopause timeline, and their perceptions of control. The researchers also devised a new scale addressing the participants’ emotions in relation to the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, participants said whether they felt (or expected to feel) anxious or less confident; whether they thought the menopause would last a long time; whether they were anxious about it; whether they were, or would be, pleased to be free of the risk of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women’s responses were positive overall. On average they disagreed that the menopause made them feel upset, angry or afraid, although they agreed it made them feel somewhat anxious and slightly more depressed. The women agreed most strongly with statements about what may be considered advantages to going through the menopause, such as the end of periods and the end of using birth control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the sample, 54 of the women were premenopausal, 48 were in the early or later stages of the menopause, and 286 had finished going through the menopause. The postmenopausal women were more positive about the menopause than the women currently going through it, although this difference was modest. In terms of their emotions, the postmenopausal women were more positive about the menopause than the premenopausal women and those currently in the menopause, and the magnitude of this difference was “clinically significant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculated that perhaps the more negative views and emotions of the premenopausal and early menopausal women is related to “affective forecasting theory”, which describes how we tend to overestimate the impact of future events on our emotions, and underestimate our ability to adapt and cope. Alternatively, perhaps the findings are explained by a more general trend for people to become more optimistic as they get older. Alternatively, or as well, maybe the postmenopausal women had developed more effective coping strategies over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the explanation, and while acknowledging that their study was limited by its cross-sectional design (it would be better to study the same women before, during and after the menopause), the researchers said their findings suggest that the more negative views held by premenopausal women may reflect a “degree of stereotype internalisation”. It may be “that the ‘dread’ of the upcoming menopause is culturally influenced”, they said, adding: “Our data show that cognitive and emotional representations of the menopause are most positive in the post menopause, when women have had the lived experience of the menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0167482X.2017.1368486&quot;&gt;It’s not as bad as you think: menopausal representations are more positive in postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research on gender identity disorder (also known as gender dysphoria, in which a person does not identify with their biological sex) questions how best to handle the condition when it arises in children and adolescents. Should biological treatments be used as early as possible to help a young client transition, or is caution required, in case of complicating psychological issues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie Bechard of the University of Toronto and her colleagues examined the prevalence of “psychosocial and psychological vulnerabilities” in 50 child and teen cases of gender dysphoria, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2016.1232325&quot;&gt;writing in a recent issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they argue their findings show that physicians should be considering these factors more seriously when deciding on a treatment plan. Salting the situation, one of the paper’s co-authors is Kenneth Zucker, an expert on gender dysphoria who was last year considered too controversial for Canadian state television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently as 2013, Zucker headed the American Psychiatric Association’s group deciding &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:http%252525253A//displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm5.pdf&quot;&gt;the diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; for gender dysphoria, but he fell from grace in 2015 when he was fired from his clinic at the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health for failing to follow the now prominent “gender-affirmative” approach that places a clinical emphasis on smoothing the process of gender transition for children and adolescents who say they no longer identify with their biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zucker’s approach, in contrast, was more hesitant and he questioned the ease with which young people can draw conclusions about their gender identity during a universally tumultuous stage of life. He also placed more emphasis on the costs that transition may bear upon an individual. To say that he considered transition a last resort would be as much of a caricature as saying the gender affirmative approach considers it a first resort, but they clearly represent different points on this spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Zucker’s critics he was a transphobe, his approach analogous to gay conversion therapy (the now widely condemned use of psychological therapy to attempt to alter a client’s sexual orientation) – for example, he reportedly advised some parents to discourage their younger children from behaving in ways that contradicted their assigned gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, hostility toward Zucker’s views was substantive enough to lead the Canadian broadcaster CBC to pull a BBC documentary that reported his perspective. For his part,  Zucker continues to maintain that his priority has always been the wellbeing of his clinical charges. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2016.1232325&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; that he co-authored with Bechard and others puts into the scientific record one of the concerns of his clinic, that gender dysphoric youth are a psychologically vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper examines the case files of 17 people assigned a male gender and 33 people assigned a female gender, at birth, based on their biological sex. Following their experience of gender dysphoria, the clients had been referred to a specialist gender identity service for young people, at which time they were aged 13 to 20. Sixty-four per cent of the clients were homosexual with respect to the gender they were assigned at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked for evidence of 15 factors that can signify or contribute to psychological issues, from self-harm to a previous outpatient therapy visit, and found that over half their sample had six or more of these factors. The majority had two or more prior diagnoses of a psychological disorder, the most common being a mood disorder such as depression. More than half had reported thinking about suicide, a third had dropped out of high school, a quarter had self harmed. A history of sexual abuse was rarer, observed in ”only” 10 per cent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these measures are likely to be underestimates because they depended on the clients’ own descriptions during their initial interview at the gender identity clinic. Without a control group, it’s hard to say whether these rates of psychological distress are higher than for other client groups. Certainly though, the findings are consistent with the sense that these individuals were already in a state of psychological vulnerability when they were referred for gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bechard’s team present in-depth examples of two clients, both assigned as female at birth, that bring these psychological complexities to life, demonstrating the kinds of situations these cases often involve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first individual was very intelligent but struggling socially, especially around girls. They were fixated on emphasising their femininity in selfies, leading the parents to suspect body dysmorphic disorder (a troubling belief that there is something wrong with one’s body). This individual’s boyfriend then came out as gay. Sometime following this, the client disclosed that they identified as a boy. This change in identity happened “overnight” with no developmental history of cross-gender identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second client’s history is more convoluted: at around age 12-13 this individual had disclosed that they were transgender (now identifying as male), and had felt this way for a while. This individual also had a history of anxiety, social problems interacting with girls, and extreme anxiety about sexuality. From the point of disclosing their gender dysphoria, they also reported that they were gay (oriented towards men) but had no interest in romantic/sexual relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both these cases, after an initial assessment the individual was given testosterone treatment by a physician against the wishes of the parents – in the first case, the physician actually refused to meet the parents, and in the second, the physician recorded that the issues raised by the parents regarding anxiety, sexual and social problems weren’t relevant for the course of action. Sadly, in the case of the second individual, a few months after the start of the hormone treatment, they made a suicide attempt that required hospitalisation; the reasons for this were not reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the indicators of psychological vulnerability identified in these case histories the consequence, cause or simply coincident to gender identity disorder? If they are all solely a fall-out from the gender dysphoria, then the decisive approach of the physicians described above has a certain sense to it. But if some of the psychological complications pre-dated the gender dysphoria, or were separate from it, then at the very least this would suggest that the consulted physicians should have considered a broader treatment plan, and considered the psychological complications when judging their clients’ “readiness” to commence biomedical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that disclosure of gender dysphoria may in some cases be driven by earlier psychological vulnerabilities and social problems seems likely to be greater than zero. This is a controversial idea among many online trans activists, but actually it isn’t among health practitioners, even those who espouse the gender affirmation philosophy, who recognise that some young gender identity referrals may be transiently mixed-up individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of pre-existing or concurrent psychological vulnerabilities also speaks to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html&quot;&gt;a substantial proportion, perhaps even the majority&lt;/a&gt;, of children who experience some form of gender identity challenge, later come to endorse the gender they were raised as (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexologytoday.org/2017/12/faulty-statistics-on-how-many-trans.html&quot;&gt;further commentary and discussion&lt;/a&gt;); the new findings may also be relevant to the experience of detransitioning individuals, who reach similar conclusions, but often after a much greater investment in the process of transition – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/25/bath-spa-university-transgender-gender-reassignment-reversal-research&quot;&gt;a phenomenon that is struggling to get scientific attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when a child with gender dysphoria is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html&quot;&gt;insistent, persistent, and consistent&lt;/a&gt;” over an extended period, then (under the gender affirmative approach) this is typically treated as a good indicator that it is appropriate to begin facilitating the transition process. The trouble is, psychological vulnerabilities can also be persistent, and if a young person feels like they’ve found the solution, it’s understandable that they might not want to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can sometimes feel as complicated as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot&quot;&gt;Gordian knot&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary challenge that was seemingly impossible to disentangle. It’s understandable to weigh up a radical solution, like Alexander the Great cleaving the knot with a single sword-stroke: to abandon your external environment for a new home, to step outside of the confines of an identity that may be the source of the myriad issues plaguing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research from Bechard, Zucker and company provides preliminary evidence about the psychological vulnerabilities of children and teens with gender dysphoria, extending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287578799_Merkmale_von_Kindern_und_Jugendlichen_mit_Geschlechtsdysphorie_in_der_Hamburger_Spezialsprechstunde&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431051&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; that’s shown high rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation in this group, but more research is required to give us the full clinical picture. As such, this new paper represents just the latest sally in a difficult, complicated conversation that’s far from over: a conversation about how we can most compassionately treat those who feel out of step with where they find themselves in the social world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/featureimage-140x110.gif&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-017-0160-2&quot;&gt;In vivo imaging of epithelial wound healing in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates early evolution of purse string and cell crawling closure mechanisms.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of wound healing have always been a highly discussed topic across many fields of science. In their paper, Kamran et al. discuss cell crawling and purse string mechanisms (a supracellular contractile ring that contracts to draw the wound margins inward) in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;, a cousin to the jellyfish. Although these mechanisms are well documented, Kamran et al.’s study presents a fascinating insight into wound healing in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electron microcopy, staining techniques and various imaging techniques, Kamran et were able to document the wound healing mechanisms in live subjects. As well as developing a wound healing assay in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;, Kamran et al. were also able to establish which wound healing mechanisms occur in this species, discovering that wound healing occurs rapidly and independently of cell proliferation. In addition, they also establish that the implementation of either Lamellipodia-dependent cell crawling or the classical purse string mechanism depends on the integrity of the basement membrane. This fascinating article has shown potential for a &lt;em&gt;Clytia&lt;/em&gt; model for wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-017-0158-9&quot;&gt;The asymmetric cell division machinery in the spiral-cleaving egg and embryo of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of asymmetric cell division goes without question. The division of cells within a zygote is imperative to the organization of cellular fates, which, in summary, is essential for the development of organs.   Spiral cleavage (the division of cells in a spiral manner), however, only occurs in species such as mollusks and annelids. In their fascinating paper, Nakama et al. sought to analyze the machinery that is involved in spiral-cleaving egg and embryo of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their study, Nakama et al. were able to identify and classify genes that are important to asymmetric cell division in the eggs and early embryos of &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; by analyzing their stage-specific transcriptome data. They were able to establish that most of the components in the spiral cleavage of marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; are maternal, which suggests that the sprialian egg in this species requires most of the components for asymmetric cell division to ensure rapid cell division. Furthermore, Nakama et al. have effectively carried out a systems-level analysis which has allowed them to identify key regulatory components that are expressed in the &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; zygote, providing an in-depth insight into the early development of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9773&quot; style=&quot;width: 482px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9773&quot; height=&quot;557&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/image-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;472&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure taken from the article documenting maternal ACD transcript levels in oocytes and zygotes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite comparative gene expression being important in developmental and evolutionary research, it seems that spatial expression surveys are restricted to models such as zebrafish and other laboratory models. In this fascinating paper, Bloomquist et al. have produced a compendium of developmental gene expression in a Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, a model that is used to conduct research into the developmental and genetic basis of trait diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting study, Bloomquist et al. have managed to acquire expression data for many important expression pathways in the Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, including the TGF-β/BMP pathway, FGF pathway and the notch pathway, pathways which are well documented in many laboratory models, including zebrafish, xenopus and the more distantly related chicken. In addition, Bloomquist et al. have also observed stem cell/mitogenic factors, as well as calcium and endocrine signals, at 4 and 6 days post-fertilization, which are rarely seen in whole mount studies such as these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Bloomquist et al. have managed to start crafting a compendium which has opened the door for possible future studies into the function of the genes expressed at the early development of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which could be applied to many species of Eastern African cichlid fishes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/DPC_logo_v_hires-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-9780&quot; height=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/DPC_logo_h_hires-1.png&quot; width=&quot;6720&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of minority underrepresentation in science is not new and yet it remains deeply challenging. Just 8 percent of science and engineering doctorate holders in the United States are underrepresented minorities, compared to 30 percent in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives us hope that we can yet achieve inclusive science is the National Institutes of Health-funded Diversity Program Consortium (DPC) which we learn about in depth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-11-supplement-12&quot;&gt;The Diversity Program Consortium: Innovating Educational Practice and Evaluation Along the Biomedical Research Pathways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; supplement dives into the critical work of the DPC and its components: the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) Initiative, the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), and the Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC). These are based on a comprehensive approach to changing institutional culture and practice, combined with rigorous evaluation that supports the success of a stronger, diverse biomedical research workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomedical research advances healthcare for all Americans. It is strengthened when we include researchers who bring a broad range of perspectives to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is a priority for our nation. When we wrote the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, &lt;em&gt;Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America’s Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads, &lt;/em&gt;our focus on the &lt;u&gt;crossroads&lt;/u&gt; was intentional because we have choices to make. Do we want a robust scientific enterprise fueling innovation that drives our future? Do we want the best STEM workforce for that enterprise?  Will we draw on our nation’s talent – from all backgrounds – for the strongest workforce possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomedical research advances healthcare for all Americans. It is strengthened when we include researchers who bring a broad range of perspectives to the work. Our focus on health disparities ensures advances in healthcare reach every community and address their needs. This work is strengthened when researchers from diverse communities engage in formulating the questions and conducting the research. We achieve this through inclusive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long way to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly we have never been close to realizing a fully inclusive research workforce. &lt;em&gt;In Rising Above the Gathering Storm&lt;/em&gt;, the National Academies recommended we increase the percentage of our 24-year-olds with a first university degree in STEM from 6 to 10 percent. To be inclusive as we achieve this, we would need to triple, quadruple, or quintuple the numbers of underrepresented minorities in STEM.  Just 3.3 percent of Native Americans/Alaska Natives, 2.7 percent of African Americans, and 2.2 percent of Hispanics hold these degrees. This stems from persistent underrepresentation of minorities in science that deepens as we ascend the ladder from primary grades, through college, to research careers capped with R01 research funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-11-supplement-12&quot;&gt;This supplement of &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes how BUILD actively supports minority students through innovative training strategies that address academic and psychosocial factors, support persistence, and overcome the negative effects of implicit bias, hostile climates, or isolation. The work is systemic, focusing on curriculum development, undergraduate research, mentoring, and institutional partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is one of 10 BUILD grantees. We are using our grant to extend what we learned from our Meyerhoff Scholars Programs for high-achieving minorities to a broader population of undergraduates in the sciences. Nine other BUILD campuses are implementing programs organic to their populations, drawing on exemplary practice and innovating in their curricula, pedagogy, faculty development, and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, at UMBC, quality is defined by the rigor of the work plus the support that allows students to achieve high standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many well-prepared students, including minorities, who arrive on our campuses intending to major in STEM or the biomedical sciences. Unfortunately, many departments still define quality in terms of the number of students they can weed out, which removes talent that our nation needs. For us, at UMBC, quality is defined by the rigor of the work plus the support that allows students to achieve high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people come to our campus they are often surprised to find minorities among the highest achieving students in science. That is our vision at UMBC. For institutions to be successful in fostering inclusive excellence, this must be the vision on all campuses, as well. Too often these initiatives are left to junior faculty without the authority to re-think policies and practices. To the extent that respected researchers become involved and academic administrators take ownership of this initiative, we will see substantive progress in increasing the numbers of successful students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supplement also describes the NRMN and the CEC. The NRMN has five regional hubs that recruit skilled mentors and partner them with underrepresented minority mentees who do not have a mentor to guide them. The CEC at UCLA coordinates across grantees and conducts assessments to identify long-term outcomes and scalable, best practice. We believe that evaluation is critical to the DPC’s work as it supports both program development and dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of change agents who recruit supporters and allies and working tirelessly for success cannot be overstated. The next step is to disseminate what is working to other institutions in a way that inspires academic leaders to become invested and allows campus change agents to readily adapt best practice to their institutional settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine a crueller fate than when a child receives a diagnosis of an illness as difficult as cancer. A young human being, still not fully formed, is suddenly and irrevocably thrown into a situation that many adults are unable to cope with. Each year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21219/abstract;jsessionid=A25F53B917E2715D7E8CDFE1D5BDF3AD.f04t02&quot;&gt;around 160,000 children and youngsters worldwide are diagnosed with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and this trend is growing in industrialised societies. Faced with such facts, it is particularly important to understand how children cope. What traces of the experience remain in their psyche if they manage to survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial answers to these questions come from a trio of Australian researchers in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4577/abstract&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of existing research into the psychological effects of cancer on children, published recently in &lt;i&gt;Psycho-Oncology&lt;/i&gt;. Their findings give us reason for some optimism. It turns out children and adolescents affected by cancer are no more likely to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms than their healthy peers. In fact, several studies have found that children affected by cancer go on to experience greater than usual adjustment and quality of life and lower anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In psychology, we refer to this as the post-traumatic growth (PTG) effect, which can arise from the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances or trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33021&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the analysed body of research – 18 studies in all – indicated that participants who were older when surveyed, or older when diagnosed with cancer, were more likely to experience PTG. Most likely, this is a product of the development of abstract reasoning that occurs sometime after the 11th or 12th year of life, when adolescents begin to formulate their own value systems, take an interest in philosophical ideas, and think about the meaning of life – cognitive processes that are involved in the development of PTG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis also revealed a small but statistically significant correlation between post-traumatic stress and PTG. By definition, the struggle with trauma is necessary for the development of PTG, because it is during such struggles with disease that a teenager may experience both obsessive thoughts about death, but also may begin to appreciate life more. The vision of losing the normalcy that healthy people take for granted can turn into affirmation of that very normalcy. It is precisely these difficult experiences in youth that contribute to the formation of individuals who psychologists refer to as “prematurely mature”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least surprising result was the positive link between PTG and having greater social support, as well as between PTG and being more optimistic. Unfortunately, these correlations don’t tell us whether social support and optimism lead to PTG, or if the reverse is true. Further studies may identify the causal relations between these factors. In turn this may help inform the development of support programmes targeting children with cancer and other difficult illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new meta-analysis also looked for potential correlations between PTG and depression, anxiety, pessimism, and quality of life, but all were statistically nonsignificant. Jasmin Turner and her colleagues suspect that this could be caused by small sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, psychology has treated negative human experiences as unequivocally harmful to people, assuming that they lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, and poorer psychological and physical functioning. Regardless of their actual psychological state, people who have survived negative experiences have sometimes been treated like patients in need of help, and at times &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/16/is-it-time-to-resurrect-post-trauma-psychological-debriefing-for-emergency-responders-and-aid-workers/&quot;&gt;this help has even proved harmful to them&lt;/a&gt;. The discovery that following some traumatic situations, tears can turn into pearls is one of the more significant and promising discoveries of psychology. Understanding when and why this happens is a means for science to make a clear contribution to improving people’s well-being. And while the new results are not very strong, nevertheless they may help guide future research, potentially helping social support and clinical interventions for cancer patients. Also important is consideration of the factors leading to PTG and how to share this information appropriately and sensitively with people suffering illnesses. However, before we can label any such programmes as “evidence based”, further studies are necessary, particularly longitudinal research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is not worth waiting passively for the results of such studies. With the knowledge that the experience of trauma can lead to PTG, we can begin providing intelligent support to people whose luck is down – encouraging reflection on the experience of trauma, rather than mechanical consolation with exhortations to think positively. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/20/new-meta-analysis-undermines-the-myth-that-negative-emotions-can-cause-cancer/&quot;&gt;Intelligent support should be an unobtrusive presence, without encouraging the rejection of negative emotions, and without attempts at eliciting positive ones&lt;/a&gt;. In all certainty, this kind of approach will be different from the offerings we have received for many years from some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/14/positive-psychology-exercises-can-be-harmful-for-some/&quot;&gt;unreflexive positive psychologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/01/15/extending-christmas-to-fight-the-flu/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/2809961438_56d48f9969_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;School closure, a necessary break for both teachers and students, is also associated with mitigating influenza outbreaks. Purposely closing schools during outbreaks of influenza is not officially recommended by the World Health Organisation; however, this non-pharmaceutical intervention is well regarded as an approach in reducing the epidemic impact. A well-known example of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-207&quot;&gt;closure of schools during the swine flu epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Luca &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;’s study considers the effect of regulated school holidays in interrupting influenza propagation by offering variety in social mixing and travel – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21176155&quot;&gt;two key determinants&lt;/a&gt; of influenza epidemic potency. The authors aimed to integrate social mixing and travel of children and adults during school/holiday periods into a spatial metapopulation that also utilised data based on demographics and infection dynamics. Focusing on the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium, the mathematical model was calibrated to the singular district of Brussels which showed accurate scalability to a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors observed how the growth of the number of new infections significantly slowed during the Christmas holidays whereas the fall and Easter holidays had little effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model was further parameterized with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health. Once the Belgian school calendar was applied, the authors tested a number of experimental scenarios. Different scheduled holidays were first removed and replaced with regular school/working weeks from the model to observe the effect on an epidemic’s timing and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors observed how the growth of the number of new infections significantly slowed during the Christmas holidays whereas the fall and Easter holidays had little effect. The benefit of weekends in periodically slowing down the epidemic curve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931200375X&quot;&gt;was also observed&lt;/a&gt;. Altering the contact and behaviour among groups of people over weekends and holidays is thought to alter epidemic dynamics, causing a smaller epidemic with less incidences. Altered mixing behaviour during weekends and holidays was found more influential on the spread of an epidemic than travel was in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthering the observation that &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/215/5/732/2751325&quot;&gt;Christmas holidays can play a large role on epidemic impact&lt;/a&gt;, extension methods were tested. Adding a week of holiday before Christmas had no impact on the epidemics timing or severity, however, whilst extending the Christmas holidays could not delay the epidemic, it could reduce the severity as the number of ILIs decreased. Additional breaks beyond Christmas may also prove to have a mitigating impact, but the whole calendar must be considered as holidays throughout the year all affect the epidemic’s evolution differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis on a single season represents how the impact of regular school closures slow and mitigate influenza epidemics. However, the epidemic impact of school closure is heavily dependent on the closure timing and influenza season. The authors also noted that contacts and their changes throughout the calendar are likely to be country-specific. An improved understanding on the behavioural changes caused by an epidemic are required to further parameterize models for epidemic management which may be achieved by incorporating additional seasons and more specific age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact that school closures can have on influenza may help manage future epidemics and attenuate pressure placed on public health services. These findings may be of relevant use to authorities considering reducing summer holidays to redistribute spare holidays throughout the year to manage the influenza season. The results from this study have helped shine light on previous studies performed throughout the world; therefore, it would be worthwhile to apply similar models in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve had all day to worry, but your brain decides that the moment you rest your weary head upon your pillow is the precise instant it wants to start fretting. The result of course is that you feel wide awake and cannot sleep. Two possible solutions: (1) spend five minutes before lights out writing about everything you have done. This might give you a soothing sense of achievement. Or (2) spend five minutes writing a comprehensive to-do list. This could serve to off-load your worries, or perhaps it will only make them more salient? To find out which is the better strategy, a team led by Michael Scullin at Baylor University, invited 57 volunteers to their sleep lab and had half of them try technique 1 and half try technique 2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001&quot;&gt;Their findings&lt;/a&gt; are published in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33034&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants, aged 18 to 30, attended the sleep lab at about 9pm on a weekday night. They filled out questionnaires about their usual sleep habits and underwent basic medical tests. Once in their sound-proofed room and wired up to equipment that uses brain waves to measure sleep objectively, they were told that lights out would be 10.30pm. Before they tried to sleep, half of the participants spent five minutes “writing about everything you have to remember to do tomorrow and over the next few days”. The others spent the same time writing about any activities they’d completed that day and over the previous few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding is that the participants in the to-do list condition fell asleep more quickly. They took about 15 minutes to fall asleep, on average, compared with 25 minutes for those in the “jobs already done” condition. Moreover, among those in the to-do list group, the more thorough and specific their list, the more quickly they fell asleep, which would seem to support a kind of off-loading explanation. Another interpretation is that busier people, who had more to write about, tended to fall asleep more quickly. But this is undermined by the fact that among the jobs-done group, those who wrote in more detail tended to take longer to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than journal about the day’s completed tasks or process tomorrow’s to-do list in one’s mind, the current experiment suggests that individuals spend five minutes near bedtime thoroughly writing a to-do list,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the experiment didn’t have a baseline no-intervention control group, so it’s possible that the shorter time-to-sleep of the to-do list writing intervention was actually a reflection of journaling about completed jobs making it harder to fall asleep. Also, note the current sample didn’t have any sleep problems. Scullin and his team say the next step is to conduct a longer-running randomised control trial of the to-do list intervention outside of the sleep lab, with people who do and don’t have sleep-onset insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not by assessing individual works but by consideration and evaluation of consistent contributions to a discipline over time. Contributions may be independently substantial, but in science, a researcher’s impact is more often made through gradual insights that accrue meaning as a discipline advances. Over the course of a career, creative thinkers and leaders in science can significantly influence a field, and humanity more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently established award provides one measure of lifetime achievement for life sciences—the Breakthrough Prize. Established in 2013, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Prize/2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; honors “transformative advances toward understanding living systems and extending human life.” The prize encourages celebration and recognition of “outstanding minds.” Those scientists who “think big, take risks and have made a significant impact on our lives” each receive $3 million for their work that provides fundamental and far-reaching understanding of biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences is designed to bring public attention, financial reward and a bit of glamor to outstanding scientists who over the course of their careers have changed the way scientists think about basic principles. Through a central component of the award, the impact of honored scientists’ work is extended to a broader general audience. Recipients are invited to present public talks – with recorded lectures made &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Lectures&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available to the public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – “allowing everyone to keep abreast of the latest developments in life sciences, guided by contemporary masters of the field,” according to the Breakthrough Prize website. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prizes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are also awarded in fundamental physics and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, five scientists received life sciences prizes; collectively these creative thinkers have published 30 papers in PLOS journals (13 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 16 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and one in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;), providing their work to the global community free of access and reuse restrictions. The 2018 Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences were awarded to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two scientists, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/2/L3825&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kazutoshi Mori&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of Kyoto University, Japan, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/2/L3824&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Walter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco, received Breakthrough Prizes for their independent work on “elucidating the unfolded protein response, a cellular quality-control system that detects disease-causing unfolded proteins and directs cells to take corrective measures.” The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a phylogenetically conserved endoplasmic reticulum-to-nucleus signaling pathway that senses unfolded proteins early on in the biosynthetic process, and then transmits that information to the cell nucleus. This information stimulates a genetic transcription program designed to re-establish cellular homeostasis by increasing the intracellular machinery and processes that help proteins fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various cellular insults, writes Mori in his team’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040374&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, “including exposure to pharmacological agents that perturb protein folding, genetic mutation of ER chaperones or chaperone substrates, viral infection, metabolic demands, and even normal differentiation and function of professional secretory cells” impact the UPR in similar and unique ways. His earlier work &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Mori_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published with PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; examined the differential influence of low-level, severe and chronic stress on UPR activation. More recently, Mori has extended his investigations to the development of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161486&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high-throughput screening assay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that incorporates a molecular biosensor to identify small molecule activators of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in malignant glioma cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since 2004, Walter has published &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Walter_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 papers with PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; covering the role of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040423&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endoplasmic reticulum expansion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the UPR in yeast; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004170&quot;&gt;teasing out&lt;/a&gt; of the relationship between cell proliferation, cell death and protein folding in human embryonic kidney cell lines; and the importance of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001735&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;targeting a key transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the cell membrane, to provide the appropriate cellular response to protein folding status in bacteria. Walter’s first two papers published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, presented as a series together with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020269&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, described amplitude adjustment signals for the UPR in yeast. Prior to this work, the UPR was thought to largely be a binary, on or off, function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than other prize recipients, Joanne Chory was surprised by her inclusion as an awardee, explaining to the &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, “this prize has been more associated with biomedical things.” The award may be a nod to the relevance of Chory’s current work to climate change. Those interested in the connection between mechanisms of sunlight and clock-regulated plant development to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salk.edu/news-release/salk-institutes-joanne-chory-awarded-prestigious-breakthrough-prize-life-sciences/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; may find of interest the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecological Impacts of Climate Change Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and newly launched &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/rtcc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Responding to Climate Change Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Retraction watch: Authors retract paper on psychopathic traits in bosses</title>
	<link>http://retractionwatch.com/2018/01/12/authors-withdraw-paper-psychopathic-traits-bosses/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the meeting was to create a signed statement which acknowledges the efforts that participant organizations have made towards improving the reporting of animal studies and reiterating a commitment to drive further improvements, calling upon both academics and laboratory animal veterinarians to help make this cultural change.  You can read the signed statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-017-1235-9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we improve animal research reporting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like me, you might think that this topic is becoming a bit repetitive.  For almost a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007824&quot;&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; we have seen some improvement in animal research reporting, but it’s not enough, which is why we are still asking the same questions about how we can tackle this issue.  So, what is preventing us from seeing any real progression?  Who is responsible for enforcing greater transparency in animal research – the research institution, the funder, the editor, or the researchers themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to see any real progress in animal research reporting, we must all work together to create solutions that make animal research reporting easier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the answer to this problem lies firmly in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of our hands.  If we want to see any real progress in animal research reporting, we must all work together to create solutions that make animal research reporting easier for not just the researcher, but also for the institution, the funding body, the editor and those that participate in peer review.  We also need to provide better support and training for researchers to raise awareness of these issues more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the topic that was debated during the round table meeting, which heard opinions from institutions, funders, and editors alike.  We agreed that all organizations need to unite so that we can help researchers plan, design and present their research in a manner that can be fully evaluated, utilized and reproduced at the start of their planning – not after.  We need to create a path where one organization passes the “baton” on to the next (institute&amp;gt;funder&amp;gt;journal).  What form this might take is still open to debate, but the idea of creating a universal document which the authors use throughout their research journey proved to be popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we are looking for greater consistency amongst authors, so we need to tackle differences in research culture worldwide, also taking into consideration the language used in our requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would build on the work already achieved by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), who have created a common set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility/principles-guidelines-reporting-preclinical-research&quot;&gt;Principles and Guidelines in Reporting Preclinical Research&lt;/a&gt; for both publishers and researchers, and that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/&quot;&gt;Nature research journals&lt;/a&gt;, which have implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf&quot;&gt;journal level checklist&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on experimental and analytical design elements that ensure robust reporting standards and improve the reproducibility of published results.  Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iclas.org/&quot;&gt;International Committee on Laboratory Animal Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (ICLAS) has created Harmonised Animal Research Reporting Principles (HARRP) for those authors, institutions, and publishers throughout the world for whom setting minimum standards is a priority because current best practice standards seem such a faraway dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our efforts, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;is committed to improving the quality of veterinary and animal research reporting, using innovative approaches to peer-review and publication that will encourage more complete reporting, and thus, greater transparency, integrity, and reproducibility of the research we publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We require our authors to adhere to the BMC &lt;a href=&quot;http://resource-cms.springer.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/7117202/data/v2/Minimum+standards+of+reporting+checklist&quot;&gt;Minimum Standards of Reporting&lt;/a&gt; (published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biology&lt;/em&gt;), in addition to relevant reporting standards, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/arrive/&quot;&gt;ARRIVE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/reflect/&quot;&gt;REFLECT&lt;/a&gt;. The checklist is intended as an aid for authors to clearly, completely and transparently let reviewers and readers know what they did and found.  Authors should upload relevant reporting checklists as supplementary material during submission (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/&quot;&gt;MERIDIAN&lt;/a&gt; for further guidance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where information that is critical to the study may be lacking (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11556&quot;&gt;randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, inclusion/exclusion criteria&lt;/a&gt;, and statistical assessment), we expect authors to acknowledge non-compliance within a limitations section of their manuscript and discuss how these factors may influence the interpretation of their research findings.  We hope this level of transparency will help future researchers build on our published research more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;will also be launching a new Study Protocol article type that will enable the reader to compare the protocol to the subsequent research paper to assess possible reporting bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data sharing is also essential to the promotion of transparency and reproducibility. We, therefore, strongly encourage that all datasets are made available to readers, either by deposition of the dataset in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/repositories/12327124&quot;&gt;publicly available repository&lt;/a&gt; or presented within the main manuscript or additional supporting files wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;will also be launching a new Study Protocol article type.  Protocols will allow greater understanding of the scientific rigor of the design and results, but more importantly, will enable the reader to compare the protocol to the subsequent research paper to assess possible reporting bias. By making veterinary protocols publicly available, we hope to improve the transparency of the research process in the veterinary field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to collaborate with research institutions and their initiatives to train early career researchers on the various research reporting services available to them – including adherence to reporting standards and the recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://norecopa.no/PREPARE&quot;&gt;PREPARE&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.  Working alongside our &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt;, we hope to visit various institutions and major conferences to provide workshops.  If your institution is interested in hosting such an event, please get in touch by contacting &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bmcvetres@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;bmcvetres@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more projects in the pipeline that focus on improving animal research reporting at &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;, and we look forward to sharing these with you later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Microaggressions” are seemingly innocuous words or behaviour that supposedly communicate a bias toward minority groups, such as asking Asian Americans where they are from, implying that they are not really part of the USA. According to advocates of the usefulness of the concept, microaggressions cause real harm, even if unintended by the perpetrator. However, the theoretical and evidential support for the concept of microaggressions is far from clear, as detailed in Scott Lilienfeld’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/16/the-scientific-evidence-for-microaggressions-is-weak-and-we-should-drop-the-term-argues-review-author/&quot;&gt;thorough critique&lt;/a&gt;, which recommended the term be revised or at least re-examined. Now, Craig Harper, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University, has published a study as &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/973v8/&quot;&gt;a pre-print online at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; that, he argues, reveals a further key problem with the concept of the microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33032&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it’s usually defined, a microaggression only counts as such when a &lt;i&gt;majority&lt;/i&gt; group member commits an act that a &lt;i&gt;minority&lt;/i&gt; group member perceives as a slight. The term was coined to account for slights against Black people, and has since expanded to other groups. On his &lt;em&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/em&gt; blog, Derald Sue at Columbia University, one of the originators of the microaggression concept, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201011/microaggressions-more-just-race&quot;&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; microaggressions are “everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that … target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership”. For his new study, Craig Harper’s aim was to examine whether it’s true that the experience of “being microaggressed at” really does only flow in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper recruited around 400 US participants online and split them into three groups according to their political beliefs: conservative, liberal, or moderate. They also answered questions about their pride in belonging to their political grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants then read six fictional scenarios in which a professor made a contentious claim to his students. For example, in one, a male professor explained that the reason women are under-represented in certain professions is entirely due to their personal choice. A female student then responded in a frustrated manner, but was told by the professor to calm down and that this was not a place for “policy agendas.” This is a fairly typical example of what the literature considers a microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the scenarios were balanced so only half the microaggressions targeted people who would normally be seen as victims: women, Black people, and liberals. The other three scenarios kept the topics (such as educational attainment and political diversity), but switched the social identities of the perpetrator and victim. For example, in one case, a female professor justified lower rates of men in certain professions and then showed impatience towards a male student who complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading each scenario, the participants said whether they thought the student was right to feel insulted or had been overly sensitive. They also said whether they thought the professor was bigoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly perhaps, the students’ own political orientation shaped their response. Harper found that political liberals judged the fictional professors more harshly when they targeted racial minorities, women and those on the political left, compared to other targets. The students with more conservative leanings were less bothered by the scenario content overall, but showed the opposite pattern, being more critical when majorities, men and conservatives were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper says this is important because it shows, contrary to the the conventional definition of the microaggression concept, that microaggressions aren’t only experienced by those who fall into certain minority political categories. Instead it seems that anyone who thinks their in-group has been slighted by an out-group member may feel as if they’ve been “microaggressed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly relevant to one’s sensitivity to potential microaggressions, according to Harper,  is the concept of “collective narcissism” – how much we believe in the superiority of our in-group (typified by agreement with statements like “If people with my political views had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place”). Based on the participants’ ratings of their pride in their political in-group, there wasn’t any evidence this factor mattered for the liberal groups’ perception of microaggressions. For some of the conservative participants, however, it was those showing more collective narcissism who showed greater sensitivity to slighted right-wing targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding for collective narcissism is tentative at this stage. In fact, Harper’s paper has not yet been peer reviewed and there may be further interpretations of the results that Harper hasn’t considered. But it seems clear that once you are willing to put aside the lens of power to understand microaggressions, you can study the concept like other forms of motivated social cognition we understand quite well, such as, Harper says, the tendency “to shun or discredit those with whom we are ideologically opposed”. These new findings suggest that those who argue microaggressions are a societal concern specifically afflicting minorities may have to recognise that other interest groups – especially in spaces that lean left, not right, like most universities – will have a claim to play the same game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/973v8/&quot;&gt;Political Microaggressions Across the Ideological Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; (note this study is a preprint and has not yet been subjected to peer review)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s widely accepted children’s development reflects an interaction between their genes and the environment they are raised in. More tentative is the intriguing idea that the role of the environment is more consequential for some children than others. According to this view, a minority of children are environmentally sensitive “orchids” who suffer disproportionately in adversity, but who especially thrive in positive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, research into this idea has been stifled by the lack of a short, reliable test of children’s Environmental Sensitivity. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-42386-001&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Michael Pluess at Queen Mary University of London has now developed a 12-item scale for this purpose. Preliminary work using the test supports the importance of the Environmental Sensitivity concept and suggests children fall into three groups: orchids; dandelions, who are relatively unaffected by the environment; and tulips, who are midway between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33019&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers started by asking over 300 children aged 11 to 14 years, at a school in East London, to complete an established adult measure of Environmental Sensitivity. Based on the children’s answers, the researchers removed unnecessary items and whittled the measure down to create a “Highly Sensitive Child” (HSC) test that asks children to rate how strongly they agree with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it unpleasant to have a lot going on at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some music can make me really happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loud noises make me feel uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am annoyed when people try to get me to do too many things at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notice it when small things have changed in my environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get nervous when I have to do a lot in little time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice smells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like watching TV programs that have a lot of violence in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like loud noises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like it when things change in my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone observes me, I get nervous. This makes me perform worse than normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers put their new test through its paces, by giving it, together with other personality measures, to  258 more children, aged 11-12 years, also at a school in East London; to 104 children (aged 8-11 years) at two London primary schools, who took the new test twice, several weeks apart; and to nearly 1,500 teenagers from across England and Wales, aged 15-19 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from these tests showed that like the adult version of the test, the new test appears to tap three separate factors (Aesthetic sensitivity; Ease of Excitation; and Low Sensory Threshold) that correlate and contribute to a general trait of Environmental Sensitivity. Importantly, Environmental Sensitivity appeared to be distinct from other traits already established in psychology, such as trait Neuroticism (or emotional instability). There was also notable stability in their Environmental Sensitivity scores when children took the test twice, weeks apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final analysis, the researchers combined all their data and looked to see whether the distribution of Environmental Sensitivity scores supported the idea that a minority of children are orchids, while the majority are “dandelions” and less sensitive to the environment, positive or negative. In fact, the new data suggested that scores tend to fall into three groupings, with roughly 30 per cent of children matching the environmentally sensitive “orchid” category, 30 per cent being “dandelions” and showing a distinct lack of Environmental Sensitivity, and the remainder being “tulips”, midway between the two other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is need to test the reality of these categories and how they differ from each other, or whether it might actually be more accurate to see variation in Environmental Sensitivity as an unbroken continuum. It will also be interesting to see whether and how patterns of Environmental Sensitivity vary across cultures, and what are the factors that influence a child’s score on the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s already exciting from a practical and theoretical perspective, though, is that early research (conducted separately from the current study) using the new Highly Sensitive Child test, suggests that Environmental Sensitivity is a meaningful concept with important implications. For instance, a long-term study in the US of juvenile offenders (currently unpublished) found that risk of re-offending was more strongly related to quality of the home environment, good and bad, among those who scored high on Environmental Sensitivity. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-51819-001&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that both positive and negative parenting styles were more consequential for children rated higher by their parents on Environmental Sensitivity (using an adapted version of the new HSC test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Environmental Sensitivity is an important individual characteristic that is related to, but largely distinct from, other common temperament and personality traits,” the researchers said. “The current study suggests that it is possible to measure Environmental Sensitivity reliably in children and adolescents with the Highly Sensitive Child scale, a 12-item self-report measure with good psychometric properties.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Getting a good night’s sleep before doing the housework</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/cleaning-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Household activities are a core part of the daily lives of retirees. Previous work has found that this population devotes more time to housework activities than their working spouses and this has become more pronounced since the increase in life expectancy and subsequently the increase in time spent not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, men tend to still avoid the washing up, even post retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9750 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/garden-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In their study just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at &lt;em&gt;Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen&lt;/em&gt; found notable differences between the type of housework men and women spent time on. Across all countries included in this study, men spent less time cleaning, cooking and shopping than women (88.7 minutes a day compared to 217.9 minutes a day). However, women were found to spend less time on gardening and maintenance tasks than men (38.5 minutes a day compared to 68.8 minutes a day). This supports previous work which shows that women are more likely to engage in routine, every-day chores compared to their spouses who are more involved in occasional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also carried out a cross-country comparison among Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. They found that elderly women in Italy and Germany spent the most time on housework (around five hours a day), while women in the US spent the least amount of time doing housework (four hours a day). In contrast, elderly men in Italy spent the least amount of time on housework (2.7 hours a day) and German men spent the most time on housework (4.2 hours a day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sleep constituting the lengthiest time use activity among the elderly, the authors also set out to address to what extent the association between housework activities and health is moderated by sleep hours among men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the study used self-reported data from 15,333 men and 20,907 women aged 65 years and over from Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. Participants reported the total time they spent per day on 41 activities in 5, 10 or 15-minute intervals. They also reported the total amount of time they spent sleeping per day, as well as whether they felt they were in poor, fair, good or very good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.  Conversely, for men, long hours of housework was associated with good health status regardless of sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;
