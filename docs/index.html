              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-shrinking-birds-tropical">Climate change may be shrinking tropical birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a remote corner of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, researchers have spent decades catching and measuring birds in a large swath of forest unmarred by roads or deforestation. An exemplar of the Amazon’s dazzling diversity, the experimental plot was to act as a baseline that would reveal how habitat fragmentation, from logging or roads, can hollow out rainforests’ wild menagerie.</p>



<p>But in this pristine pocket of wilderness, a more subtle shift is happening: The birds are shrinking.</p>



<p>Over 40 years, dozens of Amazonian bird species have declined in mass. Many species have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk1743?_ga=2.158979514.1693468232.1636375617-964207880.1635952783">lost nearly 2 percent of their average body weight</a> each decade, researchers report November 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. What’s more, some species have grown longer wings. The changes coincide with a hotter, more variable climate, which could put a premium on leaner, more efficient bodies that help birds stay cool, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“Climate change isn’t something of the future. It’s happening now and has been happening and has effects we haven’t thought of,” says Ben Winger, an ornithologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the research but has documented similar shrinkage in migratory birds. Seeing the same patterns in so many bird species across widely different contexts “speaks to a more universal phenomenon,” he says.</p>





<p>Biologists have long linked body size and temperature. In colder climates, it pays to be big because having a smaller surface area relative to one’s volume reduces heat loss through the skin and keeps the body warmer. As the climate warms, “you’d expect shrinking body sizes to help organisms off-load heat better,” says Vitek Jirinec, an ecologist at the Integral Ecology Research Center in Blue Lake, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many species of North American migratory birds <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13434">are getting smaller</a>, Winger and colleagues reported in 2020 in <em>Ecology Letters</em>. Climate change is the likely culprit, Winger says, but since migrators experience a wide range of conditions while globe-trotting, other factors such as degraded habitats that birds may encounter can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>To see if birds that stay put have also been shrinking, Jirinec and colleagues analyzed data on nonmigratory birds collected from 1979 to 2019 in an intact region of the Amazon that spans 43 kilometers. The dataset includes measurements such as mass and wing length taken from 1979 to 2019 for over 11,000 individual birds of 77 species. The researchers also examined climate data for the region.</p>

<p>All species declined in mass over this period, the researchers found, including birds as different as the Rufous-capped antthrush (<em>Formicarius colma</em>), which snatches insects off the forest floor, and the Amazonian motmot (<em>Momotus momota</em>)<em>, </em>which scarfs down fruit up in trees. Species lost from about 0.1 percent to nearly 2 percent of their average body weight each decade. The motmot, for example, shrunk from 133 grams to about 127 grams over the study period.</p>



<p>These changes coincided with an overall increase in the average temperature of 1 degree Celsius in the wet season and 1.65 degrees C in the dry season. Temperature and precipitation also became more variable over the time period, and these short-term fluctuations, such as an especially hot or dry season, better explained the size trends than the steady increase in temperature.</p>



<p>“The dry season is really stressful for birds,” Jirinec says. Birds’ mass decreased the most in the year or two after especially hot and dry spells, which tracks with the idea that birds are getting smaller to deal with heat stress.</p>



<p>Other factors, like decreased food availability, could also lead to smaller sizes. But since birds with widely different diets all declined in mass, a more pervasive force like climate change is the likely cause, Jirinec says.</p>



<p>Wing length also grew for 61 species, with a maximum increase of about 1 percent per decade. Jirinec thinks that longer wings make for more efficient, and thus cooler, fliers. For instance, a fighter jet, with its heavy body and compact wings, takes enormous power to maneuver. A light and long-winged glider, by contrast, can cruise along much more efficiently.</p>



<p>“Longer wings may be helping [birds] fly more efficiently and produce less metabolic heat,” which can be beneficial in hotter conditions, he says. “But that’s just a hypothesis.” This body change was most pronounced in birds that spend their time higher up in the canopy, where conditions are hotter and drier than the forest floor.</p>



<p>Whether these changes in shape and size represent an evolutionary adaptation to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">climate change</a>, or simply a physiological response to warmer temperatures, remains unclear (<em>SN: 5/8/20</em>). Whichever is the case, Jirinec suggests that the change shows the pernicious power of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">human activity</a> (<em>SN: 10/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>“The Amazon rainforest is mysterious, remote and teeming with biodiversity,” he says. “This study suggests that even in places like this, far removed from civilization, you can see signatures of climate change.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Hallucinatory experiences are pretty common, despite widespread beliefs to the contrary. Researchers estimate that around 40% of the population regularly experience hallucinations to some degree, whether that be feeling your phone vibrate only to find no notifications, or a full-on out of body experience.</p>



<p>Though hallucinations are common, some are harder to study than others. One of the trickiest has been autoscopic hallucinations, during which people experience a doppelganger of all or part of their body in the space around them.</p>



<p>Though this hallucination has been reported to clinicians, its rarity has made it difficult to observe in an experimental setting — so researchers have instead attempted to induce the phenomenon in the lab. Now, Marte Roel Lesur and team at the University of Zurich have developed a way to experimentally induce it in people who have no history of hallucinations using only auditory cues.</p>



<span id="more-44546"></span>



<p>Previous research has placed significant emphasis on the role of vision in producing these hallucinations, and some visual methods have even been developed to induce these kinds of experiences experimentally. For example, in 2007 researchers at University College London were able to shift participants’ perceptions of where their bodies were in space using a virtual reality video feed of their backs, positioned a few metres behind where they were sitting. But people sometimes also report auditory hallucinations during this phenomenon, leading the team in Zurich to develop a new method that relies on audio cues alone.</p>



<p>In this study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810021001495">published in <em>Consciousness</em></a><em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810021001495"> and Cognition</a></em>,  participants (N=25) produced a series of tightly controlled binaural recordings of themselves walking into a room and reading excerpts from The Little Prince. One set of microphones were placed in the ears of a dummy sitting across the room from the participants, in order to create recordings with true-to-life location cues. Another set of microphones recorded from the ears of the participants themselves.</p>



<p>Participants then sat with their head in the same location and position as the dummy head used for the recordings. While watching a virtual empty room through a VR headset, the participants were played three binaural audio recordings as separate conditions: the recording that had been taken from their own ears, in which they heard themselves from their own location (the self-egocentric condition); the recording that had been taken from the dummy, in which they heard themselves from across the room (the self-allocentric condition); and a recording that had been taken of a gender-matched person speaking from across the room (the other-allocentric condition). After each of these conditions, they answered a 14-point questionnaire measuring how closely participants felt that there was another presence in the room, and how closely they identified it as themselves.</p>



<p>In the second block, participants were played audio of either themselves or matched others navigating around the room, reading from an experimental script — “One, two, three, four, five, point at my feet.” Participants were then asked to point a virtual laser pointer to the floor of the location they heard the audio originating from, in order to give a measure of perceived distance from the speaker. After all the trials were done, they answered two questions to assess if they’d had any previous hallucinatory experiences.</p>



<p>Data collected from the 14-item questionnaire indicated that participants strongly felt a presence walking around them while the self-allocentric audio played (they didn’t report a very strong sense of a doppelganger during the self-egocentric audio). Participants also self-identified with that presence, feeling a sense of body ownership and agency when it was linked to their own voice, as opposed to that of the gender-matched others.</p>



<p>These results suggest that some aspects of bodily self-consciousness can be affected by audio in those with no history of psychiatric or neurological issues. These participants experience what the authors describe as an &#8220;auditory doppelganger&#8221;, with whom they strongly self-identify. One participant even went so far as to report that they felt “as if I was going around myself.” This effect may offer a new avenue through which to investigate bodily self-consciousness in experimental settings.</p>



<p>Perhaps most interesting, however, is that when asked to point to the locations voices originated from, those with no history of hallucinations perceived their own voice in the allocentric condition as originating closer to them than the voice of another person. Conversely, those with a history of hallucinations tended to locate their own allocentric voices as further away from themselves than the voices of others.</p>



<p>Though the authors of this paper emphasise that their findings are preliminary, and based on a very small sample in the hallucinator group (N=4), they offer some speculation as to why this difference may exist, citing previous research on patients with psychosis showing reduced capacity to recognise their own voice. However, even if those in the hallucinator group experienced difficulties in distinguishing their own voice, it’s unclear why they would estimate their voice to be <em>further away</em> than the voice of another person. As this finding was contrary to the team’s original expectations, this issue is likely to be more fully explored by future research.</p>



<p>The study was quite small, which may raise questions as to validity and generalisability of these results. Similarly, sorting of participants into those with and without a history of hallucinations was done using two questions, which is perhaps lacking in the detail required to conduct this kind of group separation. Temperature and electro-cardiac measurements taken from participants during the blocks did not differ significantly between conditions, which may also indicate that the experience of a doppelganger was not particularly strong. This research is preliminary in nature, though, and these points can be improved in further studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mineral-diamond-davemaoite-earth-mantle-heat">A mineral found in a diamond’s flaws contains the source of some of Earth’s heat</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to knowing what actually lies deep inside the Earth, diamonds are a geologist’s best friend.</p>



<p>A tiny bit of rock trapped inside a diamond is now opening a brand-new window into what the planet’s lower mantle looks like. Inside the diamond is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abl8568">newly identified silicate mineral dubbed davemaoite</a> that can only have formed in Earth’s lower mantle, researchers report November 12 in <em>Science</em>. It’s the first time that scientists have managed to definitively prove that this type of lower mantle mineral — previously just predicted from laboratory experiments — actually exists in nature. The team <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flaws-make-it-geologists-best-friend">named the mineral</a> for well-known experimental high-pressure geophysicist Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao (<em>SN: 3/16/04</em>).</p>



<p>The diamond bearing the telltale mineral inclusion came from a Botswana mine and formed at depths greater than 660 kilometers, the upper boundary of Earth’s lower mantle. Using analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence imaging and infrared spectroscopy, mineralogist Oliver Tschauner of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and colleagues identified the chemical makeup and structure of the new mineral, pegging it as a type of calcium silicate perovskite.</p>



<p>Scientists had previously estimated that about 5 percent to 7 percent of the lower mantle must be made up of this mineral, Tschauner says. But it’s fiendishly difficult to directly observe such deep-Earth minerals. That’s because minerals that are stable in the intense pressures of the lower mantle — which extends all the way to 2,700 kilometers below Earth’s surface — begin to rearrange their crystal structures as soon as the pressure lets up.</p>





<p>Even the planet’s most common mineral, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-most-abundant-mineral-finally-has-name">a lower mantle magnesium iron silicate known as bridgmanite</a>, was largely theoretical until 2014, when it was discovered to have naturally occurred within a meteorite that had slammed into Australia with a force that generated crushing, deep mantle-like pressures in the rock (<em>SN: 11/27/14</em>). To date, bridgmanite is the only other high-pressure silicate mineral confirmed to exist in nature.</p>



<p>Diamonds act like time capsules, locking in the original mineral forms on their journey to the surface. The discovery of davemaoite is not only a confirmation of its existence, but it also reveals the location of some sources of heat deep inside Earth. Although it’s a calcium silicate mineral, davemaoite is also host to a rogue’s gallery of different elements that sneak into its crystal structure. That includes radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium and potassium, as well as rare-earth elements. Such radioactive elements have long been thought to produce about a third of the heat circulating in the lower mantle (the other two-thirds is left over from the planet’s original formation 4.55 billion years ago). By identifying the chemical makeup of davemaoite, researchers can now confirm where those elements reside.</p>



<p>That’s because the Botswana diamond also contained <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamonds-reveal-sign-deepest-water-known-inside-earth">a high-pressure form of ice</a> as well as another high-pressure mineral known as wüstite (<em>SN: 3/8/18</em>). The presence of those inclusions helped narrow down the rough pressures at which the davemaoite might have formed: somewhere between 24 billion pascals and 35 billion pascals, Tschauner says. It’s hard to say exactly what depth that corresponds to, he adds. But the discovery directly links heat generation (the radioactive materials), the water cycle (the ice) and the carbon cycle (represented by the formation of the diamond itself), all in the deep mantle, Tschauner says.</p>



<p>Another intriguing aspect of this new mineral is that it’s surprisingly rich in potassium compared with laboratory predictions, says Sang-Heon Shim, a geophysicist at Arizona State University in Tempe. Most experimental efforts to create the mineral came up with “nearly pure calcium silicate perovskite,” Shim says. Scientists can only speculate right now what the source was for the extra potassium, but this unexpected composition hints that the lower mantle may be a more motley mix than thought, with complexity difficult to predict from lab studies alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-infertility-pregnancy-false-information">No, COVID-19 vaccines won’t make you infertile</a></h4>

              
                <p>The World Health Organization has warned that the globe is dealing with two pandemics. One is the spread of the coronavirus, but the other, equally dangerous, is the spread of misinformation and disinformation. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">False or misleading information</a> has sprung up about the virus, treatments, vaccines, masks and just about every other aspect of the pandemic (<em>SN: 5/6/21</em>). </p>



<p>Some of these lies or half-truths are purposefully <a href="https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_b7cedc0553604720b7137f8663366ee5.pdf">used by a few people to help sell </a>vitamin supplements, books, and DVDs, or to boost their own influence. But the vast majority of people may have heard misinformation from a friend or relative, seen it on social media or heard it repeated by celebrities or politicians. In a survey of adults in the United States conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly 8 in 10 people <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-media-and-misinformation/">believe or aren’t sure about the truthfulness of at least one common falsehood</a> about the pandemic. About 46 percent of people believe or are unsure about one to three falsehoods related to the pandemic, and 32 percent believe or are uncertain whether four or more erroneous statements are true or false. Only 22 percent of adults in the survey didn’t believe any of the false statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One particularly pernicious rumor is that coronavirus vaccines cause infertility. In the survey, 8 percent of people said they believe that false statement. Another 23 percent of people surveyed weren’t sure whether studies had shown a link between the vaccines and infertility. And it doesn’t help people tell truth from fiction when celebrities spread incorrect information. Recently, the Green Bay Packers’ quarterback <a href="https://people.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-says-fatherhood-is-his-next-great-chapter-worries-covid-vaccine-may-cause-infertility/">Aaron Rodgers said he lied about being vaccinated</a> because of concerns that the COVID-19 vaccine may cause infertility, as <em>People</em> magazine reports. That follows rapper Nicki Minaj’s tweeting that her cousin’s friend in Trinidad had suffered swollen testicles after getting the vaccine. That claim was disputed<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/16/americas/nicki-minaj-vaccine-story-false-scli-intl/index.html"> by the health minister </a>of Trinidad and Tobago, according to <em>CNN</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>It’s not just athletes and celebrities spreading false rumors about COVID-19 vaccines and infertility, however. That misinformation is everywhere. In Kibera, an informal settlement in Kenya’s capital of Nairobi, community health volunteers hear two main concerns about getting the vaccine: “Can I have children after this?” and “Can I have the vaccine if I have diabetes or cancer [or other health problems]?” There’s a split between who is asking those questions, says Eddah Ogogo, the primary healthcare program coordinator for the international nonprofit organization CFK Africa that is helping coordinate vaccine distribution. “The younger population [is] scared about infertility. The older population is scared about comorbidities,” she says.</p>



<p>The easier conversation to have is reassuring people that the vaccine won’t interfere with their medications and may help those with health problems avoid the most serious complications of COVID-19. But, says Ogogo, “when it comes to fertility, there are those who get convinced. They say, ‘Wow! That’s good to know’,” and they get their shot. And then, “there are those who say, ‘I’ll keep asking around and when I get the information I want I will come [get vaccinated].’” Just under <a href="https://www.health.go.ke/">7 percent of adults in Kenya are fully vaccinated</a>, mostly due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lack of access to vaccines</a>, but misinformation plays a role too, Ogogo says (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).</p>

<p>Local and global news outlets alike often make the disclaimer that there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility. But that lackluster response leaves the door open for misinterpretation or rumors of a cover-up. In fact, there is evidence that the vaccines<strong><em> </em></strong><em>do not</em> cause infertility. One study found that there was <a href="https://www.fertstertreports.org/article/S2666-3341(21)00068-4/fulltext">no difference in pregnancy rates after embryo transfers</a> in women who had antibodies against the coronavirus from vaccination or infection compared with women who had no antibodies, researchers reported in <em>Fertility and Sterility Reports</em> in September. In clinical trials testing the vaccines, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00525-y/tables/1">accidental pregnancies</a> happened in both the vaccine group and the unvaccinated control group at similar rates, data posted in the April <em>Nature Reviews Immunology</em> show. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02282-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">Miscarriage rates were also similar</a>, researchers reported in a <em>Lancet</em> study published October 21 look at pregnancies in the AstraZeneca vaccine trial. </p>



<p>Real-world data from Israel of more than 15,000 pregnant women also shows the benefits of the vaccine. About half of the pregnant people were vaccinated with the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. Only about 2 percent got infected with the coronavirus — mostly between their first and second shots. But among unvaccinated women, the infection rate continued to climb, reaching about 4 percent by the end of the study, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782047">suggesting that vaccination can prevent infection during pregnancy</a>, researchers reported in July in <em>JAMA</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s good news because pregnant <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3320">women who get COVID-19 are more likely to deliver their babies prematurely</a> and may be admitted to the intensive care unit or die at a higher rate than uninfected women, a study of studies published last year in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> found. And men who get COVID-19 may have <a href="https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.200134">lower levels of testosterone</a> and <a href="https://cuaj.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/7292">low sperm counts</a> after infection, and may be more likely to have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450276/">erectile dysfunction</a>, three studies show. It’s not clear whether any of those problems continue long-term.</p>



<p>But those are consequences of COVID-19, not the vaccines. The Pfizer mRNA <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781360">vaccine did not harm sperm production</a>, researchers reported in June in <em>JAMA</em>, adding to the mounting evidence that vaccines are safe. That fact may eventually percolate down to people who are scared that getting the vaccine will damage their fertility.</p>



<p>In its<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240035966"> latest report on managing “the infodemic</a>” — the deluge of information about COVID-19, both true and false, that people encounter every day — the WHO laid out both short- and long-term strategies for making people less vulnerable to misinformation. One thing is clear though, the report states. “Both innocent circulation of misinformation and malicious disinformation campaigns have triggered actions across the globe that put [people] at a higher risk of spreading the coronavirus and making them more liable to harming their health.”</p>



<p>The U.S. Surgeon General’s office put together a handy<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/health-misinformation-checklist-english.pdf"> checklist </a>to help people vet the information they’re seeing or hearing. The checklist is part of a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/health-misinformation/index.html#community-toolkit">toolkit</a> for teaching people how to combat misinformation in their own communities, including talking — preferably in-person rather than online — to friends and family members who may have bought into conspiracy theories. “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/surgeon-general-releases-guide-combating-covid-19-vaccine/story?id=81043760">We need people in communities all across our country to have these conversations,</a>” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told ABC news. If the Kaiser survey is any indication, there’s no shortage of folks who could benefit from such discussions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-m87-galaxy-jets-plasma-simulation">A stunning simulation re-creates how M87’s black hole launches plasma jets</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the maw of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, two enormous jets stream thousands of light-years into space. Scientists still don’t fully understand the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">physics behind the jets</a>, which are made of a mix of electrically charged particles, or plasma (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>). But they are “really, really amazing,” says astrophysicist Alejandro Cruz-Osorio of Goethe University Frankfurt. So he and colleagues created a computer simulation of M87’s black hole and the swirling gas that surrounds it in an accretion disk. The aim: Figure out how this black hole — already <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">famous for posing for a picture</a> in 2019 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>) — became such a jet-setter.</p>



<p>Under the right conditions, that simulation produces <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01506-w">jets that match observations</a> of M87, the researchers report November 4 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. The black hole twists up spiraling magnetic fields that surround two high-energy beams of electrons and other charged particles. The results suggest that the black hole must be spinning rapidly, at more than half its maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics and possibly as much as 94 percent of its maximum possible speed.</p>



<p>Getting the energies of the jets’ electrons right turned out to be crucial. When magnetic fields in the jets rearrange in a process known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-magnetic-field-hair-computer-simulations-physics">magnetic reconnection</a> (<em>SN: 8/3/21</em>), electrons get accelerated, resulting in more of them having very high energies. This effect was not included in earlier simulations, but it was key to getting the simulated jets to act like real-world counterparts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pearl-symmetry-round-formation-oysters-nacre-math">Researchers have unlocked the secret to pearls’ incredible symmetry</a></h4>

              
                <p>For centuries, researchers have puzzled over how oysters grow stunningly symmetrical, perfectly round pearls around irregularly shaped grains of sand or bits of debris. Now a team has shown that oysters, mussels and other mollusks use a complex process to grow the gems that follows mathematical rules seen throughout nature.</p>



<p>Pearls are formed when an irritant gets trapped inside a mollusk, and the animal protects itself by building smooth layers of mineral and protein — together called nacre — around it. Each new layer of nacre built over this asymmetrical center adapts precisely to the ones preceding it, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/42/e2107477118">smoothing out irregularities</a> to result in a round pearl, according to an analysis published October 19 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>“Nacre is this incredibly beautiful, iridescent, shiny material that we see in the insides of some seashells or on the outside of pearls,” says Laura Otter, a biogeochemist at the Australian National University in Canberra.</p>



<p>A pearl’s symmetrical growth as it lays down layers of nacre relies on the mollusk balancing two basic capabilities, Otter and her colleagues discovered. It corrects growth aberrations that appear as the pearl forms, preventing those variations from propagating over the pearl’s many layers. Otherwise, the resulting gem would be lopsided.</p>





<p>Additionally, the mollusk modulates the thickness of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/pearl-coating-inspires-tougher-ceramics">nacre layers</a>, so that if one layer is especially thick, subsequent layers will be thinner in response (<em>SN: 3/24/14</em>). This helps the pearl maintain a similar average thickness over its thousands of layers so that it looks perfectly round and uniform. Without that constant adjustment, a pearl might resemble stratified sedimentary rock, amplifying small imperfections that detract from its spherical shape.</p>



<p>The researchers studied keshi pearls collected from Akoya pearl oysters (<em>Pinctada imbricata fucata</em>) at an eastern Australia coastal pearl farm. They used a diamond wire saw to cut the pearls into cross sections, then polished and examined the gems using Raman spectroscopy, a nondestructive technique that allowed them to characterize the pearls’ structure. For one of the pearls showcased in the paper, they counted 2,615 layers, which were deposited over 548 days.</p>

<p>The analysis revealed that fluctuations in the thicknesses of the pearls’ layers of nacre exhibit a phenomenon called 1/f noise, or pink noise, in which events that appear to be random are actually connected. In this case, the formation of nacre layers of different thicknesses may appear random, but is actually dependent on the thickness of previous layers. The same phenomenon is at work in seismic activity: The rumbling of the ground seems random, but is actually connected to previous recent seismic activity. Pink noise also crops up in classical music and even when monitoring heartbeats and brain activity, says coauthor Robert Hovden, a materials scientist and engineer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. &nbsp;These phenomena “belong to a universal class of behavior and physics,” Hovden says.</p>



<p>This is the first time that researchers have reported “that nacre self-heals and when a defect arises, it heals itself within a few [layers], without using an external scaffolding or template,” says Pupa Gilbert, a physicist studying biomineralization at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who wasn’t involved with the study. “Nacre is an even more remarkable material than we had previously appreciated.”</p>



<p>Notes Otter: “These humble creatures are making a super light and super tough material so much more easily and better than we do with all our technology.” Made of just calcium, carbonate and protein, nacre is “3,000 times tougher than the materials from which it’s made of.”</p>



<p>This new understanding of pearls, Hovden adds, could inspire “the next generation of super materials,” such as more energy-efficient solar panels or tough and heat-resistant materials optimized for use in spacecraft.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Mentioning the uncanny valley often brings one thing to mind — creepy dolls. The phenomenon, in which near-human-looking faces produce an inexplicable uneasy reaction in those who view them, was actually first described as an issue faced by roboticists. But the faces of dolls in particular are a cultural touchstone for uncanny feelings — at least in part due to their (over)use as a spooking-device in hundreds of horror movies over the years.</p>



<p>As such, psychological research has been conducted on the subtleties that non-human facial structure and expression can have on producing feelings of unease in those who view them. However, the uncanny valley isn’t just confined to faces, and its effects are not confined to just a horror movie device. For example, research from Burcu Urgen of Bilkent University demonstrates that biological-like motion can also trigger uncanny feelings, which poses real issues for those pushing the frontiers of robotics.</p>



<span id="more-44484"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393218301684">One of her studies from 2018</a> looked at the uncanny valley through the lens of expectation violations. For this experiment, 19 student participants from the University of California were strapped into EEGs and asked to view video clips of either a mechanical robot, an android (which was the same robot, but with a very realistic skin), or the human that the android was modelled after.</p>



<p>In these clips, each of the agents carries out a simple movement, such as wiping a desk or lifting a cup. In half of these trials, the video was paused on the first frame for between 600ms and 1500ms, in order to provide motionless control measurements, whereas in the other trials the video played instantly.</p>



<p>Analyses focused on a pattern of brain activity called the N400 — a relatively large spike in neural activity that occurs 400 milliseconds after seeing something that violates your expectations. The relationship between the N400 and expectation violations is well established, and has been demonstrated to be a good indicator that people’s expectations have been violated during a variety of tasks such as reading, looking at faces, and interpreting gestures.</p>



<p>The research team found large spikes in the N400 during the android robot’s movements, but not when it was static during those paused first frames. There was no indication of expectation violation when either the mechanical robot or human performed the same movements. Taken together, this means that the surprisingly mechanical movements of an otherwise human-like robot, but not the overall form or design of the robot, were what set it apart. This non-matching, or &#8220;incongruence&#8221;, was the main issue.</p>



<p>“In our study, it was the incongruence of appearance and movement of the agent [that] led people to think that it would move biologically, since we know from our prior experience in the world that agents that look biological move biologically,” Dr Urgen shared with us. “However, when it [didn’t], it violated people&#8217;s expectations.”</p>



<p>But it may not be this way forever. The usual uncanny feelings may not arise once we come to understand that life-like robots don&#8217;t always move in a biological manner (or indeed, that some mechanical-looking robots can actually move with fluidity and grace &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atZfX85nd4">just think of the dogs created by Boston Dynamics</a>). “The main point about our &#8220;expectation violation&#8221; explanation of the uncanny valley supported by N400 data is that we use our prior knowledge when we are processing our environment, and constantly predict what comes next,” Dr Urgen explains. “This implies that if our prior knowledge with robots changes, our expectations and what we predict will change as well. So, if we get more familiar with robots over long periods of time, it is possible that we may begin to move past the valley.”</p>



<p>And this is exactly what’s on the cards for Dr Urgen and her lab. In the near future, they plan to take a closer look at the effect of participants’ age on how much robots violate expectations. For example, younger generations who have grown up around technology may be more likely to expect miraculously human feats from robotic agents than older generations. This could also feasibly vary by culture; one could envision a Japanese population, for instance, perhaps being more familiar with the idea of a robot moving biologically than one from say, Peru.</p>



<p>Future research could also look at other features that produce uncanny feelings, Dr Urgen says. “I think this expectation violation issue is not limited to appearance-movement congruence. Our real world experience is multimodal in nature. For instance, the congruence between appearance and voice may also be important.”</p>



<p>Research into these factors informs robotic design and, in the near future, may provide a long-sought-after quantitative measure of the uncanny valley. In theory, N400 readings could be measured while participants view new robotic designs, allowing roboticists to more sensitively and quickly tweak their models into non-eerie territory.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;Simulating and Reconstructing Neurodynamics with Epsilon-Automata Applied to Electroencephalography (EEG) Microstate Sequences&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We introduce new techniques to the analysis of neural spatiotemporal
dynamics via applying -machine reconstruction to
electroencephalography (EEG) microstate sequences. Microstates are
short duration quasi-stable states of the dynamically changing
electrical field topographies recorded via an array of electrodes from
the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The sequence
of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. -machines are
discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities
on different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG
microstate). They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an
optimally predictive manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics
emulating the behaviour of the source. Here we present experiments
using both simulations and empirical data supporting the value of
associating these discrete dynamical systems with mental states (e.g.
mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical
populations can then be further characterized by properties of these
dynamical systems, including: i) statistical complexity (determined by
the number of states of the corresponding -automaton); ii) entropy
rate; iii) characteristic sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic
grammars); iv) duration, persistence and stability of dynamical
patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as Krohn-Rhodes complexity or
holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The potential
applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being
interventions, human-machine interface, and others on both subject-
specific and group/population-level.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The number of people referred in the UK to mental health services for a suspected first ever episode of psychosis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/18/psychosis-cases-soar-in-england-as-pandemic-hits-mental-health">rose by nearly a third between April 2019 and April 2021</a>. The stresses of COVID-19 have been blamed. Ideally, these people would have been identified as being at-risk before they first experienced the hallucinations and/or delusions that characterise the condition. That’s because early treatment can work to delay or even prevent a first episode from occurring.</p>



<p>Research has revealed a suite of symptoms that can occur in this preceding period. These include odd or eccentric behaviours and ideas, unusual perceptual experiences, and suspiciousness — as well as hallucinations and delusions, but not at the level required for a diagnosis of psychosis. Non-psychotic early symptoms have been identified, too, such as anxiety, self-harm, sleep disturbance, depression and memory problems. Now a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/dynamic-association-of-the-first-identifiable-symptom-with-rapidity-of-progression-to-firstepisode-psychosis/1BB59D3D4043597540F8972C23EB9417">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Medicine</em> reveals which early symptoms, exactly, are associated with a faster than average progression to a first episode of psychosis — and also more symptoms later — and which are not.</p>



<span id="more-44477"></span>



<p>Vincent Paquin at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Canada led a study of 390 patients aged between 14 and 35 who attended a prevention and early intervention program for psychosis. Based on interviews with the patients themselves and also family members, the team identified the occurrence and timing of 27 psychosis-linked symptoms as well as the date of each patient’s first episode diagnosis.</p>



<p>The median time between the first symptom (of any kind) occurring and a first episode was 3.83 years. The team did find some age-related effects, however. For example, when odd/eccentric behaviours or social withdrawal were the first symptom and they appeared after the age of 17 or 18, this was associated with a shorter time to a first episode.</p>



<p>But one first symptom in particular stood out as being related to a faster progression; not delusions, or hallucinations, as might perhaps have been suspected — but suspiciousness.</p>



<p>Why might this be? “Suspiciousness implies a cognitive interpretation of the environment as being hostile, which may make a stronger building block for illness progression, potentially through the emergence of anxiety, delusions and greater fear from hallucinations,” the researchers write. Perceptual disturbances did not emerge as being informative perhaps because they are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/24/a-key-brain-difference-between-voice-hearing-patients-and-voice-hearing-healthy-controls-challenges-the-continuum-model/">relatively frequent in the general population</a>, they add.</p>



<p>The team also found that a younger age of onset of suspiciousness was associated with more symptoms later. “Suspiciousness emerging before adolescence could be a stronger risk factor for poorer social adjustment, eg bullying, aggression,” the team writes. It might even start a vicious cycle of ever worsening behaviour and stress exposure, and poorer social perceptions, with psychopathology the end result.</p>



<p>A few links with non-psychotic symptoms also emerged. For example, sleep disturbance as a first symptom was associated with the development of more symptoms later on. There were also some links between self-harm, depression and anxiety and a slower progression to a first episode diagnosis. However, earlier work has found that a slower progression is associated with a poorer long-term outcome, the team notes. So knowing which first symptoms are linked to a slower progression is important, too.</p>



<p>The researchers themselves stress that this work was “exploratory”, and much more work is needed to explore the links identified here. In principle, though, “simple associations between early symptoms and the rapidity of illness progression can help tailor the intensity and timing of early interventions in at-risk individuals,” they conclude.</p>



<p>Perhaps examining the symptoms of other mental health conditions individually, rather than lumping them together, could help fine-tune early interventions for other illnesses, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780374157357">The Dawn of Everything</a><br><em>David Graeber and David Wengrow</em><br><em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $35</em></p>



<p>Concerns abound about what’s gone wrong in modern societies. Many scholars explain growing gaps between the haves and the have-nots as partly a by-product of living in dense, urban populations. The bigger the crowd, from this perspective, the more we need power brokers to run the show. Societies have scaled up for thousands of years, which has magnified the distance between the wealthy and those left wanting.</p>



<p>In <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow challenge the assumption that bigger societies inevitably produce a range of inequalities. Using examples from past societies, the pair also rejects the popular idea that social evolution occurred in stages.</p>





<p>Such stages, according to conventional wisdom, began with humans living in small hunter-gatherer bands where everyone was on equal footing. Then an agricultural revolution about 12,000 years ago fueled population growth and the emergence of tribes, then chiefdoms and eventually bureaucratic states. Or perhaps murderous alpha males dominated ancient hunter-gatherer groups. If so, early states may have represented attempts to corral our selfish, violent natures.</p>



<p>Neither scenario makes sense to Graeber and Wengrow. Their research synthesis — which extends for 526 pages — paints a more hopeful picture of social life over the last 30,000 to 40,000 years. For most of that time, the authors argue, humans have tactically alternated between small and large social setups. Some social systems featured ruling elites, working stiffs and enslaved people. Others emphasized decentralized, collective decision making. Some were run by men, others by women. The big question — one the authors can’t yet answer — is why, after tens of thousands of years of social flexibility, many people today can’t conceive of how society might effectively be reorganized.</p>





<p>Hunter-gatherers have a long history of revamping social systems from one season to the next, the authors write. About a century ago, researchers observed that Indigenous populations in North America and elsewhere often operated in small, mobile groups for part of the year and crystallized into large, sedentary communities the rest of the year. For example, each winter, Canada’s Northwest Coast Kwakiutl hunter-gatherers built wooden structures where nobles ruled over designated commoners and enslaved people, and held banquets called potlatch. In summers, aristocratic courts disbanded, and clans with less formal social ranks fished along the coast.</p>



<p>Many Late Stone Age hunter-gatherers similarly assembled and dismantled social systems on a seasonal basis, evidence gathered over the last few decades suggests. Scattered discoveries of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-humans-avoided-inbreeding-networking">elaborate graves for apparently esteemed individuals</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stonehenge-roots-wales-stone-circle-archaeology">huge structures made of stone</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>), mammoth bones and other material dot Eurasian landscapes. The graves may hold individuals who were accorded special status, at least at times of the year when mobile groups formed large communities and built large structures, the authors speculate. Seasonal gatherings to conduct rituals and feasts probably occurred at the monumental sites. No signs of centralized power, such as palaces or storehouses, accompany those sites.</p>



<p>Social flexibility and experimentation, rather than a revolutionary shift, also characterized ancient transitions to agriculture, Graeber and Wengrow write. Middle Eastern village excavations now indicate that the domestication of cereals and other crops occurred in fits and starts from around 12,000 to 9,000 years ago. Ancient Fertile Crescent communities periodically gave farming a go while still hunting, foraging, fishing and trading. Early cultivators were in no rush to treat tracts of land as private property or to form political systems headed by kings, the authors conclude.</p>



<p>Even in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-urban-megasites-may-reshape-history-first-cities">early cities of Mesopotamia and Eurasia around 6,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/20</em>), absolute rule by monarchs did not exist. Collective decisions were made by district councils and citizen assemblies, archaeological evidence suggests. In contrast, authoritarian, violent political systems appeared in the region’s mobile, nonagricultural populations at that time.</p>



<p>Early states formed in piecemeal fashion, the authors argue. These political systems incorporated one or more of three basic elements of domination: violent control of the masses by authorities, bureaucratic management of special knowledge and information, and public demonstrations of rulers’ power and charisma. Egypt’s early rulers more than 4,000 years ago fused violent coercion of their subjects with extensive bureaucratic controls over daily affairs. Classic Maya rulers in Central America 1,100 years ago or more relied on administrators to monitor cosmic events while grounding earthly power in violent control and alliances with other kings.</p>



<p>States can take many forms, though. Graeber and Wengrow point to Bronze Age Minoan society on Crete as an example of a political system run by priestesses who called on citizens to transcend individuality via ecstatic experiences that bound the population together.</p>



<p>What seems to have changed today is that basic social liberties have receded, the authors contend. The freedom to relocate to new kinds of communities, to disobey commands issued by others and to create new social systems or alternate between different ones has become a scarce commodity. Finding ways to reclaim that freedom is a major challenge.</p>



<p>These examples give just a taste of the geographic and historical ground covered by the authors. Shortly after finishing writing the book, Graeber, who died in 2020, tweeted: “My brain feels bruised with numb surprise.” That sense of revelation animates this provocative take on humankind’s social journey.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-songbird-migration-east-west-climate-change">Some songbirds now migrate east to west. Climate change may play a role</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the chill of autumn encroaches on Siberia’s grasslands, Richard’s pipits usually begin their southward trek to warmer latitudes. But a growing number of the slender, larklike songbirds seem to be heading west instead, possibly establishing a new migratory route for the species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would be the first new route known to emerge <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01354-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982221013543%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">on an east-west axis in a long-distance migratory bird</a>, researchers report October 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The finding could have implications for how scientists understand the evolution of bird migration routes over time and how the animals adapt to a shifting climate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard’s pipits (<em>Anthus richardi</em>) typically breed in Siberia during the summer and travel south for the winter to southern Asia. Occasionally, “vagrant” birds get lost and show up far from this range, including in Europe. But as a Ph.D. student at the Université Grenoble Alpes in France, evolutionary biologist Paul Dufour noticed, along with colleagues, that described sightings and photo records of the pipits wintering in southern France had increased from a handful of birds annually in the 1980s and 1990s to many dozens in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Dufour, now at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, and his team started monitoring the pipits in France and Spain to see where the birds were coming from, and if the birds were visiting Europe on purpose or just getting lost.</p>



<p>The researchers captured seven pipits in France during the winter of 2019–2020, tagging them with a sensor that estimates the birds’ geographic positions based on light levels and length of day. The team then released the birds. The next winter, the team successfully recaptured three of them. Those sensors showed that the birds had all flown back to the same part of southwestern Siberia for the summer before returning to France.<br><br>The researchers also examined images in citizen-science databases of 331 Richard’s pipits that were photographed in Europe and North Africa, categorizing the birds by apparent age. Among songbirds, Dufour says, vagrants are always young birds. Songbirds tend to follow a route based on instincts written into their DNA, replicating the trip their ancestors took. But storms or mutations that create faulty wayfinding abilities can send young songbirds off target.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline-800x450.jpg" alt="image of a Richard’s pipit perched on grass in Spain" class="wp-image-3105513" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_JB_bird-migration_inline.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105513">Richard’s pipits normally spend the winter in southern Asia, but a new migration route seems to be bringing them to European places like Galicia, Spain, where this pipit was photographed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105513">Daniel Lopez-Velasco</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Wherever it arrives, the songbird’s first migration creates a mental map for every migration after, so any adult birds in Europe have made the trip more than once. Since more than half of the birds in southern Europe and nearby northwestern Africa documented in the winter were adults, Dufour and his colleagues think that many of these pipits are seasonal migrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contemporary shifts in migration routes are more common in species that travel via the cues of a traveling group, like geese or cranes. Songbirds usually migrate alone, following their instinctual route when young, Dufour says, so changes to migration patterns are rarer.</p>





<p>What’s more, east-west migration is unusual in birds. Most species that travel this way are ones that migrate short distances within the tropics, says Jessie Williamson, an ornithologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who was not involved with the research.&nbsp;“It’s exciting that an understudied migratory behavior like east-west migration is in the spotlight,” she says.</p>



<p>If the pipits’ European trek is in fact now an established route, it’s possible that the detour was facilitated by climate change, which may also be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-why-birds-are-migrating-earlier-across-united-states">meddling with birds’ migrations in other ways</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 12/17/19</em>). Dufour and his team used computer models that estimate climate suitability for the pipits in Europe based on variables like temperature and precipitation. The researchers compared two periods — 1961 to 1990 and 1990 to 2018 — and found that warmer temperatures in the latter period have made most parts of southern Europe a better wintering location for the birds than they were before.</p>





<p>The selection of European wintering grounds may also involve the deterioration of ancestral, southern Asian sites, but the researchers haven’t investigated that yet. Climate change could be affecting that too, Dufour says. But “we suspect that habitat modification in Southeast Asia — increasing urbanization, less open areas — may also be part of the equation.”</p>



<p>Ginny Chan, an ecologist at the Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach who was not involved with the research, says that the types of environmental changes that could be hurting bird populations “are happening very quickly in the traditional wintering range [for Richard’s pipits] in South and East Asia.” In India, the Richard’s pipit population has declined by <a href="https://www.stateofindiasbirds.in/">more than 90 percent</a> over the last couple of decades, Chan says.</p>



<p>Other Siberian bird species that typically migrate south but have recently shown up in Europe in growing numbers, like the yellow-browed warbler and Siberian chiffchaff, may also be making their own westward routes, Dufour suspects.</p>



<p>If other Siberian songbird species are also establishing new western migration&nbsp;routes, this could mean that migratory songbirds are more flexible travelers than scientists previously thought, Dufour says.</p>



<p>That could have hopeful implications for some birds as species worldwide deal with a changing climate. But the new research, he adds, shouldn’t overshadow other studies of migratory birds — like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218307450">barnacle geese</a> and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35077063?foxtrotcallback=true">European pied flycatcher</a> — which show that some of these species are not as able to cope with climate change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/penis-worms-hermit-lifestyle-crab-shells">‘Penis worms’ may have been the original hermits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hermit crabs have been taking shelter in abandoned shells for millions of years, but scientists now have evidence suggesting that the “hermit” lifestyle has existed far longer than that.</p>



<p>Besides hermit crabs, a few modern-day species of crustaceans and worms inhabit the cast-off shells of other marine creatures, mostly for protection against predators, says Martin Smith, a paleontologist at Durham University in England. Until recently, the oldest known fossils suggesting hermiting behavior were about 170 million years old, he says.</p>



<p>Now, Smith and his colleagues say that they have unearthed fossils of hermiting creatures almost three times that age, from a geologic period dubbed the Cambrian.</p>



<p>Remains of the ancient squatters were preserved in rocks laid down as seafloor sediments about 500 million years ago in what is now southern China. The cone-shaped shells that seem to hold the occupants probably had belonged to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-oddball-invertebrate-finds-its-place-tree-life">hyoliths</a>, a once-common group of ancient marine invertebrates that died out more than 250 million years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>The marine creatures that then took shelter in those vacant shells, the researchers say, belong to a group called priapulid worms — commonly known as penis worms, thanks to their suggestive body shape. &nbsp;The Chinese rocks contain dozens of empty shells, Smith says. But <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01357-9">four of those shells appear to have been inhabited by penis worms</a>, he and his colleagues report November 8 in <em>Current Biology.</em> Because there were no free-ranging priapulids preserved in the ancient sediments, the researchers propose that the worms were living inside the shells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="416" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline.jpg" alt="image of a fossilized penis worm in a shell" class="wp-image-3105534" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline-626x383.jpg 626w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521_sp_penis-worms_inline-304x186.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105534">Fossils of penis worms seemingly occupying the empty shells of another marine creature (one shown) suggest that the “hermiting” lifestyle existed about 330 million years earlier than scientists had realized.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105534">Xi-guang Zhang/Yunnan University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A relatively consistent ratio between the size of a worm and the shell it was preserved within suggests that the animals picked a shell based on its size and then moved to another when they outgrew their adopted home, Smith says. Modern-day hermit crabs use the same strategy, though none of the 20 species of penis worms around today have this hermiting behavior.</p>



<p>The researchers “have made some good observations to support their claims” that the association between the shells and the penis worms isn’t merely fortuitous, says Jakob Vinther, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England who wasn’t involved in the research. It’s not clear, however, whether the priapulids carried the shells from place to place, like hermit crabs do, or whether the animals merely lived inside them, he says.</p>



<p>A great variety of creatures — including most of the major groups of animals alive today and a proliferation of predators — evolved rapidly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-fossil-cache-cambrian-explosion">during the Cambrian Period</a>, which began about 542 million years ago (<em>SN: 3/21/19</em>). As a result, many researchers refer to that explosion of diversity as “life’s Big Bang.”</p>



<p>“Perhaps it’s not a surprise that some priapulids became hermits when you think about what this predatory arms race was all about: eating, ducking and hiding,” Vinther says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Early in the pandemic, there was a rapid shift in the pace of research. With the situation evolving quickly, lockdowns coming into effect, and the massive loss of life that followed, researchers across academia were racing against the clock to produce papers.</p>



<p>This haste was unusual for most scientists, more used to detailed scrutiny, further investigations, and collaboration. As a result, some were concerned about the rigour of papers that would ultimately see the light of day. Early on, psychologist <a href="https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20">Vaughan Bell tweeted</a> with regards to Covid research, &#8220;If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right&#8221;. Now, almost two years into the pandemic, we can begin to assess how robust our efforts were, and see where developments are leading us.</p>



<span id="more-44455"></span>



<p><strong>An imperfect world</strong><br>There is no escaping the fact that some initial fears about the quality of Covid research (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3dx8t227">mentioned in our May 2020 piece</a>) did come to pass. It was always going to be the case that an expedited timeline, as well as the torrent of Covid-related papers — some estimates have it at over 200,000 papers in 2020 — would bend traditional publication frameworks to breaking point.</p>



<p>As early as August 2020, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395946/">systematic review by Inés Nieto and colleagues</a>&nbsp;highlighted that while the majority of mental health research pertaining to Covid did report the expected statistical and methodological information, the reliance on convenience samples, lack of power analyses, and lack of pre-registration called into question both their generalisability and validity.</p>



<p>And this was not by any means an issue unique to psychology. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21220-5">systematic review from February 2021</a>, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, looked at the quality of published research on Covid during 2020 compared to papers from before the pandemic began. When compared with non-Covid articles published in the same journal before the pandemic, Covid papers generally achieved lower quality scores. They were also subject to substantially shorter turnaround times; on average, Covid papers had just 13 days from submission to acceptance, as opposed to a typical 110 days for pre-pandemic papers. Out of the 686 articles on Covid included in their systematic evaluation, Covid research generally achieved modest methodological quality scores, though low journal impact score and rapid turnarounds in particular were in many cases associated with significantly lower methodological quality.</p>



<p>The sheer speed at which research moved did lead to some questionable papers slipping through the net of peer review. As Michael Scheeringa notes in a blog post for&nbsp;<em>Psychology Today</em>, some researchers from outside of psychological disciplines also tried their hand at psychological research to varying success. Others from within psychological disciplines swiftly drew tenuous links between their work and Covid to ride the wave to swift publications and impact. Retraction Watch currently lists over 160 Covid papers that have been withdrawn or retracted from journals, many of which fall within the boundaries of cognitive sciences. What’s more, even though these papers were retracted, the potential damage done by many of the questionable findings within them continues. Thanks to other researchers scooping up Covid research as soon as possible, many will have already been cited in other articles before they were caught and retracted, leading to a proliferation of inaccuracies.</p>



<p>This particular problem spread beyond just peer reviewed work. In an effort to overcome delays imposed by peer review, masses of pre-prints were uploaded to repositories. And while this increased speed and access to novel findings, it also resulted in unchecked studies being treated similarly to peer-reviewed articles, and risky citations by both scientists and media. Tweaks that would come about during review were undoubtedly lost in many cases, which may prove difficult to correct in the coming months. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, even though typical research and publication frameworks bent and broke in some places, that doesn’t mean that we dropped the ball — rather, the urgency with which we needed to move superseded the risk of letting a percentage of imperfect papers see the light of day. In an ideal world, every Covid-related paper would have been immaculate. But researchers are human, and the situation was unprecedented in the truest sense of the word. This is important to remember as we turn attention to how we managed to rapidly reconfigure our research processes into systems that met the moment.</p>



<p><strong>Organised efforts</strong><br>In the wake of social distancing, formats such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194880/">letters to the editor</a> and social media (particularly Twitter) became powerful ways to spotlight areas in need of urgent research and organise efforts to rapidly fill those gaps. For example, the <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/october-2020/massive-collaboration">Psychological Science Accelerator</a> — a distributed network of labs that collaborate on studies to increase the generalisability of findings on chosen research projects — quickly created the Rapid Response Covid-19 Project, creating calls for collaboration via social media. The three chosen projects focus on loss gain, cognitive reappraisal, and self determination. As of writing, all have been <a href="https://psysciacc.org/2021/09/30/news-from-the-accelerator-september-2021/">submitted for peer review</a>, and the study on cognitive reappraisal has been published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01173-x"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>.</p>



<p>In a commendable move, several large journals, including Elsevier, also made all of their Covid-related publications Open Access. This effectively removed institutional access barriers from those seeking to contribute to Covid efforts, and reduced access issues caused by working from home. And in response to the tidal wave of pre-prints, many repositories got pickier about the types of submissions they allow in order to ensure things that absolutely required peer review (such as predictions about potential treatments) received it.</p>



<p>Following the flurry of papers in early 2020 that focused on the spread of Covid, research on the mental health impacts of the pandemic have more recently taken centre stage. According to analyses in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>, from November 2020, papers on mental health and Covid outpaced PubMed publication rates from other disciplines such as public health, diagnostics, and even epidemiology.</p>



<p>Valuable psychological insights, new issues, and new approaches have begun to emerge from the chaos. Several topics are likely to be of great relevance in the coming years, both for clinicians and academics. Here are just a few of those research topics that we are beginning to cover in more depth now that some of the dust is settling.</p>



<p><strong>Brain fog</strong><br>Following Covid recovery, many people report experiencing a wide array of extended symptoms, which have collectively been dubbed Long Covid. Many of these symptoms are neuropsychological, and while theories exist as to what may be causing these symptoms, no single mechanism has been agreed upon yet.</p>



<p>One of the more widespread and under-supported cognitive consequences of Long Covid is brain fog. Though it is not a diagnosis in itself, the condition is widely recognised by medical professionals, poses severe issues for those going through chemotherapy, and is prevalent among those with HIV, as well as other conditions. Despite this, misinformed associations between brain fog and malingering persist in the general population, creating extensive barriers to treatment.</p>



<p>To illustrate the difficulties faced by those suffering from post-Covid brain fog, researchers based at Oxford University&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.21261740v1">recently published a qualitative study</a>&nbsp;which takes a detailed look at brain fog sufferers’ lived experiences. Recruiting via online support groups, the discussions participants had during small focus groups detail the life changing impacts of cognitive impairment, from difficulties completing the weekly shop to extensive struggles with dismissive healthcare professionals. Several experienced issues conducting their jobs, and while some recovered over the course of the study, many did not, suggesting this may become a widespread longstanding issue for both patients and healthcare professionals going forward.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350">research suggesting</a> that around 81% of those with Long Covid may experience brain fog, there is an urgent need for specialised health and support services that are easily navigable by those suffering from the symptoms of brain fog, such as extremely low energy, confusion, and poor memory, to name a few.</p>



<p><strong>Transitioning from the ICU</strong><br>Through the course of the pandemic, there have been thousands of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions within the UK. A large number of these were older individuals, as may be expected, but a remarkable number were also younger, generally healthy individuals. For all patients, the shock of being admitted to ICU and their experiences while being treated are extreme, and for many can make readjusting to everyday life a struggle. Some researchers have wondered whether Post-Intensive Care Syndrome may pose a &#8220;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350">crisis after a crisis</a>&#8220;. Cognitive deficits and mood disorders are common in those who survive the ICU, with 47% suffering from depression or anxiety even two years post-ICU. Social factors stemming from physical injuries, such as financial instability or changes in identity may exacerbate this further in times of Covid.</p>



<p>Though research in this area with regards to Covid is still somewhat immature, psychologists such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301100/">Adam Guck and colleagues</a>&nbsp;have drawn from extensive existing literature on the psychological consequences of ICU stays with different diseases to create a probable list of psychological issues Covid patients may face post-ICU.</p>



<p>Using existing publications on Covid, SARS, MERS, conditions requiring ventilation, and other considerable medical interventions, the team identified five broad areas of issues that commonly occur in post-ICU patients: medical trauma and post-traumatic stress, cognitive deficits, fatigue and depression, social stress and readjustment, and illness anxiety. Combining this with their own observations, the authors then provide treatment recommendations for each of these areas, with emphasis on those that can be delivered as outpatient or telemedical interventions.</p>



<p>These sorts of recommendations are a promising start, and several academics highlight the need for future research to verify the efficacy of suggested approaches, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and diaphragmatic breathing, in Covid populations. It may be the case that cognitive behavioural therapy’s effect may be lessened by cognitive difficulties particular to Covid recovery, or that typical breathing exercises may draw attention to negative emotions or lasting physical effects concerning the respiratory system. Similarly, ensuring that therapies are effective across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will be vital to the world’s recovery from Covid.</p>



<p><strong>Prolonged Grief Disorder</strong><br>Millions of families around the world have been faced with the sudden death of loved ones due to Covid. Beyond this tragedy, the shock of these losses, combined in part with the disruption of typical death and mourning rituals, appears to have given rise to Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD).</p>



<p>PGD is a condition recently added to the DSM and ICD in response to ongoing mass death due to Covid, as well as other natural disasters and wars. Those with the condition experience bereavement difficulties which persist or grow, rather than diminishing over time, and can remain indefinitely without treatment.</p>



<p>Pre-Covid prevalence estimates sit at around 10 to 20% for the recently bereaved. However, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263919392_Prolonged_Grief_Disorder_Diagnostic_Assessment_and_Treatment_Considerations">some initial estimates</a> of PGD’s prevalence during the pandemic within <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-021-00669-5">Chinese populations</a> place this figure much higher. Using online versions of the International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale and the Traumatic Grief Inventory Self Report, researchers Suqin Tang and Zhendong Xiang assessed grief in 422 Chinese participants who had recently lost a loved one to Covid. From this, they were able to arrive at an estimate that between 29 and 38% of participants were experiencing symptoms of PGD.</p>



<p>Study of this condition is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to establish its prevalence, factors associated with Covid that may be making it more prevalent — such as fear or disrupted mourning practices — and how it may vary between cultures. But, given the potentially high prevalence of PGD brought on by the pandemic, combined with the sheer number of people requiring support from bereavement services, continued attention should be paid to this sector.</p>



<p><strong>Towards the future</strong><br>Though it’s still too early to assess the quality of recent months’ research as a whole, several different psychological topics that still require urgent insights, such as the above, are emerging. This small list is by no means exhaustive; questions remain about Covid’s long term impacts on both physical and mental health, and it’s likely that new issues will come to light in the coming years.</p>



<p>The pandemic has shifted the ways in which we collaborate, and thoroughly tested the processes guarding the gates to publication. Efforts of the research community over the last two years of the pandemic have been incredible, and have helped us get our feet on the ground. From here, it’s unclear how quickly we’ll need to move in order to keep pace with Covid developments. However, it’s likely that the lessons we’ve learned in how to organise effectively and research as quickly as possible will help us return to some sort of normality when it comes to Covid research in the near future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-choose">How to choose a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been a little over six months since I got my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and a phone call from my state health department over the weekend reminded me that I am eligible for a booster. But do I really need to get a third COVID-19 shot? If so, which of the three authorized or approved vaccines available in the United States should I get? To make my decision, I looked at the evidence and talked to some experts. What I found out could be useful to anyone deciding on a booster.</p>



<p>Let’s start with Johnson &amp; Johnson. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">Everyone who got that shot as their initial vaccine is recommended to get a booster</a>, U.S. health officials and experts say (<em>SN</em>: 10/19/21). That’s because the antibody response from that one-dose vaccine isn’t as high as for the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, and it is waning. “It doesn’t go away entirely,” says Sachin Nagrani, medical director of Heal, a company that provides primary health care in people’s homes via telehealth visits and house calls. But a few months after the J&amp;J shot, “it seems like your immune response is less protective.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are few studies on J&amp;J boosters, but the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">AstraZeneca vaccine</a>, which is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">built on similar technology</a> but not available in the United States, could provide some clues (<em>SN: 11/23/20; SN: 2/27/21</em>). Both vaccines use adenoviruses to deliver DNA instructions for building the coronavirus’s spike protein to cells. Studies show combining AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine with a boost from the Pfizer shot (or sometimes Moderna) was more effective than getting another dose of AstraZeneca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in Sweden, a double dose of AstraZeneca was about 50 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness. But AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer was 67 percent effective and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776221002350?via%3Dihub#!">AstraZeneca boosted with Moderna was 79 effective</a>, researchers reported October 18 in the <em>Lancet Regional Health &#8211; Europe</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A preliminary study that mixed and matched vaccines in the United States found that people who got J&amp;J as their first dose developed much higher levels of antibodies if their second dose was an mRNA vaccine than if it was another jab of J&amp;J. Those data suggest that people who got vaxxed with J&amp;J should consider getting an mRNA booster.</p>



<p>For people like me who got an mRNA vaccine in the first go-around, choosing a booster is a bit more complicated. Boosters are recommended for people 65 and older, but I’m younger than that. People who have a high chance of getting exposed to COVID-19 through their jobs or living situations can also get a booster. But right now I work from home, where just my husband and I live. People with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe disease are also eligible. I do have a couple of health conditions that make me more vulnerable. But how much more benefit would I get from a booster shot than from the two doses I already received?</p>



<p>Much of what we know about mRNA booster shots comes from data collected in Israel, where everyone 12 and older has been eligible for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine since the end of August. People who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine and had no underlying health risks, had a very low chance of developing severe COVID-19 or needing to be admitted to a hospital: Just <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736(21)02249-2">3.1 of every 100,000 healthy people</a> who had gotten two doses of vaccine got severe disease, researchers reported October 29 in the <em>Lancet</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with underlying health risks, that number started to climb. Of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people with one or two health risks, 82 developed severe disease. And with three or more health risks, the rate was 113 of every 100,000 people. Getting a booster dropped the severe disease rate for those with one or two health conditions to 3.2 per 100,000 and cut the rate by a bit more than half — to 51.6 per 100,000 — for those with three or more health conditions. That evidence leads me to think a booster is in order for me.</p>



<p>For young, healthy people the risk equation may be different. Nagrani says it’s OK for people in that situation to wait a while for more data on the vaccine’s longevity before getting a booster. But people 65 and older and those with health conditions or who live in assisted-living facilities should probably get a booster now.</p>



<p>The next question is which shot should I get? It’s now fine to mix and match vaccine doses for booster shots. I could stick with Pfizer, or switch to Moderna or J&amp;J. The first thing I’m considering is: What’s my goal? While I would like to not get infected with COVID-19 at all, that’s maybe not so realistic. None of the COVID-19 vaccines produce “sterilizing immunity,” which protects you from getting infected. But they all provide protection against illness.</p>

<p>At first glance, it looks as if the mRNA vaccines are the way to go, but I’ve been intrigued by discussions in the recent advisory board meetings for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about different types of immunity produced by the vaccines. The mRNA vaccines give gangbuster levels of neutralizing antibodies, which help keep the coronavirus from infecting cells. But adenovirus-based vaccines like J&amp;J’s and AstraZeneca’s seem to be better at revving up long-lasting protection from immune cells called T cells. And some evidence suggests that a combo of an mRNA vaccine with an adenovirus-based vaccine like J&amp;J’s could have some advantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a study in France, participants got either two doses of the Pfizer vaccine or a dose of AstraZeneca with a Pfizer chaser. People who got <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04120-y">Pfizer for both doses were twice as likely to get infected </a>with the coronavirus as those who got the mixed doses, researchers reported October 21 in <em>Nature</em>. That was 10 infections among the 2,512 (0.39 percent) who got the mixed doses, compared with 81 infections among the 10,609 people (0.76 percent) who got Pfizer alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I asked one of that study’s coauthors, Jacqueline Marvel, an immunologist at the International Center for Infectious Disease Research (CIRI) in Lyon, France, about whether I should switch to J&amp;J for my booster shot to give my T cells a lift or stick with an mRNA vaccine. “I’m not sure you want to change the vaccine just for increasing the T cell response,” she said. That answer surprised me a little because Marvel studies T cells for a living.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m pro T cell,” she said. But “neutralizing antibodies are what you want to have first. The antibodies stop the virus from getting into the cells and protect you much earlier than the T cells would,” Marvel explained. “If people don’t want to be ill and have symptoms, you want the antibodies.” And to maximize antibodies, the mRNA vaccines are the way to go.</p>



<p>Side effects from the booster doses are similar to those experienced from earlier doses, though some data suggest the effects after a booster may be milder than after the second dose. Some people are worried about rare side effects such as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, that has sometimes happened after an mRNA dose, particularly for young males after the second dose. But that side effect is uncommon: Just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">17 out of 2.5 million people who got a Pfizer booster shot in Israel developed myocarditis</a> or pericarditis, Israeli health officials reported (<em>SN</em>: 10/19/21). I’m not a young man and my first two doses produced only a sore arm, so side effects aren’t a big concern for me.</p>



<p>All of this convinced me to get an mRNA shot. But which one? That decision came down to convenience. I got online and searched for places where I could get my booster. It turns out that few of the grocery stores, pharmacies or other vaccine providers in my area offer the Moderna vaccine (even fewer have the J&amp;J shot), but Pfizer doses are plentiful. So I got a Pfizer booster in my right arm and a flu vaccine in the left. (It’s safe to take both at the same time.) According to the CDC, I’m not alone. Almost <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total">99 percent of people fully vaccinated with Pfizer also chose Pfizer for their booster</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My arms might ache for a little while, but that’s a price I’m more than willing to pay to avoid severe illness for myself and to help protect those around me from getting infected.</p>

                <p>Global temperatures are rising and so, it seems, is part of the sky.</p>



<p>Atmosphere readings collected by weather balloons in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 40 years reveal that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi8065?_ga=2.49013606.1705142086.1635777718-1312948397.1634132513">climate change is pushing the upper boundary of the troposphere</a> — the slice of sky closest to the ground — steadily upward at a rate of 50 to 60 meters per decade, researchers report November 5 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Temperature is the driving force behind this change, says Jane Liu, an environmental scientist at the University of Toronto. The troposphere varies in height around the world, reaching as high as 20 kilometers in the tropics and as low as seven kilometers near the poles. During the year, the upper boundary of the troposphere — called the tropopause — naturally rises and falls with the seasons as air expands in the heat and contracts in the cold. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">as greenhouse gases trap more and more heat in the atmosphere</a>, the troposphere is expanding higher into the atmosphere (<em>SN: 10/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>Liu and her colleagues found that the tropopause rose an average of about 200 meters in height from 1980 to 2020. Nearly all weather occurs in the troposphere, but it’s unlikely that this shift will have on a big effect on weather, the researchers say. Still, this research is an important reminder of the impact of climate change on our world, Liu says.</p>



<p>“We see signs of global warming around us, in retreating glaciers and rising sea levels,” she says. “Now, we see it in the height of the troposphere.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Meat consumption has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/08/cuts-uk-meat-consumption-doubled-health-researchers-food">decreased by 17%</a> in the UK over the past decade, with more and more people questioning the health, environmental and moral implications of eating meat. While some will be unrepentant about their taste for meat, others may find it more morally ambiguous, with big questions about how justifiable their diets really are.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211041536">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, takes a closer look at how meat-eaters grapple with these quandaries. It finds that blaming third parties, holding them responsible for moral transgressions, can reduce the cognitive dissonance involved in eating meat.</p>



<span id="more-44412"></span>



<p>In the first study, 310 American meat-eating participants were randomly assigned to read a newspaper article depicting the animal abuse prevalent in factory farming. The article described the lack of space, lack of fresh air, deprivation of natural behaviours and slaughter that occurs in factory farming. In one condition, participants read that the factory farms were based in the US, while in the other that the farms were in China.</p>



<p>After finishing the article, half of the participants in each group were able to express moral outrage at the factory farm owners and operators by agreeing or disagreeing with statements such as “knowing that animals are helpless against factory farming companies makes me angry on their behalf”. They then reported how guilty they felt about the treatment of these animals, and rated their own moral character, relative to other people, on a scale from one to five. The other half of participants proceeded to these measures without articulating any outrage.</p>



<p>For those who did not have the opportunity to express moral outrage, guilt was higher and ratings of their own moral character were lower when they read that their “in-group” — i.e. other Americans — were responsible for the factory farms. But for those who <em>did</em> express moral outrage, there was no difference in guilt or perceived moral standing whether they had read about American or Chinese factory farms, suggesting that blaming others can decrease feelings of responsibility and moral culpability. A second study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In a third and final study, the team investigated whether highlighting the harms associated with eating meat would also encourage meat-eaters to express outrage towards other, unrelated acts of animal abuse. A total of 300 participants were once again assigned to one of two conditions. In order to provoke feelings of defensiveness around eating meat, those in the &#8220;meat threat&#8221; condition read an article detailing the harms meat eating inflicts on both the environment and the global poor. Those in the other condition did not read an article at this point.</p>



<p>Next, all participants read an article describing the abuse of dolphins in SeaWorld as well as viewing pictures of the abuse. Half of the participants were then asked to briefly describe something about themselves that made them feel like a good person, while the other half described their preference between Mac and Dell computers. Finally, participants reported their moral outrage towards SeaWorld.</p>



<p>Among those participants who had read the article provoking defensiveness, moral outrage towards SeaWorld was much lower if they subsequently affirmed themselves as a good person than if they did not complete the affirmation task. For those who hadn’t read the initial article, affirmation had no impact on expressed moral outrage.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that expressing outrage at factory farming or other animal abuses acts as a way to repair moral self-image. This could assuage people’s guilt about eating meat — but if guilt is mitigated in such a way, people may feel “even more emboldened to consume meat”, the authors suggest.</p>



<p>The team suggests that future research could focus on campaigns designed to “delegitimize the belief that voicing displeasure at one injustice grants moral capital to participate in others”.

<p><strong>Learning and memory transfer: More experimental evidence </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/learning-and-memory-transfer-more-experimental-evidence"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 6, 1971</p>



<p>The first memory molecule has been isolated, characterized and synthesized … [from the brains of] rats that had been shocked in the dark…. It is a protein and dubbed “scotophobin,” after the Greek words for “fear of the dark.” [One researcher] has injected synthetic rat scotophobin into the brains of hundreds of goldfish. While the fish indeed exhibited fear of the dark and resisted learning to swim into the dark, the fear was of brief duration.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The idea that scotophobin stores memories and can be used to transfer them between organisms was met with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11730861_Georges_Ungar_and_memory_transfer">intense skepticism</a> and was eventually discredited by neuroscientists. But the search for a physical basis of memory continues. Over the last few decades, other memory molecule candidates have popped up, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enzyme-revives-long-term-memories">a protein called PKM-zeta</a>, which may help with memory retrieval, and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-injected-one-sea-slug-another-may-transfer-memories">RNA</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 9</em>). Still, the dominant theory is that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memory-brain-engram-neuroscience">memories are stored in synapses</a>, connections between nerve cells in the brain (<em>SN: 2/3/18, p. 22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-nervous-system-brain-cells-digest-feed">Brainless sponges contain early echoes of a nervous system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brains are like sponges, slurping up new information. But sponges may also be a little bit like brains.</p>



<p>Sponges, which are humans’ very distant evolutionary relatives, don’t have nervous systems. But a detailed analysis of sponge cells turns up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abj2949">what might just be an echo of our own brains</a>: cells called neuroids that crawl around the animal’s digestive chambers and send out messages, researchers report in the Nov. 5 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding not only gives clues about the early evolution of more complicated nervous systems, but also raises many questions, says evolutionary biologist Thibaut Brunet of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is just the beginning,” he says. “There’s a lot more to explore.”</p>



<p>The cells were lurking in <em>S</em><em>pongilla lacustris</em>, a freshwater sponge that grows in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. “We jokingly call it the Godzilla of sponges” because of the rhyme with <em>Spongilla</em>, say Jacob Musser, an evolutionary biologist in Detlev Arendt’s group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>



<p>Simple as they are, these sponges have a surprising amount of complexity, says Musser, who helped pry the sponges off a metal ferry dock using paint scrapers. “They’re such fascinating creatures.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="711" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2.jpg" alt="image of a green and yellow Spongilla lacustris on the ocean floor" class="wp-image-3105496" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2-555x383.jpg 555w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2-652x450.jpg 652w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2-269x186.jpg 269w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2-768x530.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-2-840x580.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105496">Cells found lurking in <em>S</em><em>pongilla lacustris </em>(shown), a freshwater sponge that grows in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, could offer clues to how nervous systems evolved.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105496">Kirt L.

<p>With sponges procured, Arendt, Musser and colleagues looked for genes active in individual sponge cells, ultimately arriving at a list of 18 distinct kinds of cells, some known and some unknown. Some of these cells used genes that are essential to more evolutionarily sophisticated nerve cells in other organisms for sending or receiving messages in the form of small blobs of cellular material called vesicles.</p>



<p>One such cell, called a neuroid, caught the scientists’ attention. After seeing that this cell was using those genes involved in nerve cell signaling, the researchers took a closer look. A view through a confocal microscope turned up an unexpected locale for the cells, Musser says. “We realized, ‘My God, they’re in the digestive chambers.’”</p>



<p>Large, circular digestive structures called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/possible-ancestor-sponges-found">choanocyte chambers</a> help move water and nutrients through sponges’ canals, in part by the beating of hairlike cilia appendages (<em>SN: 3/9/15</em>). Neuroids were hovering around some of these cilia, the researchers found, and some of the cilia near neuroids were bent at angles that suggested that they were no longer moving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="423" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg" alt="a purple neuroid cell next to an aqua digestive cell" class="wp-image-3105495" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-680x359.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-330x174.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-768x406.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105495">A neuroid cell (colored purple in this electron micrograph image) gets close to a digestive cell (aqua) in a sponge’s feeding chamber.

<p>The team suspects that these neuroids were sending signals to the cells charged with keeping the sponge fed, perhaps using vesicles to stop the movement of usually undulating cilia. If so, that would be a sophisticated level of control for an animal without a nervous system.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that sponges are using bits and bobs of communications systems that ultimately came together to work as brains of other animals. Understanding the details might provide clues to how nervous systems evolved. “What did animals have, before they had a nervous system?” Musser asks. “There aren’t many organisms that can tell us that. Sponges are one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-science-next-10-years-decadal-survey">Here’s what the next 10 years of space science could look like</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey is basically a sneak preview of the next 10 years of U.S. space science. Every decade, experts assembled by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine collect input from astronomers nationwide to recommend a prioritized list of projects to policy makers and federal agencies. Past to-do lists have been topped by specific big-ticket items, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/celestial-wish-list">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: </em><em>10/6/21; SN: 8/13/10</em>). But this year, astronomers are shaking things up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/26141">latest decadal survey</a>, which charts the course for U.S. astronomy and astrophysics from 2022 to 2032, recommends that NASA create a new program to develop several major space telescopes at a time. Investing early in multiple mission concepts could curb the risk of individual missions becoming too unwieldy and expensive, according to the report released November 4.</p>



<p>“These are super important recommendations,” says Scott Gaudi, an astronomer at the Ohio State University who wasn’t on the National Academies committee that compiled the report. “They really focus the direction of astronomy in the United States — and sort of by extension the rest of the world, because we have lots of international partnerships.”</p>



<p>The proposed multi-mission program would reshape how major space missions are planned. In the past, “you would pick a priority, you’d build it, you’d launch it, and then you would think about what the next priority was,” says Jonathan Fortney, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a member of the survey committee.</p>





<p>But space telescopes are getting more ambitious, complex and expensive, Fortney says. The one-at-a-time model doesn’t work so well when a single mission can take decades from blueprint to blastoff.</p>



<p>Having several big projects in the works offers a bit of insurance. If researchers work on one mission for a few years and realize that the technology isn’t there to make it fly on time, NASA could switch gears and send another telescope to space first, Fortney says. Developing multiple missions in parallel could also shrink the long wait time between launches.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited by that. It’s like the best possible outcome,” Gaudi says. This setup could boost confidence that big space missions can stay on budget and on schedule, he adds, after the large cost overruns and delays that have mired the long-awaited James Webb Space Telescope. “It is a really new way of approaching things, and one that’s really needed to advance astronomy into the next few decades.”</p>



<p>The first mission in the new program, according to the survey report, should be a space telescope that views the universe in infrared, optical and ultraviolet wavelengths, filling a gap left by other instruments. The Hubble Space Telescope mainly looks at optical and ultraviolet light, while the James Webb telescope will primarily see the universe in infrared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg" alt="illustration of the James Webb Space Telescope" class="wp-image-3105486" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg 714w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-608x383.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-295x186.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-920x580.jpg 920w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105486">Astronomers’ top-ranked priority in the 2001 decadal survey, the James Webb Space Telescope (illustrated), is finally slated to launch in December.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105486">Northrop Grumman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>With a light-collecting area more than twice as wide as Hubble’s, this newfangled observatory could glimpse planets in other star systems that are a tenth of a billionth as bright as their stars, and could tease out the specific wavelengths of light, or spectra, given off by exoplanets. The telescope could also observe stars, galaxies and other celestial objects. With an estimated price tag of $11 billion, the telescope would be slated to launch in the early 2040s.</p>



<p>Five years after starting work on that first flagship mission, NASA should begin developing both a far-infrared mission and an X-ray mission, each costing an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion, the survey recommends.</p>



<p>A far-infrared window into the universe could help astronomers study how water behaves in forming planetary systems, Fortney says. A successor to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-chandra-x-ray-telescope-celebrates-20-years-space">NASA’s 22-year-old Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> could reveal new details of galaxy evolution, supermassive black hole behavior and other energetic phenomena (<em>SN: 7/25/19</em>).</p>



<p>On the ground, astronomers’ highest priorities, according to the decadal survey, are continuing to build two major optical observatories, the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii — though the latter project has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-mauna-kea-opened-astronomy-controversy">faced controversy</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>).</p>



<p>The survey also notes that it is time to replace the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the Very Long Baseline Array of telescope dishes scattered across the United States. The proposed successor to these world-class radio observatories is the Next-Generation Very Large Array, which would be 10 times as sensitive.</p>



<p>Fortney is optimistic that NASA and other federal agencies will make the decadal survey’s top-ranked priorities a reality. “The record has been quite good, in terms of the most prominent recommendations being born out,” he says. “I have really high confidence that these things really will happen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">Massive Study Finds No Link Between Time Spent Playing Video Games And Wellbeing</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Video games are perhaps one of the most politicised forms of entertainment media out there. In the decades since they were first created, governments, politicians, health bodies and beyond have voiced concerns that the amount of time some players spend in these virtual worlds could be detrimental to their mental health.</p>



<p>Despite all this concern, there’s been a lack of high-quality research into the effect of video games on player wellbeing. To remedy this situation, Matti Vuorre and colleagues at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with several large game publishers such as Nintendo and Square Enix, conducted an ambitious longitudinal study. These fears, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8cxyh">they conclude in their recent preprint</a> on <em>PsyArXiv</em>, are unfounded.</p>



<span id="more-44390"></span>



<p>In order to investigate whether longer play times had an impact on player wellbeing, the team recruited a massive 38,935 players of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Apex Legends, Eve Online, Forza, Gran Turismo, Outriders</em>, and <em>The Crew 2</em>. Recruitment emails for this study targeted specifically English-speaking players from several countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of six weeks, players were asked to answer three &#8220;waves&#8221; of a survey, sent two weeks apart, containing measures of wellbeing and motivation. The first measure of wellbeing, a 13-point scale of positive and negative experiences (SPANE), asked participants how they had been feeling in the previous two weeks, and to rate how often they had experienced six positive and six negative feelings. The Cantril self-anchoring scale, in which participants rate their level of life satisfaction between 0 to 10, was also used to assess wellbeing.</p>



<p>Players were also asked to reflect on their experiences playing the game over the past two weeks, by filling in the player experience and need satisfaction scale (PENS), which included questions on feelings of autonomy, competence, relatedness (for example, with other players), as well as motivation. Finally, participants were asked to give an estimate of the time they’d spent playing the video game they were recruited through for the previous two weeks (the games’ publishers also provided the research team with each participant’s actual total playtimes for these two weeks).</p>



<p>Analyses looked at the relationship between hours played in one wave and wellbeing scores in the subsequent wave. Sifting through the data like this revealed that time spent playing these games had little to no apparent causal effect on wellbeing or life satisfaction. The effect was so small, the authors say, that if players went from their minimum play time to their maximum play time, their wellbeing scores would only shift by around 0.013 points on the SPANE scale. The impact on life satisfaction scores would be similarly tiny, shifting by just 0.02 points. These kinds of numbers are not indicative of any meaningful impact on wellbeing.</p>



<p>Switching these two factors around to look at the effect of feelings and life satisfaction on play time, the team found that a one-point increase on the SPANE scale of wellbeing would lead to a 0.01 hour per week increase in play time. Similarly, life satisfaction had essentially no impact on duration of play, suggesting that there is no causal relationship between wellbeing and time spent gaming.</p>



<p>In contrast, however, motivation to game was causally linked to wellbeing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when players wanted to engage with video games, they got a subsequent boost in feelings of wellbeing, whereas when they felt like they were playing through compulsion, those feelings dropped.</p>



<p>The span of game genres used in this study is rather wide — <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, for example, is a pastoral experience, which differs significantly from the high commitment, often high-pressure experience of <em>Eve Online</em>. Even so, there are many other genres which also merit investigation. Time spent playing mobile games, as well as those with microtransactions or addictive elements, may have different impacts on player wellbeing.</p>



<p>Sampling in this study, the authors say, may also have somewhat limited the validity of this result. Because participants were recruited through self-selection, people with particular traits or dispositions that made them more likely to be unaffected by lengthy gaming sessions may have been more likely to provide data. The age of participants — on average, 34 years old — may also limit the generalisability of these findings. It’s possible that as adults, these gamers have developed gaming habits that specifically do not affect their wellbeing, which may not be the case for younger players. And of course, these players were all English speakers, so it remains unclear whether there may be cultural differences in the strength of the relationship between gaming and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Despite these limitations, the results of this study stand as much needed preliminary evidence that time spent playing video games is not a threat to wellbeing. In the future, similarly robust research to confirm these findings in other age groups, as well as investigating the impact of specific gameplay features, will help push this research area forward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-child-skull-hominid-cave-discovery">A child’s partial skull adds to the mystery of how Homo naledi treated the dead</a></h4>

              
                <p>A child’s partial skull found in a remote section of a South African cave system has fueled suspicion that an ancient hominid known as <em>Homo naledi</em> deliberately disposed of its dead in caves.</p>



<p>An international team led by paleoanthropologist Lee Berger of University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg pieced together 28 skull fragments and six teeth from a child’s skull discovered in a narrow opening located about 12 meters from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-new-species-human-genus">an underground chamber where cave explorers first found <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/15</em>). Features of the child’s skull qualify it as <em>H. naledi</em>, a species with an orange-sized brain and skeletal characteristics of both present-day people and <em>Homo</em> species from around 2 million years ago.</p>



<p>“The case is building for deliberate, ritualized body disposal in caves by <em>Homo naledi</em>,” Berger said at a November 4 news conference held in Johannesburg. While <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pieces-homo-naledi-story-continue-puzzle">that argument is controversial</a>, there is no evidence that the child’s skull was washed into the tiny space or dragged there by predators or scavengers (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Berger’s group describes the find in two papers published November 4 in <em>PaleoAnthropology. </em>In one, Juliet Brophy, a paleoanthropologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and colleagues <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/64">describe the youngster&#8217;s skull</a>. In the other, paleoanthropologist Marina Elliott of Canada’s Simon Fraser University in Burnaby and colleagues detail <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/68">new explorations in South Africa’s Rising Star cave system</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers nicknamed the new find Leti, short for a word in a local South African language that means “the lost one.” Leti likely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans">dates to the same time as other <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a>, between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>). Berger’s team suspects Leti died at about age 4 to 6 years based on the rate at which children grow today. But that’s a rough approximation as the scientists can’t yet say how fast <em>H. naledi</em> kids grew.</p>

<html><body><p>PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, November 4.</p>



<p>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that it is the first wholly Open Access (OA) publisher to deliver Release 5 COUNTER-compliant usage reporting to the library community. This is an important milestone in the development of usage reporting that meets the growing needs of the OA movement.</p>



<p>PLOS and LibLynx announced a partnership in 2020 to develop ground-breaking analytics that communicate the usage and impact of OA content to their stakeholder communities, and libraries in particular.&nbsp; The first phase of this initiative was to deliver COUNTER reports <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">to PLOS institutional partners</a> that enable them to understand their usage of PLOS OA content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a huge milestone for us. The development of next generation metrics for wholly-OA content is one of great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions, and we are delivering on that promise,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS.</p>



<p>&ldquo;COUNTER very much welcomes PLOS becoming a publisher compliant with the Code of Practice. Our consultations with the library community, our OA Advisory Group and ongoing workshops demonstrate a demand for COUNTER reports from fully OA publishers, as part of the evaluation of the return on investment associated with open access content,&rdquo; said Lorraine Estelle, Project Director, COUNTER.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We needed to develop custom processing logic that attributed OA usage to organizations based on their registered IP addresses in order to generate COUNTER reports for PLOS&rsquo; library community,&rdquo; said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having engaged with the community over the last year to better understand their reporting needs, PLOS and LibLynx are now working on the development of new, more flexible reporting tools to better understand usage and impact of OA content.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baleen-whales-eat-poop-more-food-ecosystem">Baleen whales eat (and poop) a lot more than we realized</a></h4>

              
                <p>Whalers have plucked giant whales from the sea for much of the last century, reducing their numbers by up to 99 percent for certain species. Some scientists thought that krill — the tiny crustaceans that many whales eat in gargantuan gulps — would explode in number as a result, mostly free from the feeding pressure of the largest animals that have ever lived.</p>



<p>But that didn’t happen. Instead, Antarctic krill numbers have dwindled since the mid-20th century, by more than 80 percent in areas heavily trafficked by whalers. Many other consumers of krill, like seabirds and fish, have suffered too in the absence of the crustaceans and their giant eaters.</p>



<p>Now, scientists have a clearer idea why this happened: whale poop, or rather, the lack of it.</p>



<p>A new study finds that baleen whales, including blue and humpback whales, eat on average <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03991-5">three times as much krill</a> and other food as previously thought, and more food in means more poop out. Paradoxically, the collapse of the krill may stem from fewer whales excreting iron-rich, digested krill, denying these ecosystems some crucial nutrients they need to thrive. Phytoplankton blooms, which sustain krill and many other parts of the food web, rely on that iron. Restoring whale populations to prewhaling levels could help bolster these ecosystems and even store more carbon in the ocean, researchers report in the Nov. 4 <em>Nature.</em></p>





<p>“It’s hard to know what role whales play in ecosystems without knowing how much they’re eating,” says Joe Roman, a marine ecologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington who wasn’t involved in the research. Whale food intake was coarsely understood before, he says, and this study will “allow us to better understand how the widespread depletion of whales has impacted ocean ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Assessing the precise diet of Boeing 737–sized creatures that gulp down hordes of centimeter-long invertebrates far below the surface of the ocean is not a trivial undertaking. Previous estimates relied on dissections of dead whales or inferring whales’ metabolic needs based on their size. “These studies were educated guesses, and none were conducted on live whales in the wild,” says Matthew Savoca, a marine biologist at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, Calif.</p>



<p>But new technology gave Savoca and colleagues “a chance to answer a really basic biological question about some of the most charismatic animals on earth.”</p>



<p>The researchers needed to know three things: how often whales feed, how big of gulps they take and how much food is in each gulp. Using sophisticated sensors suction-cupped to the backs of 321 individuals of seven whale species, the researchers could tell when the whales lunged for prey, a reliable sign of feeding. Aerial drones snapped photos of 105 whales, which the researchers used to estimate gulp size. Finally, sonar mapping revealed the density of krill in key feeding areas.</p>

<p>Combining these datasets together revealed a more detailed look at feeding than ever before, says Sarah Fortune, a marine ecologist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Winnipeg. Savoca and his colleagues “measured all the things you need to measure to get an accurate estimate of consumption,” for baleen whales, she says.</p>



<p>It turns out that, on average, baleen whales eat about three times as much food as earlier estimates suggested. For example, a blue whale can put down 16 metric tons of krill in a day, the researchers found. Energetically, that’s equivalent to around 10 million to 20 million calories, or about 30,000 Big Macs, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whales aren’t eating that much every day. The animals go for months without a bite when migrating vast distances. But the sheer volume of food that they consume, and then excrete, suggests that whales shape ocean ecosystems to a larger degree than previously thought, Savoca says, making their loss that much more impactful.</p>



<p>That’s because one role whales play is that of nutrient cycler. By feeding on iron-rich krill in the deep and returning some of that iron to the surface in the form of poop, whales help keep this crucial element in the food web. Excessive whaling might have broken this iron cycle. With less iron at the surface, phytoplankton blooms shrink, krill numbers crash and the ecosystem becomes less productive, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before industrial whaling <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-us-commercial-whaling-was-coming-to-an-end">killed millions of whales</a> in the 20th century, the researchers estimate that baleen whales in just the Southern Ocean alone, a key feeding area, consumed 430 million metric tons of krill each year, more than twice the biomass of all krill that’s found in those waters today (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>).&nbsp;Even with today’s diminished populations, researchers estimate that whales prevent approximately 1,200 metric tons of iron from being lost each year, left to drift down to the dark deep of the Southern Ocean.</p>



<p>Whales are likely not the only factor behind the staggering loss of krill, Savoca says, but the evidence suggests that “whales play a role here, and when you wholesale remove them, the system becomes, on average, less productive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">Some whale populations are rebounding</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>). If whales and krill could be brought back to their early 1900s numbers, the productivity of the Southern Ocean could be boosted by 11 percent, the researchers calculate. That increased productivity would translate into more carbon-rich bodies, from krill to blue whales, which together would store 215 million metric tons of carbon annually, the equivalent of taking more than <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">170 million cars</a> off the road for a year, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“Whales are not the solution to climate change,” Savoca says. “But rebuilding whale populations would help a sliver, and we need lots of slivers put together to solve the problem.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gold-heavy-elements-cosmos">Neutron star collisions probably make more gold than other cosmic smashups</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cosmic origins of elements heavier than iron are mysterious. One elemental birthplace came to light in 2017 when two neutron-rich dead stars collided and spewed out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">gold, platinum and other</a> hefty elements (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). A few years later, a smashup of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">another neutron star</a> and a black hole left scientists wondering which type of cosmic clash was the more prolific element foundry (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, they have an answer. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac26c6">Collisions of two neutron stars</a> probably take the cake, scientists report October 25 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>To create heavy elements after either type of collision, neutron star material must be flung into space, where a series of nuclear reactions called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dwarf-galaxy-was-heavy-element-factory">r-process</a> can transform the material (<em>SN: 4/22/16</em>).</p>



<p>How much material escapes into space, if any, depends on various factors. For example, in collisions of a neutron star and black hole, the black hole has to be relatively small, or “there’s no hope at all,” says astrophysicist Hsin-Yu Chen of MIT. “It’s going to swallow the neutron star right away,” without ejecting anything.</p>



<p>Questions remain about both types of collisions, spotted via the ripples in spacetime that they kick up. So Chen and colleagues considered a range of possibilities for the properties of neutron stars and black holes, such as the distributions of their masses and how fast they spin. The team then calculated the mass ejected by each type of collision under those varied conditions. In most scenarios, the neutron star–black hole mergers made a smaller quantity of heavy elements than the neutron star duos — in one case only about a hundredth the amount.</p>



<p>Still, the ultimate element factory ranking remains up in the air. The scientists compared just these two types of collisions, not other possible sources of heavy elements such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-explosion-hypernova-supernova-universe-heavy-elements-origin">exploding stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Self-control — or lack of it — can have a serious impact on our lives. Poor self-control can lead to feelings of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/02/poor-self-control-can-lead-to-feelings-of-loneliness/">loneliness</a>, while those with higher levels of self-discipline <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/06/people-with-strong-self-control-experience-less-intense-bodily-states-like-hunger-and-fatigue/">experience</a> states like hunger and tiredness less intensely. Yet despite these obvious benefits, the vast majority of us sometimes experience failures in self-control no matter how hard we try.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/35/e2018726118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, looks to quantify the cost of self-control. Candace M. Raio and Paul W. Glimcher from the New York University School of Medicine find that we’re willing to pay a monetary price to avoid having to exert self-control — and we’ll pay more if the temptation is particularly strong.</p>



<span id="more-44298"></span>



<p>In the first study, conducted in a lab, dieting participants started by indicating how healthy, tasty and tempting they found particular foods like crisps or chocolate brownies. They then reported how much of a $10 endowment they would be willing to pay to avoid having the highly tempting food placed immediately in front of them for half an hour. The tempting food was then placed in front of them, and the participant was given further opportunities to bid to have it replaced with a less tempting food.</p>



<p>Importantly, there was a small chance that each bid would go to auction, where it was compared against a random figure between $0 and $10: if the participants bid a higher amount, they would  have a low-tempting food placed in front of them for the remainder of the 30 minutes, but if they bid a lower amount, the highly tempting food would remain for the rest of the time.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants were prepared to pay on average 15% of the $10 to remove the temptation — and continued to bid a similar amount throughout the task, suggesting a sustained desire to have temptation removed. In total, 22% of participants consumed the highly tempting food.</p>



<p>The second study replicated the first — only this time, participants were told they would also lose a $15 bonus if they ate the tempting food. Again, the dieting participants showed a sustained willingness to pay to avoid temptation, bidding on average $2.85 out of their $10 endowment to have the food removed. Thus, they spent more money when the costs of not meeting their self-control goals were higher. Interestingly, with this penalty in place none of the participants presented with the highly tempting food consumed it.</p>



<p>In a third study, some participants were exposed to stress before the self-control task through the immersion of their hand into ice-cold water. These stressed participants were willing to pay more to avoid the tempting food compared to non-stressed participants, more than doubling the amount of money they put up. And in a final study, the team found that participants were willing to pay more to avoid highly tempting food versus food that was only a little tempting.</p>



<p>So, overall, dieting participants were willing to pay actual money in order to avoid exercising self-control in the face of temptation. This reinforces previous research that suggests that when faced with temptation we will attempt to avoid using cognitive resources like self-control as much as we possibly can, relying on different tactics instead. The results also suggest that we carefully weigh up the costs of exercising self-control and the costs of losing self-control, making active and rational decisions about when to give into temptation and what to sacrifice when doing so.</p>



<p>The study also offers interesting insights into &#8220;precommitment&#8221; — rather than being forced to face temptation and succeed, participants preferred to not be exposed to the risk of failure at all. This could be a useful strategy when trying to achieve goals (and is probably already well known to many dieters who remove snacks from their house rather than trying not to eat them).</p>



<p>Future research could look at what happens when people have to face temptation over an unknown time period: all participants in this particular study knew the maximum amount of time they would have to resist temptation, but something different may have happened if they had not had this information. Looking at non-financial costs people are willing to pay could also be enlightening, going some way to explain why we manage to resist temptation in some cases but not in others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-dark-side-image-atmosphere-ice-frost-charon">Pluto’s dark side reveals clues to its atmosphere and frost cycles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pluto’s dark side has come into dim view, thanks to the light of the dwarf planet’s moon.</p>



<p>When NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mission-pluto-live-coverage">flew past Pluto in 2015</a>, almost all the images of the dwarf planet’s unexpectedly complex surface were of the side illuminated by the sun (<em>SN: 7/15/15</em>). Darkness shrouded the dwarf planet’s other hemisphere. Some of it, like the area near the south pole, hadn’t seen the sun for decades.</p>



<p>Now, mission scientists have finally released a grainy <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac2743">view of the dwarf planet’s dark side</a>. The researchers describe the process to take the photo and what it tells them about how Pluto’s nitrogen cycle affects its atmosphere October 20 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Before New Horizons passed by Pluto, the team suspected the dwarf planet’s largest moon, Charon, might reflect enough light to illuminate the distant world’s surface. So the researchers had the spacecraft turn back toward the sun to take a parting peek at Pluto.</p>

<p>At first, the images just showed a ring of sunlight filtering through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-flows-haze-offer-more-clues-plutos-geology">Pluto’s hazy atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/15</em>). “It’s very hard to see anything in that glare,” says planetary scientist John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “It’s like trying to read a street sign when you’re driving toward the setting sun and you have a dirty windshield.”</p>



<p>Spencer and colleagues took a few steps to make it possible to pull details of Pluto’s dark side out of the glare. First, the team had the spacecraft take 360 short snapshots of the backlit dwarf planet. Each was about 0.4 seconds long, to avoid overexposing the images. The team also took snapshots of the sun without Pluto in the frame so that the sun could be subtracted out after the fact.</p>





<p>Tod Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., tried to process the images when he got the data in 2016. At the time, the rest of the data from New Horizons was still fresh and took up most of his attention, so he didn’t have the time to tackle such a tricky project.</p>



<p>But “it was something that just sat there and ate away at me,” Lauer says. He tried again in 2019. Because the spacecraft was moving as it took the images, each image was a little bit smeared or blurred. Lauer wrote a computer code to remove that blur from each individual frame. Then he added the reflected Charon light in each of those hundreds of images together to produce a single image.</p>





<p>“When Tod did that painstaking analysis, we finally saw something emerging in the dark there … giving us a little bit of a glimpse of what the dark pole of Pluto looks like,” Spencer says.</p>



<p>That the team got anything at all is impressive, says planetary scientist Carly Howett, also of the Southwest Research Institute and who is on the New Horizons team but was not involved in this work. “This dataset is really, really hard to work with,” she says. “Kudos to this team. I wouldn’t have wanted to do this.”</p>



<p>The image, Howett says, can help scientists understand how Pluto’s frigid nitrogen atmosphere varies with its decades-long seasons. Pluto’s atmosphere is controlled by how much nitrogen is in a gas phase in the air and how much is frozen on the surface. The more nitrogen ice that evaporates, the thicker the atmosphere becomes. If too much nitrogen freezes to the ground, the atmosphere could collapse altogether.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2.jpg" alt="image of pluto showing different kinds of ices represented by different colors" class="wp-image-3105398" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105398">In this image of Pluto’s sunlit side from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, different colors represent different kinds of ices. A faint glimpse of Pluto’s dark hemisphere in newly released mission images reveals some new details about how those ices behave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105398">SwRI, JHUAPL, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When New Horizons was there, Pluto’s south pole looked darker than the north pole. That suggests there was not a lot of fresh nitrogen frost freezing out of the atmosphere there, even though it was nearing winter. “The previous summer ended decades ago, but Pluto cools off pretty slowly,” Spencer says. “Maybe it’s still so warm [that] the frost can’t condense there, and that keeps the atmosphere from collapsing.”</p>



<p>There was a bright spot in the middle of the image, which could be a fresh ice deposit. That’s also not surprising, Howett says. The ices may still be moving from the north pole to the south pole as Pluto moves deeper into its wintertime.</p>



<p>“We’ve thought this for a long time. It makes sense,” she says. “But it’s nice to see it happening.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why depth interviewing is essential to understanding individuals and institutions</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/why-depth-interviewing-is-essential-to-understanding-individuals-and-institutions/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/christina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>From scraping &#8220;big data&#8221; from the internet to the analyzing genomic information about individuals and social groups, today’s researchers have a dizzying array of new methods for studying the social world. One consequence of this explosion of options has been to obscure the value of tried-and-true ones. Depth interviewing is a case in point. Once assumed to be a core research tool, many of today’s researchers have cast a skeptical eye on it. While past debates centered around whether we could rely on insights drawn from a limited number of people, new concerns have arisen from those who advocate direct observation, whether in natural or experimental settings. These skeptics express doubt that social researchers can trust the information gleaned from self-reports, pointing especially to the ways that depth interviewing may elicit accounts that are internally inconsistent or that contradict what people actually do. Such doubters argue that since people are prone to express ideas, beliefs, or behaviors that contradict one another, their self-reports are neither credible nor useful.<br><br>These critiques reflect a fundamental misunderstanding about what depth interviews can accomplish and how, when designed and carried out well, they are uniquely suited to gathering crucial insights about the nature of human consciousness and the relationship between thought and action. One-on-one interviewing creates a setting in which the “unobservable” becomes visible. Life history interviews allow people to describe and reflect on how prior experiences have led them to their current circumstances and outlooks, including what key events propelled them to devise life strategies and make consequential life choices. Focusing on the present, depth interviews provide a safe space where people are invited to share their most private experiences, thoughts, and feelings. While it is not be possible to observe a wide range of intimate activities, from sexual encounters to all sorts of dyadic interactions, interviews allow participants to describe and reflect on such events. And whatever the topic, interviews allow people to explore the meanings they attach to their actions and beliefs and to reveal the processes by which their social contexts created experiences that prompted ensuing responses.<br><br>Indeed, a key contribution of depth interviewing lies in its ability to uncover the contradictions that people express. Rather than accepting such accounts at face value, our research (and that of many others) demonstrates that we ignore contradictory thoughts and actions at our peril. Contradictory accounts as well as inconsistencies between “saying” and “doing” are central to human thought and action. Depth interviews provide an opportunity to delve into the nature of such beliefs and behaviors and explore the reasons people hold inconsistent views or act in apparently inconsistent ways. In addition to unearthing the meanings people imbue to their contradictory thinking or behavior, interviews can also discover the social contexts that give rise to them. When people express inconsistent beliefs or reveal conflicts between their values and choices, they alert us to look for the social contexts and cultural formations that create conflicts for which there are no simple or straightforward ways to respond. </p><p>Given the complexity of twenty-first-century life, it has become even more crucial to understand how people navigate the tensions created by conflicting institutional arrangements. In the context of a rapidly changing world, interviews shed light on the interplay between incompatible options and the evolving responses people craft to cope with them. Paying close attention to the different layers of meaning within each interview and carefully analyzing the patterns that emerge across all the interviewees enables depth interviewers to understand how social structures and cultural schemas shape human endeavors and how, in turn, social actors participate in constructing and potentially changing the world they inherit. By eliciting contradictory accounts and using them to delve into why people hold inconsistent beliefs or act in contradictory ways, depth interviews illuminate complex social patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>Whether the goal is to chart how structure and action interact as individuals build their life paths, to learn about intimate experiences that cannot be observed, to uncover how people give meaning to their own and others’ practices and beliefs, or to understand how social arrangements prompt people to hold contradictory views and take inconsistent actions, depth interviews are the best, and possibly the only, method for learning about such core social dynamics. When interviewers ask probing questions, listen carefully to their participants’ answers, and analyze their findings with an eye firmly focused on discovering the patterns that emerge from the complex material they gather, interviewing enlightens us about the many dimensions of human experience that cannot be reduced to numbers, biological factors, or observable behavior. As we rightfully seek to expand the social science toolkit, it would be ironic if we lose sight of a method that offers unique access to the hidden dimensions of personal and social life. Instead, we must renew our commitment to a research technique that places human consciousness at the forefront.</p><p><em><sup>Featured image by </sup></em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/eF7HN40WbAQ"><sup><em>Christina@wocintechchat.com</em></sup></a><em><sup> via Unsplash</sup></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/672104152/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f11%2fchristina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/the-arctic-paradox-why-the-arctic-is-caught-in-the-conflicting-pressures-of-global-climate-change/">The Arctic Paradox: why the Arctic is caught in the conflicting pressures of global climate change</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/engineering-a-new-capitalism-for-the-21st-century/">Engineering a new capitalism for the 21st century</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/five-books-on-climate-change-you-need-to-read/">Five books on climate change you need to read</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Brain
Network Dynamics during Working Memory Are Modulated by Dopamine and Diminished
in Schizophrenia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible
working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood.
Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide
switching between activity states using a combination of functional
magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with
schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network
control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1
receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2
receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with
schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a
more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics
during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia
pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">A rush to watch a supernova exposed its last gasp before exploding</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mad scramble to observe the moments after a star’s death is helping scientists understand how the star lived out its last year.</p>



<p>Astronomers reported the exploding star just 18 hours after it flared up on March 31, 2020, in a galaxy about 60 million light-years away from Earth in the Virgo cluster. The supernova occurred in part of the sky already watched by NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/less-year-after-launch-tess-already-finding-bizarre-worlds">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>, which images large portions of the sky every 30 minutes (<em>SN: 1/8/19</em>). And a team of scientists quickly realized that data would track precisely how the eruption brightened over time, making it ideal for further study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn even more, the team leapt into action, viewing the supernova with a variety of telescopes in the hours and days that followed, even orchestrating a last-minute change of plans for the Hubble Space Telescope. That provided the supernova’s spectrum, an accounting of its light broken up by wavelength, at various moments after the blast.</p>



<p>All that data revealed that in the last year of its life, the star had <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab2887/6410679?redirectedFrom=fulltext">spewed some of its outer layers into space</a>, researchers report October 26 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The amount of material ejected was about 0.23 times the mass of the sun, the team estimates.&nbsp;When the supernova went off, it launched a shock wave that plowed through that material shortly after the explosion, generating light picked up by the telescopes.</p>



<p>As large stars get closer to death, they may start behaving erratically. Aging stars fuse heavier and heavier elements in their cores. For this star, the switch to fusing oxygen could have triggered that shedding in its last year, astrophysicist Samaporn Tinyanont of the University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues suggest. “These stars have a roller coaster last few years of their life,” Tinyanont says.</p>



<p>Scientists hope that understanding that roller coaster ride could help them recognize when other stars are about to blow.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/02/frenemies-both-help-and-harm-each-other-at-work/">“Frenemies” Both Help And Harm Each Other At Work</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Think about your relationships with your colleagues… I bet there are at least some who you’d call &#8220;frenemies&#8221;. Maybe there’s a co-worker whose sense of humour you love, say — but who also irritates you by failing to pull their weight. In fact, the workplace is the ideal breeding ground for relationships that are characterised by simultaneous, strong positive <em>and</em> negative feelings — so-called &#8220;ambivalent relationships&#8221; (or frenemies) — note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-88624-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s surprising, then, how little is known about how frenemies behave with each other, write Shimul Melwani at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Naomi Rothman at Lehigh University. So the pair ran a series of studies to find out.</p>



<span id="more-44293"></span>



<p>In the first, groups of 3 -6 students who’d been assigned a joint task were asked 2.5 weeks into the project to rate how positively and/or negatively they felt about each other. About a month later, they all reported on the extent to which they’d received help (support in a discussion, say), or harm (a verbal attack, perhaps), from each other. Unsurprisingly, the students gave more help to team members they liked and enacted more harmful behaviour towards those that they disliked. But the data also showed that frenemies both helped <em>and </em>harmed each other.</p>



<p>In a second study, the researchers used variations of a standard lab technique for developing closeness between two people. While seated in a cubicle by themselves, these participants used instant messaging to communicate with a partner, to share answers to a set of questions. Some followed questions designed to foster a positive relationship — by getting them to discuss their hobbies and interests, for example, and also to share a few things that they liked about their partner. Other pairs followed a &#8220;negative&#8221; question set (this included a final question that asked them to share a few things that they <em>didn’t </em>like about their partner). A third group followed a frenemy set. For example, after answering the question, &#8220;What is one recent accomplishment that you are proud of?&#8221; (a question that can enhance closeness and positive feelings between people), these participants had to compare and evaluate each other’s achievements (encouraging more negative feelings).</p>



<p>Next came what the participants believed was a collaborative task. And there were some interesting findings. Those in the ambivalent condition acted more co-operatively than those in the negative group; they claimed less of a shared reward, for example, and made more helpful contributions to a piece of work that they believed had been completed by their partner. However, they also delivered more harmful feedback about their partner to the experimenter, compared with those in the positive group — but delivered less negative feedback directly to their partner than did those in the negative group.</p>



<p>For their final study, the team turned to actual co-workers: they ran an online study of 166 US-based participants who worked in retail. These people reported on their experiences, emotions and motivations in actual positive, negative and ambivalent relationships with colleagues. For example, they reported on occasions in which they had supported these colleagues, or instigated arguments, acted rudely or started rumours about them.</p>



<p>Echoing the results of the second study, these employees were more likely to &#8220;covertly&#8221; harm frenemies (to spread rumours behind their back say) than people they felt positively about. But they also helped frenemies more than they helped people they didn’t like.</p>



<p>There are implications for workplaces, the researchers conclude. One important one is this: though ambivalent relationships involve high levels of negativity (as well as positivity), “they are much more beneficial compared to negative relationships,” they write. Managers could well struggle to turn negative relationships into positive ones. But if positivity-focused exercises, such as trust-building interactions, could shift relationships characterised by thorough dislike to frenemy status, everyone could benefit. “Even though it is impractical to entirely transform one’s worst relationships into one’s best ones, by infusing some positivity into these relationships, they can become ambivalent, and deliver some benefits at work,” the researchers write.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">Lithium-ion batteries made with recycled materials can outlast newer counterparts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lithium-ion batteries with recycled cathodes can outperform batteries with cathodes made from pristine materials, lasting for thousands of additional charging cycles, a study finds.&nbsp;<br><br>Growing demand for these batteries — which power devices from smartphones to electric vehicles — may outstrip <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the world’s supply of some crucial ingredients</a>, such as cobalt (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>). Ramping up recycling could help avert a potential shortage. But some manufacturers worry that impurities in recycled materials may cause battery performance to falter.</p>



<p>“Based on our study, recycled materials can perform as well as, or even better than, virgin materials,” says materials scientist Yan Wang of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.</p>



<p>Using shredded spent batteries, Wang and colleagues extracted the electrodes and dissolved the metals from those battery bits in an acidic solution. By tweaking the solution’s pH, the team removed impurities such as iron and copper and recovered over 90 percent of three key metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. The recovered metals formed the basis for the team’s cathode material.</p>



<p>In tests of how well batteries maintain their capacity to store energy after repeated use and recharging, batteries with recycled cathodes outperformed ones made with brand-new commercial materials of the same composition. It took 11,600 charging cycles for the batteries with recycled cathodes to lose 30 percent of their initial capacity. That’s <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00433-5">about 50 percent better than the respectable 7,600 cycles</a> for the batteries with new cathodes, the team reports October 15 in <em>Joule</em>. Those thousands of extra cycles could translate into years of better battery performance, Wang says.</p>
