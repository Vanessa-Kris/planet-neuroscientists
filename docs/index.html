              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">Earth will warm 2.7 degrees Celsius based on current pledges to cut emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year was supposed to be a turning point in addressing climate change. But the world’s nations <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021">are failing to meet the moment</a>, states a new report by the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>



<p>The <em>Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On</em>, released October 26, reveals that current pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and rein in global warming still put the world on track to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century.</p>



<p>Aiming for “net-zero emissions” by midcentury — a goal recently announced by China, the United States and other countries, but without clear plans on how to do so — could reduce that warming to 2.2 degrees C. But that still falls short of the mark, U.N. officials stated at a news event for the report’s release.</p>



<p>At a landmark meeting in Paris in 2015, 195 nations pledged to eventually reduce their emissions enough to hold global warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">to well below 2 degrees C</a> by 2100 (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). Restricting global warming further, to just 1.5 degrees C, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">forestall many more devastating consequences</a> of climate change, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, reported in 2018 (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). In its latest report, released in August, the IPCC noted that extreme weather events, exacerbated by human-caused climate change, now occur in every part of the planet — and warned that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the window to reverse some of these effects is closing</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>





<p>Despite these dire warnings, “the parties to the Paris Agreement are utterly failing to keep [its] target in reach,” said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. “The era of half measures and hollow promises must end.”</p>



<p>The new U.N. report comes at a crucial time, just days before world leaders meet for the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. The COP26 meeting — postponed from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic — holds particular significance because it is the first COP meeting since the 2015 agreement in which signatories are expected to significantly ramp up their emissions reductions pledges.</p>



<p>The U.N. Environment Programme has kept annual tabs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">on the still-yawning gap</a> between existing national pledges to reduce emissions and the Paris Agreement target (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). Ahead of the COP26 meeting, 120 countries, responsible for emitting just over half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, announced their new commitments to address climate change by 2030.</p>



<p>The 2021 report finds that new commitments bring the world only slightly closer to where emissions need to be by 2030 to reach warming targets. With the new pledges, total annual emissions in 2030 would be 7.5 percent lower (about 55 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent) than they would have been with pledges as of last year (about 59 gigatons). But to stay on track for 2 degrees C of warming, emissions would have to be about 30 percent lower than the new pledges, or about 39 gigatons each year. To hold warming to 1.5 degrees C requires a roughly 55 percent drop in emissions compared with the latest pledges, to about 25 gigatons a year.</p>



<p>“I’m hoping that the collision of the science and the statistics in the gap analysis, and the voices of the people will promote a greater sense of urgency,” says Gabriel Filippelli, a geochemist at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.</p>



<p>On October 26, Filippelli, the editor of the American Geophysical Union journal <em>GeoHealth</em>, and editors in chief of other journals published by the organization coauthored a statement in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. Theyurged world leaders at COP26 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL096644">to keep the “devastating impacts” of climate change in check</a> by immediately reducing global carbon emissions and shifting to a green economy. “We are scientists, but we also have families and loved ones alongside our fellow citizens on this planet,” the letter states. “The time to bridge the divide between scientist and citizen, head and heart, is now.”</p>



<p>Publishing that plea was a departure for some of the scientists, Filippelli says. “We have been publishing papers for the last 20 to 30 years, documenting the train wreck of climate change,” he says. “As you can imagine, behind the scenes there were some people who were a little uncomfortable because it veered away from the true science. But ultimately, we felt it was more powerful to write a true statement that showed our hearts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-needles-freeze-thaw-patterns">Here’s how ice needles sculpt patterns into cold, rocky landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neat rings, stripes and swirls embellish many cold, rocky landscapes. Although these beautiful stone patterns look like humanmade artwork, they’re all natural. Scientists have long known that such rocky patterns result from freezing and thawing. But precisely how they develop has been a mystery — until now.</p>



<p>New experiments reveal that so-called <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2110670118">“ice needles” can sort and organize rocks into many patterns</a>, Anyuan Li of the University of Tsukuba in Japan and colleagues report the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></p>



<p>“The beauty of [our] experiments is that you can actually see direct information on how the patterns form,” says Bernard Hallet of the University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied natural patterns in surface rocks around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="420" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-800x420.jpg" alt="zebra stripe landscape pattern" class="wp-image-3105038" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-800x420.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-680x357.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-330x173.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105038">Like zebra stripes, these ridges are all natural. They were photographed along an upper slope of the Haleakala volcanic crater on the Hawaiian island of Maui. This pattern formed on top of the gravelly surface as ice needles gradually separated stones from soil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105038">B. Hallet</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers spread pebbles atop a pan holding moist, fine-grained soil, then froze and thawed this mini-landscape over and over. When the moist soil had not yet frozen but the air temperature dropped below freezing, tiny, needlelike columns of ice sprouted up from the soil. These ice needles, each up to a few centimeters high, lifted any stones atop them. When temperatures rose again, the ice collapsed and the stones tumbled off. Because the ice needles curved as they grew, the stones tended to fall off their icy pedestals to one side.</p>



<p>Over many freeze-thaw cycles, the ice needles cleared patches of exposed soil. Since needles could more easily form in spots where there were fewer rocks in the way, they more efficiently cleared out any remaining pebbles. Stones were gradually shuffled into clusters between stone-free areas to form larger patterns. The pattern that builds on a landscape “strongly depends on its [local stone] concentration,” says study coauthor Quan-Xing Liu, a theoretical ecologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai.</p>

Hallet</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In lab experiments, the team “was able to able to get patterns after 30 freeze cycles,” says Hallet. That could equate to 30 cold nights — or 30 years, if each freeze lasted a whole winter. In the real world, Hallet says, some patterns might take “thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years to form.”</p>



<p>Using observations from their soil experiments, the researchers built a computer simulation of ice needle landscaping. This simulation could predict stone movement in the open environment under a range of conditions. The simulation confirmed that the rate of pattern formation depended on how dense the stone cover was, among other factors. The shapes and formation rates of patterns were also related to how moist the soil was, how the ground sloped and how tall the ice needles grew.</p>

</div><figcaption>As a miniature landscape made in the laboratory undergoes many freeze-thaw cycles, ice needles form and collapse, gradually shuffling stones into bunches, forming a larger pattern.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“We see identical patterns in different systems, such as fluids,” Hallet says of the rock formations. Materials with different characteristics or sizes often start all mixed together <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-nut-effect-mixed-nuts-xray-scan-physics">but don’t stay that way</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/21</em>). Phase separation is the process that morphs these mixes into patterns. The new study is among the first to show how phase separation applies to landscapes.</p>



<p>The combination of experiments and computer modelling in this study provides a new way to connect how natural landscapes form and how their materials behave, says Rachel Glade, a geologist at the University of Rochester in New York who was not involved in the work. This approach “is vital for our understanding of complex materials,” she adds, and it could help us understand how landscapes may evolve differently in a changing climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flamingo-feathers-dye-pink-biology">Flamingos dye their sun-faded feathers to stay pretty in pink</a></h4>

              
                <p>Greater flamingos apparently aren’t fans of a sun-faded look for their neck feathers.</p>



<p>Scientists have known that the leggy birds touch up their color by smearing their necks with a serum they produce glands near their tails. But greater flamingos (<em>Phoenicopterus roseus</em>) aren’t simply enhancing color that’s already there; they’re also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.8041">fighting the sun’s bleaching effect</a> on it, researchers report in the October <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. Feathers with a thicker coating of this serum held their color better than those with less, analysis shows.</p>



<p>Flamingos’ feathers help the birds fly, keep their bodies dry and attract mates. The feathers get their red color from carotenoids, molecules responsible for many natural pigments, found in the birds’ steady diet of brine shrimp and algae.</p>



<p>When flamingos preen, they care for their feathers a bit like how we care for our hair, cleaning out accumulated dirt and parasites. And like some of us, they add color. To apply their DIY feather dye, flamingos rub their cheeks on a gland above their tail called the uropygial gland, which generates a color-carrying serum. The birds then rub their serum-coated cheeks on their feathers and sway their necks to make sure the dye sticks. All that effort, paired with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36242">some slick dance moves</a>, is aimed at attracting potential mates.</p>





<p>But the sun’s ultraviolet radiation can break down carotenoids. That got Maria Cecilia Chiale, a biologist at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina, wondering if flamingos lose their color without constant reapplication of the serum. If so, that might help explain their instinct to constantly “touch up” their plumage.</p>



<p>Chiale and her collaborators collected dozens of neck feathers from flamingos in France that had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/french-flamingos-froze-death-without-freezing">died in a cold snap</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/14</em>). The team scanned the feathers and used Adobe Photoshop to analyze their color, and then placed half of them on a roof, exposed to sunlight. The other half were kept in darkness. Forty days later, new scans to analyze the feathers’ color intensity showed that the exposed feathers were sun-faded and paler than those kept in the dark.</p>



<p>Before the exposure experiment, Chiale had extracted carotenoids from both the surface and interior of each feather. After exposure, she found that feathers with a greater concentration of carotenoids had kept more color. That suggests that the birds had applied more serum to those feathers, letting them withstand fading better than those with a thinner coating.</p>



<p>Flamingos actively work to maintain their blushed necks throughout their lengthy display season as they prepare to mate, the research suggests; otherwise, they’d have pale feathers.</p>



<p>“Preening behaviors … have great social importance for flamingos because they live in large flocks and have synchronized behavior,” says Henrique Delfino, an ecologist at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil who was not involved in the study. “Initially, the behavior was for [waterproofing], but since it reinforces the color signal of the feathers … it helps in the social communication of flamingos.” Without flashy feathers to advertise their health, flamingos probably struggle to find a partner.</p>



<p>All that preening to prevent feather fade doesn’t continue forever, though. Once they’ve snagged a mate and successfully hatched a chick, Chiale says, flamingos put the dye away, at least until the next year’s mating season. The concentration of carotenoids in the serum drops dramatically, and the flamingos apply it far less frequently.</p>



<p>“They don’t need to have makeup on while they’re raising the kids,” she says. They need that energy to take care of their chicks.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Rumination is a key feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. According to the charity <a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/types/">OCD UK</a>, rumination is a “train of prolonged thinking about a question or theme that is undirected and unproductive” — worrying incessantly about a particular issue or question, in other words. Those with OCD may also ruminate on their symptoms themselves: rather than just dwelling on their fears of harming someone or on existential worries, for example, they will also worry about having these thoughts in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s this rumination about symptoms that a team of researchers explore in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-81553-001">new study </a>in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. They find that this kind of rumination can prolong depression in those with OCD, suggesting interventions focusing on ruminative patterns could be one way of addressing the distress of such experiences.</p>



<span id="more-44208"></span>



<p>Participants were visitors to inpatient and outpatient clinics specialising in treating OCD, as well as members of a self-help peer support group. First, they completed standardised measures of mood, the severity of their obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptoms, and their baseline level of rumination.</p>



<p>Before the experiment proper started, participants also identified an obsessive thought that would likely cause distress when spoken aloud. They then discussed this with a member of the research team, writing down and reading aloud a few sentences about the potential consequences of the thought. Finally, participants indicated their level of distress and their desire to neutralise that distress.</p>



<p>After &#8220;activating&#8221; the obsessive thought in this way, participants were asked to think about whatever they wanted in the next five minutes, recording how many times they thought about what they had written down and then again rating their level of distress and urge to neutralise.</p>



<p>Participants were then split into three groups. In each condition, individuals saw 28 statements and questions. In the rumination on OCD condition, these statements included “what would happen if your obsessions and compulsions persisted”; in the rumination on mood condition, “what would happen if your current mental state persisted”; and in the distraction condition more neutral statements such as “think about the shadow of a stop sign”.</p>



<p>Finally, at the end of this phase of the experiment participants again rated their feelings of distress, urge to neutralise, and depressed mood, and then completed another five minute session of monitoring their thoughts and rating themselves again.</p>



<p>Compared to those in the control condition, participants who ruminated on their symptoms or mood saw less of a decrease in distress, urge to neutralise and depressed mood by the end of the experiment. The frequency of obsessive thoughts also declined to a smaller degree in these conditions than in the distraction condition. There was no significant difference between the rumination on OCD and rumination on mood conditions.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that rumination on symptoms or mood can actually maintain those symptoms. Those who are distracted from rumination, however, may be less likely to experience ongoing levels of distress.</p>



<p>The results are unlikely to reflect the reality of ruminations for those with OCD: because episodes of ruminations are often extremely long, the effects of eight minutes of rumination in this experiment are potentially an underestimation of those someone may experience in real life settings. Looking more closely at a natural setting could provide further insight. The team also used a &#8220;counter&#8221; technique, with participants indicating how many times they had experienced a obsessive thought: whether this was able to fully capture the obsessive and ongoing nature of such thoughts is also a question worth pondering.</p>



<p>In terms of intervention, the team suggests techniques that supplement the standard CBT many of those with OCD receive, including trying to practise an “observing, non-judgemental and accepting stance” towards the occurrence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. They also note the questions the results raise about distraction. While distraction is often seen as maladaptive, this study showed it had positive effects — so, while perhaps not a long-term strategy, it could be a short-term balm for those struggling with rumination of any kind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">Astronomers may have spotted the first known exoplanet in another galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers may have spotted the first known planet in another galaxy.</p>



<p>The potential world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01495-w">called M51-ULS-1b</a>, orbits both a massive star and a dead star in the Whirlpool galaxy, about 28 million light-years from Earth. The object’s existence, if confirmed, suggests that there could be many other extragalactic exoplanets waiting to be discovered, astronomers report October 25 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>“We probably always assumed there would be planets” in other galaxies, says astrophysicist Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “But to actually find something, it’s a beautiful thing. It’s a humbling experience.”</p>



<p>More than 4,800 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the sun, all of them inside the Milky Way. There’s no reason to think that other galaxies don’t also host planets. But the most popular exoplanet hunting techniques are difficult to do with such faraway stars, which blend together too much to observe them one by one.</p>





<p>In 2018, Di Stefano and astrophysicist Nia Imara of the University of California, Santa Cruz suggested <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab903">searching for planets around extragalactic X-ray binaries</a>.</p>



<p>X-ray binaries usually consist of a massive star and the remains of a second massive star, which has collapsed into a neutron star or a black hole. The dead star steals material from the living star and heats it to such hot temperatures that it emits bright X-rays that stand out from the crowd of other stars.</p>



<p>That X-ray region can be smaller than a giant planet, meaning if a planet crosses, or transits, in front of such a system from astronomers’ perspective on Earth, it could temporarily block all the X-rays, revealing the planet’s presence.</p>



<p>Di Stefano and colleagues searched archived data from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-chandra-x-ray-telescope-celebrates-20-years-space">NASA’s Chandra X-ray telescope</a> for signs of blinking X-ray sources (<em>SN: 7/25/19</em>). The team looked at a total of 2,624 possible transits in three galaxies: M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy), M101 (the Pinwheel galaxy) and M104 (the Sombrero galaxy).</p>



<p>Only one turned up a clear planetlike signal. On September 20, 2012, an object had blocked all of the X-rays from the X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 for about three hours.</p>



<p>“We said, ‘Wow. Could this be it?’” Di Stefano says.</p>



<p>After ruling out gas clouds passing in front of the binary, fluctuations in the X-ray source itself or other explanations for the dip, Di Stefano and colleagues conclude that the object was most likely a Saturn-sized planet orbiting the X-ray binary hundreds of times the distance between Earth and the sun.</p>



<p>This isn’t a comfortable environment for the planet. “You don’t want to be there,” Di Stefano notes. Despite its distance from the X-ray binary, the planet receives as much energy in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scalding-hot-gas-giant-breaks-heat-records">hot Jupiter</a> exoplanet, which orbits its star in just a few days, receives from an ordinary star (<em>SN: 6/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>“The possibility that the team discovered the transit of an extragalactic planet is quite intriguing and would be a great discovery,” says astrophysicist Ignazio Pillitteri of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in Palermo. He would like to see the transit happen again to confirm it.</p>



<p>Not everyone finds the result convincing. “I find the paper very speculative,” says astrophysicist Matthew Bailes of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. If the planet is real, finding it relied on a lot of coincidences: Its orbit needed to be perfectly aligned with the point of view from Earth, and it needed to just happen to be passing in front of the X-ray binary while Chandra was looking.</p>



<p>Di Stefano counters that the fact that her team saw a signal within such a small number of observations suggests there are lots of extragalactic planets out there. “Maybe we were lucky,” she acknowledges. “But I think it’s very likely that we were not special. We looked and we found something because there was something to find.”</p>



<p>Di Stefano doesn’t expect to see this particular planet again in her lifetime. It could take decades for it to pass in front of its host stars again. “The real test,” she says, “is finding more planets.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-blueprint-olmec-maya-ceremonial-archaeology">Lidar reveals a possible blueprint for many Olmec and Maya ceremonial sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unexpected architectural tradition linked many Olmec and Maya societies of Mesoamerica, an ancient cultural area that ran from central Mexico to Central America.</p>



<p>Starting as early as around 3,400 years ago and for roughly the next two millennia, those communities constructed ceremonial centers based on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01218-1">a common blueprint</a>. That plan was grounded in ideas about space, the calendar and possibly beliefs about the universe, researchers report October 25 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>



<p>An airborne remote-sensing technique called light detection and ranging, or lidar, revealed 478 rectangular and square ceremonial centers across Mexico’s southern Gulf Coast, over an area roughly the size of Ireland. Lidar maps detected remnants of ceremonial centers dotting the landscape in an Olmec homeland area and stretching westward around 500 kilometers to the Maya lowlands, say archaeologist Takeshi Inomata of the University of Arizona in Tucson and his colleagues.</p>



<p>Olmec society dates from around 3,500 to 2,400 years ago. Its relation to later Maya culture is unclear, although Maya and Olmec people may have influenced each other’s cultures between 3,000 and 2,800 years ago, Inomata suspects.</p>





<p>“The discovery of standardized [ceremonial] complexes across this broad area, many of them having rectangular shapes, forces us to rethink what was happening during this period,” Inomata says. A continuous 2,000-year tradition of ceremonial complex construction now appears to have characterized Mesoamerican settlements of various sizes and political arrangements.</p>



<p>New lidar data from so many Mesoamerican sites “reveals an astonishing reality — the sheer vastness of what we didn’t know about the emergence of urbanism in this part of the world,” says archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli of Tulane University in New Orleans, who was not part of Inomata’s team.</p>



<p>Although ground surveys and excavations of lidar-detected sites are in the early stages, many probably date to between 1050 B.C. and 400 B.C. Inomata’s team has surveyed 62 sites in a western portion of the lidar-mapped area and excavated five of them.</p>



<p>In a major revelation, lidar data detected a previously unrecognized ceremonial space at an early Olmec settlement called San Lorenzo. Dating to between 1400 B.C. and 1150 B.C., this area consisted of 20 rectangular earthen mounds bordering a large, rectangular plaza.</p>

<p>San Lorenzo’s ceremonial center provided the original framework for corresponding constructions at later sites, Inomata’s team says. Until this discovery, San Lorenzo’s layout had been viewed as different from all other sites in the region.</p>



<p>Later complexes included rectangular or square plazas surrounded by 20 mounds. That number probably represented the base unit of Mesoamerican calendars, which were used to organize ritual activities, the scientists say. Some centers were built along an east-to-west axis that aligned with the sunrise on ritually important days of the year.</p>



<p>A site previously excavated by Inomata and his colleagues contains the largest rectangular ceremonial complex discovered so far. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico">Aguada Fénix</a> in the western Maya lowlands features an elevated, rectangular plateau that measures about 1,400 meters long and nearly 400 meters wide (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). That site dates to around 3,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Frequent contacts among diverse societies across the region resulted in the initial spread of the San Lorenzo ceremonial blueprint and the adoption of a sequence of four variations on that theme over the next 2,000 years, Inomata’s team suggests. Shared ceremonial center configurations appeared despite differences in Mesoamerican political systems. For instance, colossal head sculptures at San Lorenzo and another Olmec center, La Venta, reflect the presence there of class systems run by kings and a ruling elite. But other sites with ceremonial centers, including Aguada Fénix, show no signs of ruling classes or marked social inequality.</p>



<p>Innovations in building ceremonial complexes appear to have emerged elsewhere possibly by around 100 years after San Lorenzo got the ball rolling, Estrada-Belli says. Around 3,000 years ago, for instance, structures that lidar data indicate were added to the basic ceremonial configuration at Aguada Fénix, as well as architectural twists originating at several other Gulf Coast sites, began spreading to other parts of the region, he says. Inomata’s lidar evidence “shows that San Lorenzo was one of multiple places of monumental architectural innovation.”</p>



<p>So many <a href="https://doi.org/10138/s41562-021-01219-0">commonalities link the newly identified ceremonial complexes</a> across Mexico’s Gulf Coast that it’s hard to sort their builders into different cultures, says archaeologist Robert Rosenswig of the University at Albany in New York, who did not participate in the lidar study. “It would be realistic to refer to them all as Olmec, especially as the architecture of Maya in Guatemala and Belize seems to be quite different,” he says.</p>



<p>Lidar surveys are uncovering shared architectural designs, layouts and orientations across other Mesoamerican regions, adds Rosenswig, who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>. Rosenswig has contributed to research documenting such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/money-ancient-origins-debate-mystery">consistencies in a network of city-states</a> on the Pacific coast of southern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador that flourished between around 2,800 and 2,100 years ago (<em>SN: 7/29/18</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-vision-eyes-color-senses-hearing-mating-courtship">Jumping spiders’ remarkable senses capture a world beyond our perception</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Imagine that the world is shades of gray and a little blurry, almost as if your lousy peripheral vision has taken over. This fuzzy field of view extends so far that you can make out dim shapes and motion behind you as well; no need to turn your head. The one bright spot is an X-shaped splash of color that moves with your gaze. At the center of this splash, everything is crisp and clear — a small window of sharp, colorful detail in a gauzy grayscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add some blades of grass the size of redwood trees, and you’ve got an inkling of what the world looks like through the eight eyes of a jumping spider. It might be a bit like watching a poorly focused black-and-white movie on a 3-D IMAX screen that wraps around the room, while you hold a spotlight shining high-definition color wherever you point it. In other words, it’s really, really strange, at least compared with our two-eyed human perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jumping spiders, which are the family Salticidae, are best known for their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/male-peacock-spiders-best-dancers-get-girl">hilariously flamboyant mating dances</a>, their large front eyes that make for adorable close-ups and their itty-bitty size — some of the more than 6,000 known species of jumping spiders are smaller than a sesame seed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But scientists are discovering that there’s much more to these diminutive arachnids. Researchers are getting a sense of what it’s like to be another animal by doing innovative experiments to go deeper into these spiders’ lives, probing their ability to see, feel and taste.</p>





<p>“Part of why I study insects and spiders is this act of imagination that is required to really try to get into the completely alien world and mind and perceptual reality of these animals,” says visual ecologist Nathan Morehouse of the University of Cincinnati.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Eye of the spider&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Unlike bees and flies, which have compound eyes that merge information from hundreds or thousands of lenses into a single, pixelated mosaic image, the jumping spider has camera-type eyes, similar to those of humans and most other vertebrates. Each of the spider’s eyes has a single lens that focuses light onto a retina.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principal eyes — the big forward-facing ones that just beg us to anthropomorphize — have incredibly high resolution for creatures that are usually between 2 and 20 millimeters long. Their eyesight is sharper than any other spider’s and is the secret behind their ability to stalk and pounce on prey with impressive precision. Their sight is comparable to that of much larger animals like pigeons, cats and elephants. In fact, human visual acuity is only about five to 10 times better than a jumping spider’s.</p>

<p>“Given that you can fit a lot of spiders in one single human eyeball, that is pretty remarkable,” says animal behavior researcher Ximena Nelson, who studies jumping spiders at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. “In terms of size-for-size, there’s just no comparison whatsoever to the type of spatial acuity that jumping spider eyes can achieve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that sharp vision covers only a small portion of the spider’s field of view. Each of the two principal eyes sees a narrow, boomerang-shaped strip of the world. Together they form an “X” of high-resolution color vision. An adjacent pair of smaller, less sharp eyes scans a wide field of view in black and white, watching for things that need the attention of the big high-resolution eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the side of the spider’s head are two more pairs of lower-resolution eyes that any human parent would envy. They let the spider monitor what’s happening behind it, a nearly 360-degree view that’s a real advantage for a small animal that is both hunter and prey. Indeed, a jumping spider might consider our 210-degree field of view rather pitiful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in other ways, a jumping spider’s visual world is not so different from ours. The animal’s principal eyes and first set of secondary eyes together do basically the same job as our two eyes with our high-acuity central vision and low-resolution peripheral vision. Like the spider, we focus our attention on a relatively small area and largely ignore the rest until something catches our attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I totally think of them as completely analogous,” Nelson says. “The jumping spider’s solution is exactly the solution we’ve adopted. They’ve just adopted it in a much smaller manner.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Giving the side eye</h4>



<p>Each of the jumping spider’s four pairs of eyes has a different job and behaves independently, but they all work together. This cooperation opens up intriguing research possibilities for behavioral ecologist Elizabeth Jakob of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I’m really interested in how the eyes collaborate,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jakob uses an ophthalmoscope modified to create a spider eye tracker. With removable adhesive, she tethers a female <em>Phidippus audax</em> to the end of a small plastic stick. Then, she hangs the stick with its spider in front of the eye tracker, the spider perched on a little ball facing a video screen. Once the spider is in position, Jakob plays videos. As the spider watches, she records how the principal eyes react.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tracker shines an infrared light at the retinas of the principal eyes while a video camera records the reflected, X-shaped field of view. The reflection is later superimposed on the video the spider viewed, revealing exactly what the spider’s principal eyes were focused on. For a human, watching the combined video is like peering through a portal into the spider’s visual world.</p>



<p>Jakob teases out the relationships between the eyes by showing various images to different eye pairs. In a study published April 15 in the<em> Journal of Experimental Biology</em>, Jakob and her colleagues tried to determine which kinds of objects seen by the secondary eyes would prompt a spider to swing the principal eyes over for a sharper look. This test probes more than just how the eyes work together; it gets at <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/224/8/jeb231035/239722/Attention-and-distraction-in-the-modular-visual">what’s important to a jumping spider</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s just so interesting to see what captures their attention,” Jakob says. “To just get this little window into their mind.”</p>



<p>First, a silhouette of a cricket — an appealing meal for a jumping spider — appears on the screen. You can tell when the spider’s principal eyes have locked onto the cricket because the boomerangs start wiggling, rapidly scanning the silhouette while slightly twisting one way and then the other. The spider’s principal eyes can do this sort of visual gymnastics because the retinas are at the back of two long, independently movable tubes, each controlled by six muscles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out what might draw the spider’s focus away from the cricket, Jakob adds other images to an area of the screen that is within the field of view of the secondary eyes. Any interest in a black oval? Nope. Maybe a black cross? Or another cricket? Not impressed. How about a black oval that is shrinking? Still no. What if the oval is getting bigger? Bingo: The boomerangs quickly flit over to the expanding oval to get a better look.</p>



<p>A jumping spider’s principal eyes can concentrate on preparing to pounce on dinner, while the other eyes notice and ignore any number of less relevant things. But if those secondary eyes spot something that’s getting bigger, well, that could be an approaching predator that requires immediate attention. It’s a nifty design — one that could make an easily distracted human jealous.</p>



<p>“We’re swimming in a sea of potential stimuli all the time,” Jakob says. One way to filter that information is to prioritize, focusing attention on some things over others. “This is certainly familiar to any human trying to focus on reading one thing.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How to see what a spider sees</h3>

<p>A jumping spider perched on a foam ball (and tethered in place with a plastic stick and removable adhesive) watches videos while a special eye tracker records where the spider’s principal eyes are looking. Researchers can tell that a jumping spider is focusing its principal eyes on a cricket silhouette when the white X lands and stays on the cricket, as seen in the video below. While the principal eyes focus on the cricket, the researchers add shapes like a growing or receding oval in view of the secondary eyes. Only when the oval is growing do the principal eyes shift their focus to the oval. An object growing in the periphery just might be an approaching predator.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on color</h4>



<p>Among mammals, humans and many other primates have exceptional color vision. Most people can see three colors of light — red, blue and green — and all the various combinations of hues in between. Many other mammals typically see just some shades of blue and green light. Many spiders may also have a crude form of color vision, but for them it’s usually based on green and ultraviolet light, which extends their vision into the deep violet end of the spectrum beyond what humans can see, and covers the blue and purple hues in between.</p>



<p>But some jumping spiders see even more. While at the University of Pittsburgh, Morehouse led a team that discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215003486">certain species have a filter</a> squashed between two layers of green-sensitive photo-receptors that allows these spiders to detect red light in a small area at the center of their principal eye field of view. This adds red, orange and yellow hues to their world, which, along with the UV, gives them an even wider rainbow of colors than humans.</p>



<p>Seeing red can be handy since it’s often used as a warning, in nature as well as in the human&#8211;engineered world of red lights and stop signs. For jumping spiders, the ability to see red may have evolved as a way to avoid toxic prey. But once this new world of color was available to the spiders, they put it to good use. “The evolution of color vision seems to be followed by the rapid use of the new colors that they can see in courtship,” Morehouse says.</p>



<p>Using Jakob’s eye tracker, Morehouse is testing female jumping spiders to see what interests them about the colorful, frenetic dances males use to woo them. He’s finding that suitors employ a combination of movement and color that seems specifically designed to capture and hold a female’s attention by playing to her various eyes. She can only see color within the boomerang&#8211;shaped view of her principal eyes, and the red, orange and yellow hues only at the center. Unless he can grab the attention of her secondary eyes with movement, she won’t turn her principal eyes toward him and may never see his fabulously colored features. And for him, this could be a matter of life and death, because an unimpressed female may decide to make a meal of him instead.</p>



<p>The males of one species Morehouse studies, <em>Habronattus pyrrithrix</em>, have a dazzling red face and beautiful lime-green front legs. Yet the females seem most impressed by the orange knees on the males’ third set of legs. When a male first spots a female, he raises his front legs like he’s directing a plane into its gate and skitters side to side, hoping to catch the attention of her secondary eyes. When she turns his way, he comes closer and starts flicking the wrist joints at the end of his raised front limbs. You can almost hear him saying, “Hey lady, over here!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once he’s drawn her attention, out come the orange knees. “They move them up behind their back into view in a kind of a peekaboo display,” Morehouse says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>As part of his showy courtship dance, a male <em>Habronattus pyrrithrix</em> waves his front legs as if to say, “Look at me,” then lifts the bright orange knees of two back legs. The female (foreground) is transfixed. Within minutes, he’s won her over.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To find out exactly what it is about a male’s display that turns a female’s head, Morehouse uses a bit of subterfuge. He doctors videos of males dancing, then plays the videos to a female perched in an eye tracker to see how each of the changes affects her attention. If the male has an orange knee hiked up, but it’s not moving, she’s less interested. If the knees are moving but the orange color is removed, she’ll look but quickly lose interest. He’s got to have both the right look and the right moves.</p>



<p>“He’s using motion to influence where she’s looking, and then he’s using color to hold her attention there,” Morehouse says.</p>



<p>Behavioral ecologist Lisa Taylor of the University of Florida in Gainesville, likens the males’ tactics to those of human advertisers. “It feels like a lot of the tricks that marketers use to influence our decisions,” Taylor says. “Understanding the psychology of spiders sometimes feels similar to understanding the psychology of humans.”</p>



<h4>Can you feel it?</h4>



<p>The leg-waving, knee-popping spectacle of the male courtship display is meant to capture female attention. But this dance is only one part of the show, behavioral ecologist Damian Elias of the University of California, Berkeley discovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many spiders use vibrations to communicate, and there had been a few reports that jumping spiders were among them. When Elias investigated further, he found that male jumping spiders accompany their moves with a remarkably elaborate serenade of vibrations, sent through the ground to the females, beyond human perception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was a complete surprise to me,” Elias says. When he shared what he had found with other arachnologists, “they were just blown away.”</p>

</div><figcaption>Turn up your sound to hear a male jumping spider thumping, scraping and buzzing to impress a potential mate. The vibrations he makes with his legs and abdomen are sent through the ground to the female, beyond human perception. But researchers can pick up the seismic songs using laser vibrometry.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To eavesdrop on the spiders’ seismic songs, Elias <a href="https://www.biographic.com/lens-of-time-spider-seduction/">uses a laser vibrometer</a>, similar to technology used in the aeronautics industry to measure vibration of airplane components. He tethers a female spider onto a nylon surface stretched like a drumhead and then adds a male. When the male spots the female, he starts his song and dance, drumming his legs on the surface and vibrating his abdomen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vibrometer measures the vibration of the surface and translates it into airborne sound that humans can hear, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-48/issue-3/JoA-S-18-045/Complex-courtship-in-the-Habronattus-clypeatus-group-Araneae-Salticidae/10.1636/JoA-S-18-045.short">revealing an acoustic barrage of thumps, scrapes and buzzes</a>. Elias simultaneously records video of the courtship at 1,000 frames per second so he can slow it down to see how the sound and motion sync up. It’s like a miniature drum solo, perfectly matched to the spider’s flicks and kicks.</p>



<p>“We don’t have access to that without technology,” Elias says. “It’s kind of unlocking this secret world.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Good vibrations</h3>



<p>Male jumping spiders work hard to get and keep a potential mate’s attention. By tapping his front legs and oscillating his abdomen at various speeds, measured in hertz, or Hz, a male can produce three types of seismic signals that researchers can pick up using laser vibrometry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3105005" width="510" height="338" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3-579x383.png 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3-281x186.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3105005">D. ELIAS <em>ET AL/J. EXP. BIOL.</em> 2003</span></figcaption></figure></div>
</div>



<p>The jumping spider’s sensory world is filled with vibrations coming through the ground. But because those vibrations feel different depending on what the spider is standing on, things can change quickly as he hops from leaf to rock to soil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For humans, who sense sound vibrations through the air rather than the ground, Elias imagines it might be something like taking two steps and suddenly listening through water, and then another two steps and you’re surrounded by foam, and then back to air. The spiders’ entire sensory world is constantly changing, yet they adapt without missing a beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, take that alien auditory world and add the fact that jumping spiders also have chemical sensors at the tips of their legs. “They’re moving around, tasting everything that they’re walking on,” Elias says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very little is known about this aspect of the jumping spider’s sensorium, but the latest research out of Taylor’s Florida lab, published July 29 in the <em>Journal of Arachnology</em>, suggests that <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-49/issue-2/JoA-S-20-055/Males-respond-to-substrate-borne-not-airborne-female-chemical-cues/10.1636/JoA-S-20-055.full">male spiders may be hoping to taste traces of potential mates</a>. Most jumping spiders don’t build webs to capture prey; they stalk and pounce instead. But the spiders are constantly laying down a line of silk as they move about, a sort of safety rope in case they fall or need to make a quick escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, a male <em>H. pyrrithrix</em> could sense a female’s silk line when he stepped on it. Taylor’s lab is now testing whether a male spider can detect the difference between a silk trail that will lead him to a virgin female who might be willing to mate with him and a dragline left by a female who has already mated and might prefer to eat him.</p>



<p>“The more we learn, the more complicated it gets,” Taylor says. Jumping spiders “are so highly visual, and there’s so much vibrational stuff going on, and then the chemistry. It’s hard to imagine that it wouldn’t just be super overwhelming.”</p>



<p>Somehow, jumping spiders manage the sensory deluge quite well — they live just about everywhere on Earth. You’ve most likely seen one, possibly in your own house. Despite being so small, they are easy to identify if you know what you’re looking for — or what <em>they’re</em> looking for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Next time you see a spider in the middle of a wall, and you look at it, and it turns back and looks at you, that’s a jumping spider,” University of Canterbury’s Nelson says. “It’s detected your movement towards it with its secondary eyes, and it’s checking you out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That spider might just be imagining what the world looks like to a human. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Fly tigers</h3>



<p>One of the things jumping spiders use their unusually good vision for is, well, jumping. Instead of building webs to passively snare meals, the spiders prefer to hunt. Their ability to quickly and accurately pounce on insects and other spiders earned them the moniker “fly tiger” more than 500 years ago during the Ming dynasty in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists are learning just how apt the nickname is. At least one group of jumping spider species plans out strategic attacks involving elaborate detours to reach a target — the kind of clever hunting behavior typically ascribed to large-brained mammals like actual tigers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-410x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3105006" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-410x450.png 410w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-349x383.png 349w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-170x186.png 170w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-529x580.png 529w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105006">Starting on the middle tower on this platform, a jumping spider sets a course to reach the only box that is holding a meal.

CROSS <em>ET AL/FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY</em> 2020, ADAPTED BY T. TIBBITTS</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Some of the things that they do could keep you awake at night,” says arachnologist Fiona Cross of the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cross and renowned jumping spider expert Robert Jackson, also at Canterbury, have tested this group of species, including the clever <em>Portia fimbriata</em>, with all sorts of challenges in the lab. In one study, the team placed a spider atop a tower on a platform (shown here) surrounded by water, knowing that jumping spiders avoid water whenever possible. From the perch, the spider could see two other towers: one topped with a box containing prey and one with a box of dead leaves. Both were accessible from the platform by a raised walkway with multiple turns. After surveying the scene, most spiders climbed down the tower and chose the correct path to the target — even when that required initially heading away from the target, losing sight of the prey, and first passing the start of the incorrect walkway.</p>



<p>This feat suggests that the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jeab.189">spiders are capable of planning</a>, Cross and Jackson argued in 2016 in the <em>Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior</em>. The spiders came up with a strategy, and executed it. — <em>Betsy Mason</em></p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Most parents will be very familiar with the concept of separation anxiety. It’s hardly rare for babies and toddlers to become anxious when separated from a parent. But I have to confess, I hadn’t heard of Adult Separation Anxiety (ASA) until I came across <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-87930-005">this new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. For adults, it can manifest as extreme distress at being separated from a partner, or another loved one — even a pet. And it’s thought that <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1074">7% of people</a> suffer from it at some point in their lifetimes.</p>



<p>Partly because ASA has been so neglected by researchers, Megan Finsaas at Columbia University and Daniel Klein at Stony Brook University set out to better understand it — and specifically, to explore links with aspects of personality.</p>



<span id="more-44203"></span>



<p>The pair studied data on US-based mothers from 609 families involved in an ongoing study of potential links between children’s temperament and their risk of developing depression. Finsaas and Klein analysed responses to various surveys gathered every three years over a nine-year period. The mothers reported on any symptoms of adult separation anxiety (such as anxiety at the prospect of being separated from a loved one, or fears that that person may suffer harm), mood and also personality. The key personality scale that was used, <a href="https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/multidimensional-personality-questionnaire-short-form-mps/">a short form of the the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ)</a>, assessed the traits of negative emotionality, positive emotionality &nbsp;and constraint (which includes measures of control and harm avoidance). It also assessed the trait of absorption; someone who ranks highly for absorption is prone become wrapped up in their own mental imagery. For some of the women, the researchers also had access to MPQ assessments of them made by their own partners.</p>



<p>Finsaas and Klein found “substantial” links between symptoms of Adult Separation Anxiety and negative emotionality — and particularly, with scores on the subscale of &#8220;stress reaction&#8221;. People who score highly on this often describe themselves as being tense and nervous and prone to worry. (And a tendency to worry maps onto aspects of separation anxiety, including fear that the loved one will come to some kind of harm, the researchers point out.) The mothers with higher ASA scores were also more likely to report greater feelings of vulnerability. This fits with an idea from research on separation anxiety disorder in children — that these children overestimate the dangers of being left alone, and underestimate their ability to function independently.</p>



<p>The results also suggested a link between aggression and ASA. Though aggression is not among the characteristics of ASA listed in DSM-5, it is recognised in children with separation anxiety disorder. For adults, it might stem from a desperation to keep their attachment figure close, when other efforts to do this have failed. Some researchers even suggest that this type of aggression could be linked to at least some cases of domestic violence.</p>



<p>Absorption also emerged as being linked to ASA scores. High levels of absorption have been related in other work to feelings of unity with objects outside the self — such as another person. “For someone with separation anxiety, when an attachment figure leaves, it may feel like a part of the self is leaving and thus be particularly threatening and painful,” Finsaas and Klein write.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that having a &#8220;negative temperament&#8221; (as assessed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_942-2">another questionnaire</a>) was linked to a higher risk of developing ASA three years later.</p>



<p>The study does have some limitations. The participants were all mothers who began providing data when they had a child of about three at home — and having young children may worsen ASA, the researchers write. Most of these women were also White, middle class and in their late 30s and early 40s, restricting generalisability. Also, the nature of the data the pair had to work with means it’s also possible that ASA itself influences personality over time, rather than certain personalities being predisposed to ASA.</p>



<p>However, given that so little work has been done to understand links between personality and adult separation anxiety, this provides a great base for further investigation. And in theory, a better understanding of these links could help with spotting people at risk of developing adult separation anxiety, or with tailoring treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">What does the first successful test of a pig-to-human kidney transplant mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Surgeons in New York City successfully attached a pig kidney to a human patient and watched the pinkish organ function normally for 54 hours. While such procedures have been done in nonhuman primates, this is the first time that a pig kidney has been transplanted to a human body and not been immediately rejected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The procedure, <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/progress-xenotransplantation-opens-door-new-supply-critically-needed-organs">announced in a news conference</a> October 21, marks progress toward the goal of drastically expanding the supply of life-saving organs.&nbsp;Millions of people around the world are waiting for donated organs, many of which never come.</p>



<p>While the details of the procedure have not yet been peer reviewed nor published in a journal, “it’s a significant step,” says Megan Sykes, an immunologist at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the research. But there are many more steps to be taken before patients waiting for a kidney can easily get one from a pig, she says.</p>



<p>Here are answers to some basic questions about the milestone.</p>





<h3>Why pigs?</h3>



<p>“We’re never going to satisfy the organ shortage problem with human organs,” says John Scandling, a nephrologist at Stanford University who wasn’t involved in this research. “There’s a limit to the number of deceased donor organs that are viable,” and too few donations from living people.</p>



<p>In the United States, over 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, about 90 percent of whom need a kidney. But in 2019, less than 40,000 transplantations occurred. About <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">17 people die each day</a> while waiting for an organ, according to the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration.</p>



<p>Scientists have long sought to solve this shortage by using animal organs, a field known as xenotransplantation. Pigs have emerged as the primary focus of this research, since their organs are anatomically similar to human organs, and the animals can be bred in a highly controlled manner.</p>



<p>But simply transplanting another species’s organ into a person causes the immune system to revolt at the presence of a large, foreign object. When researchers tried such experiments using nonhuman primates in the mid-20th century, the scientists found that the transplanted organ would quickly turn black. “You could visibly see the organs fail in those days because there’s an immediate reaction,” Scandling says. That immediate reaction, called a hyperacute rejection, is the first major obstacle for a xenotransplant to stick.</p>



<p>In recent decades, genetic engineering has overcome some of these challenges. Scientists learned that the aggressive immune response seen after a pig xenotransplant is spurred on by antibodies that detect a specific sugar molecule called alpha-gal that dots pig blood vessels. It’s the same sugar molecule responsible for some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lone-star-tick-may-play-part-heart-disease-arteries">allergic reactions to red meat</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/18</em>).</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, scientists devised ways of disabling the pig gene responsible for this sugar.&nbsp;Subsequent studies have shown that kidneys and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baboons-survive-6-months-after-getting-pig-heart-transplant">other organs</a> from pigs with this gene disabled can be successfully transplanted to nonhuman primates, including baboons (<em>SN: 12/5/18</em>). But until now, a test of this sort of transplant hadn’t been done successfully in people.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What did the researchers do?</h3>



<p>Performing a first-of-its-kind operation like this on a living person raises many ethical questions. But in late September, the family of a woman who was brain-dead but kept alive on a ventilator consented to the operation, according to Robert Montgomery, a surgeon at NYU Langone Health in New York City who led the surgical team.&nbsp;She was taken off life support after the procedure.</p>



<p>The woman was an organ donor, but her organs were not suitable for donation. “I want to [acknowledge] how grateful we are to the family of the decedent, who in a time of profound grief, found a way to help their loved one realize her desire to give a gift to humanity at the time of her death,” Montgomery said at the news conference in New York City.</p>



<p>Over two hours, Montgomery and his team carefully attached a kidney from a pig genetically engineered to lack the alpha-gal sugar to blood vessels in the upper leg of the patient. The kidney was kept outside of the body so the team could assess its function in real time. The pig’s thymus gland, which can help educate the immune system to recognize the kidney as part of the body, was also transplanted with the organ to improve its chances of acceptance, Montgomery said. Drugs that suppress the immune system were also administered.</p>



<p>Within minutes, the kidney started producing large amounts of urine and showed other signs of normal functioning. The team kept close tabs on the kidney for 54 hours and saw no signs of rejection. “The pig kidney functioned just like a human kidney transplant,” Montgomery said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team stopped monitoring at 54 hours per guidance from ethics reviewers.</p>



<h3>How big of a deal is the transplant?</h3>



<p>To scientists who have been working in xenotransplantation, the news is welcome and important but not terribly surprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were all pretty confident that hyperacute rejection wouldn’t happen,” says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He notes that pig kidneys of the sort used in this procedure have lasted in nonhuman primates for over a year.</p>



<p>“It’s a proof of principle,” Vagefi says, “but it didn’t really move the needle in terms of the science,” though details of how the surgeons did the procedure could provide a clearer picture of how the patient’s immune system responded, for example.</p>



<p>Peter Cowan, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia agrees. “This is completely as expected, but nevertheless it is an important piece of evidence to support moving to clinical trials of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation.”</p>



<h3>What’s next for these sort of transplants?</h3>



<p>Surviving for 54 hours is a crucial first step, but “nobody needs a kidney for three days,” Vagefi says. Before pig-grown organs can go mainstream, researchers will have to demonstrate that the organs can survive attacks from other players in the immune system and last for months or years in the human body.</p>



<p>For example, over time T-cells, a type of white blood cell, can come to recognize the transplanted organ as foreign and attack. Immunosuppressing drugs can help mitigate these sorts of responses, though the side effects of such drugs, such as susceptibility to infectious diseases, can be a major burden.</p>



<p>Including the pig’s thymus gland, which helps make immune system cells and antibodies, along with the kidney, may help lessen this longer-term rejection, says Kazuhiko Yamada, a surgeon and immunologist at Columbia University who has worked on this method in nonhuman primates for decades. “It’s like a teacher that can educate [the immune system] to not attack the kidney.”</p>



<p>Researchers will also have to show that such transplants are safe in the long-term to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Yamada says. For example, pig organs can contain retroviruses that lie dormant in genes. Some researchers are using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-creates-virus-free-piglets">remove those viruses</a> to potentially improve safety (<em>SN: 8/10/17</em>).</p>



<p>Pigs may be able to provide other organs too, such as hearts or livers, though different organs present their own challenges.</p>



<p>“We’ve been working on this for 20 years,” Yamada says, and now it seems “we’re rounding the final corner and can see the finish line.” But exactly how long it will take before someone in need of a kidney can easily get it from a pig remains to be seen, he says.</p>



<h3>Is raising pigs to harvest their organs ethical?</h3>



<p>A future where potentially millions of pigs are raised to harvest their organs for humans raises significant ethical questions. “Pigs aren’t spare parts and should never be used as such just because humans are too self-centered to donate their bodies to patients desperate for organ transplants,” the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, said <a href="https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-self-centered-humans-should-fix-organ-shortage-not-use-pigs/?v2=1null">in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advocates for xenotransplantation argue the potential benefits of vastly expanding the organ supply are worth any potential harm done to pigs.</p>



<p>“​​Nearly half of the patients waiting for a transplant become too sick or die before receiving one,” said Montgomery, the NYU surgeon. “The traditional paradigm that someone has to die for someone else to live is never going to keep up with the ever increasing incidence of organ failure.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The topic of water fluoridation and oral health addresses both Maha&#8217;s and Morenike&#8217;s research interests. Maha El Tantawi, a Professor of Dental Public Health at Alexandria University, Egypt, and Morenike, a Professor of Paediatric Dentistry at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, often collaborate to investigate the social determinants associated with early childhood caries and oral health status in Nigeria. Maha also researches the impact of public health measures, such as sugar tax and tobacco cessation counselling, on dental health. As well as investigating the risk factors associated with childhood caries, Morenike researches dental anxiety management and the determinants of oral health in marginalised communities. Morenike focuses on community engagement in research and supports the prompt translation of evidence-based research to policies and programs to reduce inequality and improve health and well-being for all. In this blog, Maha and Morenike discuss the articles included in the Collection and how they support the SDGs.</span></p>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BMC Oral Health Collection &#8211; Something in the Water: Fluoridation and Caries</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fluoride is well known to have beneficial effects on dental health by helping to prevent cavities. Therefore, as a public health measure, fluoride is often added to community water supplies. However, when present in drinking water above the World Health Organisation&#8217;s (WHO&#8217;s) recommended concentration, long term exposure can lead to a disease called fluorosis. Fluorosis is characterised by staining and pitting of the teeth but can cause painful damage to bones and joints in severe cases. Therefore, communities must have access to drinking water containing safe levels of fluoride. As a result, water fluoridation is an important discussion topic among dentists, public health practitioners, policymakers and stakeholders interested in oral health and well-being. The review on water fluoridation strategy in England included in the Collection by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-020-01102-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wordley and Bedi</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is an excellent example of such discussion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Collection aligns with multiple SDGs, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#3</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#6</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#8</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#10</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. For example, the Collection supports </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#3</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by further demonstrating the well-known anti-caries effect of fluorides; this information helps to ensure good health and well-being for all. </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01598-w#auth-Lina-Stangvaltaite_Mouhat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stangvaltaite-Mouhat</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> et al. examined the association between fluoride levels in the drinking water and the susceptibility of different tooth surfaces to caries in Lithuanian adults. The researchers found that higher levels of fluoride (≥ 0.7 ppm) in the drinking water was associated with lower levels of dental caries in all tooth surface groups.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Research within the Collection also aligns with </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #6</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to &#8220;achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all&#8221; and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #10</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which aims for reduced inequalities. The process of water fluoridation includes adjusting the concentration of fluoride in community water to predetermined levels to ensure access to safe drinking water. However, many communities are exposed to high fluoride levels in groundwater, leading to fluorosis. In this Collection, Rojanaworar et al. investigate the prevalence of dental fluorosis within agricultural communities in Thailand exposed to high levels of natural fluoride in groundwater used for household consumption. The researchers demonstrate that the occurrence of dental fluorosis among children exposed to fluoride concentrations in water sources greater than the WHO guideline value of 1.5mg/L is 1.62 times greater than those with drinking water containing the recommended concentration. This research highlights the need for access to safe drinking water in these areas. Furthermore, the Collection features an article by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01754-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rosário et al</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. that describes significant variability of fluoride concentrations in the water from treatment stations in Brazilian cities. Importantly, the group finds that over half of the public water supplies analysed had fluoride concentration levels outside the acceptable range, affecting the Brazilian population&#8217;s risk of developing oral diseases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Articles within the Collection also support </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #8</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to &#8220;promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth&#8221;.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-mangroves-inland-coast-ecosystem-yucatan-peninsula">How these sea-loving mangroves ended up far from the coast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 200 kilometers from the sea, red mangroves thrive in the rainforests along the San Pedro Mártir River on the Yucatán Peninsula. But how did these tangled trees that typically grow in salty water along coasts end up trapped so far inland and in freshwater?</p>



<p>Carlos Burelo has been mulling a version of that question ever since he visited the river on a fishing trip with his father 35 years ago. As a kid, he saw how the mangroves with their twisted aboveground roots were different from other trees, an observation that stuck with him into adulthood as a biologist at the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco in Villahermosa, Mexico.</p>



<p>Now, genetic analyses, surveys of vegetation and sediments and simulations of shifts in sea levels show that the red mangroves (<em>Rhizophora mangle)</em> are part of a “relict ecosystem” that has existed for more than 100,000 years. When warming during the last interglacial period, which peaked about 130,000 years ago, raised sea levels approximately 9 meters above present-day levels, the lowlands of what’s now the Yucatán Peninsula flooded. As a result, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/41/e2024518118">the mangrove forest was displaced and started to grow inland</a> by today’s standards, Burelo and colleagues report in the Oct. 12 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. When sea levels dropped as the world cooled again, the trees were left far from the coast.  </p>



<p>“The remarkable resilience of these trees, in particular, is striking — that although they’re normally adapted to seawater, they&#8217;ve survived all this time inland is incredible,” says Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb who wasn’t involved in the new study.<em></em></p>





<p>To estimate where the mangroves may have been displaced from, the team collected leaves from the trees and from other mangrove forests along the coasts of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and compared the plants’ DNA. That work pinpointed the origins of the inland mangroves about 170 kilometers away along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>



<p>By comparing the number of DNA mutations in the inland population with the other mangroves and by estimating the ages of the trees using tree cores, “we were able to infer [that the San Pedro mangroves] have been isolated for 120,000 years,” says Felipe Zapata, an evolutionary biologist at UCLA. The calcium-rich water and riverbed of the San Pedro has buttressed the survival of these red mangroves&nbsp;over the years, Zapata says.</p>

That calcium has helped the trees survive much farther inland than where mangroves typically grow, researchers say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104941">Ben Meissner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to the mangroves, the team found various plant species in the inland area that also have a coastal heritage. More than 30 percent, or 112 species, of the total flora growing along the river, including orchids and legumes, are typically found in coastal lagoons or along shorelines, the researchers say.</p>



<p>With those findings in hand, the researchers decided to look at the soil too. The team expected to find “coastal sediments, ocean sediments and perhaps ocean fossils,” says Exequiel Ezcurra, an ecologist at the University of California, Riverside. A geologic survey of sediments near the mangroves revealed “exactly what we expected,” he says, including coastal gravels, shells of marine gastropods, clay sediments rich in shell fragments, coastal dunes and large oyster shells.</p>



<p>Those finds, along with simulations of past sea levels, confirm that at some point during the last interglacial period, the ocean must have merged with the lower basin of the San Pedro River, pushing the red mangroves and other coastal species inland, the researchers conclude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discovering this relict ecosystem highlights the widespread impact past changes in the climate have had on the world’s coastlines, Ezcurra says, and it provides a chance to better understand how future sea level rise may affect these ecosystems.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Research into first impressions is a well-established area. Hundreds of studies have been published with the goal of understanding how the subtleties of facial features cue assumptions about those we meet. Often, the stimuli used are tightly controlled, with some sets using faces whose features are digitally manipulated to be larger or smaller by tiny degrees; the effect of miniscule alterations to the wideness of eyes, for example, can be isolated and analysed without changing any other aspect of the face. By eliminating as many extraneous variables as possible, research teams hope to get a reading of exactly what specific features contribute to the first impressions we form.</p>



<p>While on the surface this sounds like a reasonable and solid scientific approach, it does tend to create one pressing problem in particular. If you’ve ever participated in or run a study using face stimuli, it’s likely that the faces used were exclusively White.</p>



<p>Authors typically give no explicit reasoning for this choice within their published work. Richard Cook of Birkbeck, University of London and Harriet Over of the University of York believe that there are four broad reasons for this common decision. In their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34567592/">recent paper</a> in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, the two deconstruct the assumptions behind possible reasonings, and examine the limitations imposed on the field by avoiding non-White face stimuli.</p>



<span id="more-44197"></span>



<p><strong>A Confounding Factor?</strong></p>



<p>One of the concerns researchers may have about including non-White faces is that participants will infer traits of face stimuli based on just on ethnicity, regardless of the actual features of the face presented.</p>



<p>While it’s understandable to seek to limit the effects of racial bias when using face stimuli, the authors argue that this particular concern doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. In the lab, slight alterations in facial structure of Black face stimuli have been shown to affect the responses of White participants, suggesting that White viewers can form first impressions of Black faces based on features. Many studies also illustrate that participants do not apply blanket judgements to faces belonging to a particular group. For example, in a policing and judicial context, Black people with facial features that look more “stereotypically Black” (a term used centrally in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01716.x">original 2006 paper</a>) have been found to receive harsher sentencing decisions than those who do not.</p>



<p><strong>The Other-Race Effect</strong></p>



<p>Another concern for many researchers is the fallout of the Other Race Effect, in which some people have issues discerning between faces of those from races different to their own. It is often assumed that participants may lack the necessary perceptual expertise to process these faces, so datasets containing “other race” faces may not produce meaningful results.</p>



<p>However, the authors point out that the Other Race Effect produces relatively mild face processing deficits compared to face processing disorders such as prosopagnosia; even then, people with prosopagnosia nevertheless make judgements of facial traits typical of those without the condition. This concern also fails to consider the diverse environments in which people are raised. In many cities, locals are likely to have grown up with exposure to individuals from a large number of races. And of course, many people have family members of a different race. This leads the authors to believe that the Other Race Effect poses little practical concern, which is a view that seems to be supported by inconsistencies in racial exclusion criteria between many first impression studies — some studies allow non-White participants to assess White face sets, whereas others exclude non-White participants.</p>



<p>In addition, many face stimuli sets are computer generated — at times obviously so. This leads the authors of this paper to pose the question: “Given that synthetic faces with which participants have little or no perceptual experience can be valuable stimuli, then why not faces of colour?”</p>



<p><strong>Overshadowing Subtle Effects</strong></p>



<p>When inserting non-White faces into sets of White faces, it is possible that race would become a very salient factor, and so researchers may be concerned that participants will attend to race above all else, ignoring subtle changes in features.</p>



<p>The authors of this paper, however, argue that this is not necessarily something to shy away from. To the contrary, they assert that this is a key part of what the field of first impressions seeks to understand. Perceived ethnicity is an influential social cue — if we accept that first impressions based on ethnicity is quantitatively similar to other types of first impression (eg. based on sex or age), then it makes sense that this is a variable that we should seek to investigate, rather than exclude. Many studies already use interleaved male and female faces, and if ethnicity exerts a comparable level of effect, the authors emphasise there should also be few issues with interleaving diverse faces in research studies.</p>



<p>If studies require the ethnicity of face stimuli to be controlled, the authors suggest that this can also be achieved while including non-White faces. For example, all Black or all Asian face stimuli sets would be as effective at removing the influence of race as an all-White set.</p>



<p><strong>The Logistics of Using Diverse Face Stimuli</strong></p>



<p>In years gone by there were relatively few diverse face stimuli sets for researchers to choose from. Due to the effort involved in creating new stimuli sets, researchers looking to include non-White faces were faced with the prospect of spending hours perfecting their own set. For many, the impracticality was too much, and the readily available all-White sets were often chosen.</p>



<p>This, however, is changing. These days, there are several readily available diverse face sets, and the authors also note that computer generated sets allow for non-White faces to be generated. Even so, it appears that this option is rarely used within research — likely for the reasons discussed above. With these concerns addressed, however, hopefully that feature will see more use.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In recent years, psychologists have increasingly recognised the problems of studying only people from WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) backgrounds. Broadening stimuli to more resemble the real world, including widening investigations to assess first impressions across all races, is an important piece of this puzzle. Beyond being just a tick-box exercise, there is the potential to unearth findings that have substantial real-world impact; for example, understanding the types of faces that receive the harshest first impressions could help combat bias in everything from university applications to court judgements. And, though this paper focuses on research into first impressions, this isn’t the only topic that uses face stimuli. There are many other areas of psychology that make use of face stimuli whose validity may be hindered by not using stimuli sets that reflect the diversity of the real world. Without diverse data, we can’t know for sure.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we are beginning to see progress on this issue, and there have been some promising steps in the right direction in recent years. For instance, there have been replication attempts of studies focusing on dominance and trustworthiness in facial features, re-run with stimuli comprising equal numbers of Black, White, Asian, and Latin faces. Going forward, the authors believe that this amount of diversity should be routinely used. And, where researchers do not include diverse stimuli, explicit statements of reasoning behind this would be useful.</p>



<p>Perhaps most centrally to this argument, it is important that research into faces move past this so as not to imply that White is the default. In generations before us, this was very much the commonly held view. But in 2021, we are moving beyond that, and our stimuli need to make that journey too.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34567592/">Why is the literature on first impressions so focused on White faces?</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-lidar-mexican-pyramid-maya-teotihuacan-temple-feathered-serpent-tikal">Lasers reveal construction inspired by ancient Mexican pyramids in Maya ruins</a></h4>

              
                <p>At Teotihuacan, near Mexico City, three giant pyramids rise above the ancient city’s main street, the Avenue of the Dead. The smallest of these is the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, which sits within La Ciudadela, or the Citadel, a massive sunken plaza with tall walls.</p>



<p>Now, more than a thousand kilometers away at the Maya capital of Tikal in what’s now Guatemala, researchers have found a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/teotihuacan-complex-at-the-classic-maya-city-of-tikal-guatemala/1ABD72745DB20D55493B1A47CF267E77">smaller plaza and pyramid</a> possibly modeled after La Ciudadela and its temple.</p>



<p>Teotihuacan is thought to have conquered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">Tikal in the year 378</a> (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>)<em>.</em> The finding adds to evidence of Teotihuacan’s influence over Tikal, the team reports September 28 in <em>Antiquity.</em></p>



<p>“The architectural layout revealed by this study is stunning,” says anthropological archaeologist Nawa Sugiyama of the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new research. “The very orthogonal city planning with specific orientation of the pyramids gives Teotihuacan a very characteristic architectural style, making it easy to identify any Teotihuacan influence abroad.”</p>





<p>What’s more, the newfound structures had six construction phases, the researchers say, most dating to a time in Mesoamerica that archaeologists call the Early Classic period, which lasted from about 300 to 550. That means that the Tikal complex possibly predates the Teotihuacan conquest of the Maya city in 378. If true, that would add more evidence to an idea that scientists have worked on for decades — that these civilizations were in contact much earlier than the conquest of Tikal, possibly trading and making political connections with one another.</p>



<p>To uncover the pre-Columbian architecture, archaeologist Stephen Houston of Brown University in Providence, R.I., and colleagues at the Proyecto Arqueológico del Sur de Tikal along with the Pacunam LiDAR Initiative and the University of Texas at Austin used an airborne remote-sensing technique called lidar, or light detection and ranging.</p>

<p>“We knew this area in Guatemala was important to Teotihuacan culture,” says study coauthor David Stuart, director of the Mesoamerica Center of the University of Texas at Austin. But the place where the Citadel-inspired construction is located did not appear on old maps of the Tikal archaeological site because it is covered in vegetation. “As there was no visible stonework there, it was thought to be a natural hill,” Stuart says.</p>



<p>The team decided to look closer because the mound looked unusual for a Maya site. “Since the location was adjacent to an area in Tikal where many Teotihuacan-style artifacts were found in the 1980s, we thought it deserved more attention,” Stuart says. After reviewing the lidar mapping, Houston saw that the general plan of the buildings resembled the Ciudadela and its temple at Teotihuacan.</p>



<p>In her 2004 book <em>The</em> <em>Ancient Maya: New Perspectives</em>, Louisiana State University archaeologist Heather McKillop noted that the abundant presence of Teotihuacan-style architecture and pottery found in Tikal and a number of Maya sites across Guatemala is extensive evidence of the Teotihuacan influence across Mesoamerica from the year 400 to 700. The ancient city in Mexico thrived from about 100 to 750, but much about the people who lived there and why the city was destroyed and abandoned is still a mystery. The Aztecs gave the name Teotihuacanto the city centuries after its collapse.</p>



<p>“It is almost like Teotihuacan had installed their own neighborhood or embassy in Tikal,” says study coauthor and archaeologist Thomas Garrison, also at the University of Texas at Austin. Other research led by Sugiyama shows that “there was also a more permanent Maya presence in Teotihuacan before the conquest of Tikal as well, so influence probably went in both ways.”</p>



<p>Sugiyama studies the <a href="http://ppcteotihuacan.org/en/home/">Plaza of the Columns Complex</a> at Teotihuacan, where researchers have found Maya ceramics and evidence of Maya-style painted walls. “These murals were destroyed … before the 378 arrival event,” she says. “That makes us wonder whether the conquest [of Tikal] was one of the last chapters” in a long history of contact between the Mayas and the Teotihuacanos.</p>



<p>Eduardo Natalino dos Santos, a Mesoamerica historian at the University of São Paulo who did not take part in the study, agrees with Sugiyama. “The circulation of these ancient architectural styles show that the Mesoamerican Indigenous elites were connected. We used to see traces of one culture in a different region always as a result of a colonizing or domination process. Maybe this is not always the case,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskless-elephants-evolution-poaching">Tuskless elephants became common as an evolutionary response to poachers</a></h4>

              
                <p>When ivory poachers target elephants, the hunters can affect more than just animal numbers. In Mozambique, past hunting pressure led to an increase of naturally tuskless elephants in one park, a study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Mozambican Civil War, which lasted from 1977 to 1992, armies hunted elephants and other wildlife for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ecologists-restore-war-wrecked-ecosystem-mozambique">food and ivory</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 5/5/19</em>). This caused the number of large herbivores to drop more than 90 percent in the country’s Gorongosa National Park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, video footage and photographic records show that as elephant numbers plummeted, the proportion of tuskless female African savanna elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) rose from about 18 percent to 51 percent.</p>



<p>Decades of poaching appear to have made <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe7389">tusklessness more advantageous from an evolution standpoint</a> in Gorongosa, encouraging the proliferation of tuskless females with mutations in two tooth genes, researchers report in the Oct. 22 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The rapid culling of tusked individuals changed the makeup of traits in the elephant population in only two decades, leaving behind more tuskless individuals, say evolutionary biologist Shane Campbell-Staton of Princeton University and colleagues. The tuskless trait is heritable, and the evolutionary change in the population may stick around for several generations at least, even as poaching eases.</p>



<p>The team also analyzed the genetic instruction books of 18 tusked and tuskless females, zeroing in on two genes rife with mutations in tuskless females. In humans, the disruption of one of those genes can cause tooth brittleness and the absence of a pair of upper incisors that are the “anatomical equivalent of tusks,” Campbell-Staton says. Abnormalities in the other gene’s protein product can cause malformations of the tooth root and tooth loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poaching “changing the course of evolution” in Gorongosa’s elephants, Campbell-Staton says, can have reverberating effects through the ecosystem given elephants’ dramatic impact on their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Tusks are] not just ornamental. They serve a purpose,” he says, detailing how elephants use tusks to dig for water and strip tree bark for food. “If an elephant doesn&#8217;t have the tool to do those things, then what happens?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-sauropods-herds-nest-mussaurus">Some dinosaurs may have lived in herds as early as 193 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A treasure trove of fossilized eggs, nests and skeletons represents the earliest evidence yet of dinosaurs traveling in herds, a study finds.</p>



<p>The newly unearthed egg clutches were found alongside the skeletal remains of dozens of newborn, juvenile and adult dinosaurs, suggesting the creatures stayed together throughout their lives. At about 193 million years old, the finds displace<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99176-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the previous oldest evidence of herd behavior</a> in dinosaurs by at least 40 million years, researchers report October 21 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>In southern Argentina, paleontologist Diego Pol of the Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio in Trelew, Argentina, and colleagues found 80 individuals and over 100 eggs, all of the early sauropod ancestor <em>Mussaurus patagonicus</em>. Nests consisted of eight to 30 eggs, and analyses of five nests revealed that in each, the eggs were arranged in two or three layers within shallow trenches. Analyses of some skeletons revealed a diverse array of ages: At least 11 were hatchlings less than a year old, two were adults and nine were juveniles.</p>

<p>Fossils of the first known dinosaurs, including sauropodomorphs — relatively diminutive ancestors of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-largest-dinosaur-discovered">long-necked behemoth sauropods such as <em>Dreadnoughtus schrani</em></a> — date to around 245 million years ago (<em>SN: 9/4/14</em>). By the end of the Triassic Period, about 201 million years ago, sauropodomorphs, including <em>Mussaurus</em>, had become among the most abundant plant eaters on land. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-sauropod-went-walking-four-legs-two-it-grew"><em>Mussaurus</em> roamed</a> in what&#8217;s now Patagonia&#8217;s deserts (<em>SN: 5/20/19</em>). The dinosaurs built the newly unearthed nests when the area was semi-arid, near a&nbsp;lake that may have periodically flooded and evaporated. A sudden flood may explain the dinosaurs’ demise.</p>



<p>Mind-bogglingly massive sauropods didn’t arise until the Jurassic Period, which followed the Triassic. But fossils of Triassic sauropodomorphs like <em>Mussaurus</em> were already showing evidence of a growth spurt. The increased energy demands of larger bodies, the researchers suggest, may have required these creatures to coordinate their efforts, forming herds to forage across long distances.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite much work to counter unequal workforces in science, technology, engineering and maths, stereotypes about who will succeed in science <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">still abound</a> — and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-22579-003">some research</a> suggests that these biases can actively put people off certain careers or fields. Other papers find that the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">competitive nature</a> of STEM courses and roles can be particularly damaging, leading to low feelings of belonging and subsequent low retention rates for minority groups.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211033748">new paper</a> looks at the role of men in countering hostile environments — in particular, how men can signal their support and respect for women colleagues. Over three studies, the University of Kansas team found that supportive male allies helped reduce feelings of isolation and hostility for their women colleagues, potentially offering a new way to combat inequality in STEM.</p>



<span id="more-44163"></span>



<p>In the first study, 241 White women were told to imagine they had recently received a job offer at a chemistry company. Participants were randomly assigned to four conditions: in each, they saw a slideshow of their future co-workers. In two conditions all co-workers were male, while in the other they were gender-balanced. Within those groups, some participants were also assigned to the “ally condition”, in which one of the male co-workers expressed support for gender equality, while in the “no-ally condition”, none of the men mentioned gender equality. After viewing this slideshow, participants indicated how much they felt they would be isolated at the new company and how much they felt their co-workers would support and empower them. </p>



<p>Women without allies in workplaces with unequal gender compositions anticipated feeling significantly more isolation, though for those in gender-balanced contexts the presence of an ally didn’t make a difference to anticipated isolation. Participants in the all-men workforce with no ally also anticipated significantly less support from co-workers compared to those who had either been exposed to an ally or those in a more gender-balanced workforce. Having an ally in an unbalanced workforce, therefore, was as powerful at reducing feelings of isolation as having a gender-balanced group of colleagues.</p>



<p>The second study looked at the impact of allyship specifically on women of colour, with Black and White women participants recruited to take part. The procedure from the first study was employed again — only this time, the randomly assigned allies were either Black or White men, and all participants saw workforces in which women were underrepresented. After viewing the slideshow, participants completed the same measures as before, as well as indicating how much they anticipated hostility in the workplace and how much respect and equality they expected to encounter.</p>



<p>Those who were assigned an ally indicated that they expected to receive more respect and support in the workforce, would be less isolated, and would experience less hostility. There was no difference in results between Black and White women and the race of the male ally was also non-significant, suggesting that allies of all races can have an impact on women’s feelings of safety and inclusion at work. However, all workforces had 50/50 representation in terms of race; this could have mitigated any potential effects of the race of allies.</p>



<p>In a third and final study, participants saw allies who were either men or women. As well as completing the previous measures, participants also indicated how much they felt gender equality was the norm in the new workplace and how much they expected to fit in with their colleagues. Participants with either a male and female ally had significantly higher expectations of respect than those without. Interestingly, however, male allies outflanked female allies in other areas — participants expected gender equality to be the norm when a male ally was present but not a female ally, were more likely to feel they fit in and feel less isolated, and believed they would receive more support. They were also more likely to feel the workplace was not going to be hostile.</p>



<p>Though the results do seem to offer some hope — and a potential strategy for tackling unbalanced and stereotypically &#8220;male&#8221; environments — there are some limitations to the work. Firstly, the study only gave insights into women’s <em>anticipated</em> responses to allies, rather than looking at how it can help women when they are already in a workplace. Furthermore, looking at how allyship affects women in actually hostile environments versus generally gender equal ones could provide more detail on its impact (and its limits). The team also points to sincerity as a potentially mitigating factor — what happens to this gendered effect when men <em>say</em> they are dedicated to gender equality but don’t follow through, or if they exhibit other forms of hostility related to race, class or sexuality?</p>



<p>Despite limitations and lingering questions, however, the study does offer some tangible action that men could (and should) be taking in the workplace. Though such a strategy is obviously unlikely to completely reduce gender inequality, creating supportive, respectful and just working environments could go some way to make STEM a more equal place to be.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">Scientists found modern domestic horses’ homeland in southwestern Russia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much of human history was made astride, or beside, a horse. The animal’s stolid speed and strength powered massive migrations of people, pulled plows that transformed agriculture and revolutionized warfare. Now, researchers have pinpointed where and when horse and human history became intertwined.</p>



<p>Ancient DNA reveals that the modern domestic horse originated on the vast landscape of what is now southwestern Russia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04018-9">more than 4,200 years ago</a>, researchers report October 20 in <em>Nature</em>. In just a few centuries, these horses’ descendants spread quickly across Eurasia, supplanting almost all previous wild horse populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypotheses abounded for where modern horses were domesticated, ranging from Iberia to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-wild-horses-arent-truly-wild">modern-day Kazakhstan</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/18</em>), says Ludovic Orlando, ​​a molecular archeologist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France. “It’s been debated and debated and debated,” he says, “but there was nothing like a smoking gun.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orlando and colleagues analyzed ancient DNA from 273 horse bone specimens from across the continents, spanning 50,000 years of human and equine history. For most of that time, genetically varied wild horse populations were scattered across Eurasia. But starting around 2000 B.C., that variation vanished. By 1500–1000 B.C., domestic horses from Spain to Mongolia all descended from the same population, which the researchers traced back to more than 4,200-year-old specimens dug up on the Pontic-Caspian steppe, north of the Caucasus region and the Caspian Sea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two genes were distinctly different in these modern horse progenitors and may have aided this rapid expansion, the researchers found. In studies of humans and mice, those genes influence endurance, weight-bearing ability and docility. Selective breeding by humans could have “recombined two really good factors not [previously] present in any horse,” Orlando says. “That created an animal that was both easier to interact and move with.”</p>



<p>Humans may have tamed horses before, but it wasn’t until this point that our relationship with horses really took off, he says. “This is the moment in history horses made history.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vikings-north-america-date-newfoundland">Vikings lived in North America by at least the year 1021</a></h4>

              
                <p>Vikings inhabited North America exactly 1,000 years ago, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Counting tree rings reveals that wooden objects previously found at an archaeological site on Newfoundland’s northern peninsula were made from trees felled in the year 1021. That’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03972-8">the oldest precise date for Europeans</a> in the Americas and the only one from before Christopher Columbus’ voyages in 1492, geoscientists Margot Kuitems and Michael Dee and colleagues report October 20 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Researchers have assumed that Norse Vikings built and lived at the site, called L’Anse aux Meadows, roughly 1,000 years ago. But earlier attempts to more precisely date the settlement, which included three dwellings and other structures made of timber and turf and <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/4/">is now a UNESCO historic site</a>, were inconclusive. Evidence of a possible <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/possible-second-viking-site-found-newfoundland">second Viking settlement in Newfoundland</a> from around 1,000 years ago remains preliminary (<em>SN: 4/1/16</em>).</p>







<p>The new study focused on four wooden objects found at L’Anse aux Meadows, which was first excavated in the 1960s. It’s not clear how the objects were used, but each had been cut with metal tools. On three of the finds, Kuitems and Dee, both of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and their team identified an annual tree growth ring that displayed a signature spike in radiocarbon levels. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2783">Other researchers have dated that spike to the year 993</a>, when a surge of cosmic rays from solar activity bombarded Earth and increased the planet’s atmospheric levels of radioactive carbon.</p>



<p>Counting growth rings out to the edge of each wooden object starting at the year 993 ring yielded the same age — 1021.</p>



<p>Despite its precision, that date leaves unanswered when Vikings first set foot in the Americas. L’Anse aux Meadows might have been part of Vinland, a region in what’s now eastern Canada that is described in 13th century Icelandic texts as having been settled by Vikings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-why-ducklings-swim-row-behind-mother-duck-waves-energy">Here’s the physics of why ducklings swim in a row behind their mother</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s physics to having your ducklings in a row.</p>



<p>By paddling in an orderly line behind their mother, baby ducks can take a ride on the waves in her wake. That boost <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/waveriding-and-wavepassing-by-ducklings-in-formation-swimming/94759A0FF7070D9D7CAC5907594B1781">saves the ducklings energy</a>, researchers report in the Dec. 10 issue of the <em>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</em>.</p>



<p>Earlier measurements of duckling metabolism showed that the youngsters saved energy when swimming behind a leader, but the physics behind that savings wasn’t known. Using computer simulations of waterfowl waves, naval architect Zhiming Yuan of the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, and colleagues calculated that a duckling cruising in just the right spot behind its mother gets an assist.</p>



<p>When a duckling swims on its own, it kicks up waves in its wake, using up some energy that would otherwise send it surging ahead. That wave drag resists the duckling’s motion. But ducklings in the sweet spot experience 158 percent less wave drag than when swimming alone, the researchers calculated, meaning the duckling gets a push instead.</p>



<p>Like good siblings, the ducklings share with one another. Each duckling in the line passes along waves to those behind, so the whole brood gets a free ride.</p>



<p>But to reap the benefits, the youngsters need to keep up with their mom. If they fall out of position, swimming gets harder. &nbsp;That’s fair punishment for ducklings that dawdle.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Have you ever felt a little anxious or low, and decided that a beer or a glass of wine would help? If so, you’re hardly alone. This exact thought process must play across the country every night of the week. There’s been surprisingly little solid research, though, into whether alcohol does actually relieve these negative feelings. Now <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-87930-007">new work</a> led by Andrea M Wycoff at the University of Missouri-Columbia, US, concludes that in fact, it does not — and that people who &#8220;drink to cope&#8221; can even make their symptoms worse.</p>



<span id="more-44156"></span>



<p>The study involved 110 participants; 58 were from the general community and 52 had a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. People with BPD are known to be more prone to drinking problems, and to experience more variable emotions; they are even more likely than the rest of us, then, to view alcohol as a way to manage negative emotions. Some of the BPD participants had in fact been diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder. The team chose to include this group to try to capture as much variability in emotional states and proneness to problem drinking as possible in their study.</p>



<p>After completing various questionnaires in the lab, each participant was given an electronic diary. Every day for the next three weeks, they received regular prompts to report on any alcohol consumption, and also to rate levels of various negative feelings, such as being jittery, nervous, downhearted and lonely.</p>



<p>Whenever a participant reported having had an alcoholic drink, they were asked to rate the extent to which whether they’d done this to make them “feel less guilty or depressed” or “feel more relaxed and calm”. At various points over the following three hours, they then rated the extent to which they felt the drink had “relieved unpleasant feelings or symptoms”, and also provided updated ratings of their levels of those various negative feelings.</p>



<p>The team found some clear links between the various self-reports. When a participant had indicated that they were drinking to cope with anxiety or to cope with both anxiety and depression, they were more likely afterwards to report feeling that those unpleasant feelings had been relieved. This seemed to support the concept of drinking to cope, and, indeed, it led the researchers to expect that, for these people, their levels levels of various anxiety and/or depression-related feelings would drop after a drink.</p>



<p>But in fact the team did not find this pattern. Alcohol had no impact on anxiety scores. And when a participant reported that they were drinking to cope with depression, their depression-related feelings actually <em>increased</em> afterwards. For those participants diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, the increases were even more striking.</p>



<p>What might explain the discrepancy between the participants’ belief that the alcohol had helped on the one hand, and their own contradictory self-report score data, on the other? The researchers suggest that if someone expects alcohol to help, this could encourage them to believe that it has — even if their actual feelings have not changed, or even worsened.</p>



<p>People who &#8220;drink to cope&#8221; are more likely to develop problem drinking. And yet these new findings suggest that the very concept of drinking to cope is a fallacy — at least, in relation to the anxiety and depression-related measures used in this work. </p>



<p>The team concedes various limitations to the study, mostly to do with factors affecting generalisability. The over-representation of women among the participants (as well as the fact that a large proportion were diagnosed with BPD) certainly means that the results are not necessarily applicable to the general population. However, with regard to gender, earlier research suggests that men are more prone to report drinking to cope, and to have alcohol problems. So if more men had been included, it’s possible that the links would have been even stronger, which the researchers say future research should explore.</p>



<p>For now, though, if the idea that alcohol helps to relieve feelings of anxiety and depression is mistaken, then helping people to appreciate this might also help them turn to other strategies known to help, and not to harm — such as physical exercise. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">Here’s what we know about booster shots for Moderna’s and J&J’s COVID-19 vaccines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millions of people who got Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccines will soon be lining up for another dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 20, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a third dose of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine for select groups. The groups include people age 65 and older as well as 18- to 64-year-olds who have underlying conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, or who live or work in conditions that put them at high risk of exposure or complications from falling ill. The agency also authorized a second dose of the J&amp;J one-shot vaccine for everyone who got that jab.&nbsp;And FDA said the additional shots could come from any of the authorized or approved vaccines in a mix-and-match strategy.</p>



<p>On October 21, an advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also gave the thumbs up for boosters for people in those groups. Soon after, CDC director Rochelle Walensky gave the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1021-covid-booster.html">official OK</a>,  paving the way for Moderna and J&amp;J shot recipients to join the millions more who received Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and became <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-who-gets-booster-shots-vaccines-pfizer-fda">eligible for boosters in September</a> (<em>SN: 9/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>These shots may be especially important for older people whose immune systems have weakened with age, and for those with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of serious complications of the disease. While the vaccines greatly reduce the chance of being hospitalized and dying, there are some chinks in the armor that still leave millions of such people vulnerable to the disease. Fully vaccinated people can get COVID-19 and die from it, though at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colin Powell, a former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GenPowell">died October 18 of complications of COVID-19</a> even though he was fully vaccinated, his family said in a statement posted on Facebook. Powell, 84, had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that erodes immune defenses against infections. Booster shots may help rev up the immune systems of such vulnerable people, perhaps providing enough protection to stave off the disease’s worst complications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for healthy people, the vaccines’ effectiveness appears to be dipping. For instance, people in a clinical trial who got Moderna’s vaccine from August through December 2020 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhlshZ7Lkr0">had a 36 percent to 40 percent higher chance of a breakthrough infection</a> than those vaccinated in January through April this year, Jacqueline Miller, therapeutic area head for infectious diseases at Moderna,&nbsp;said at a meeting of the FDA advisory panel considering Moderna’s booster.&nbsp;That panel endorsed both the Moderna and J&amp;J booster during meetings held October 14 and 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, experts emphasize that getting shots to unvaccinated people, not boosters to the vaccinated, will make the biggest difference in controlling the pandemic. “People who are in the ICU aren’t there because they haven’t gotten a third dose; they haven’t gotten any dose,” Paul Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said at the October 14 advisory panel meeting. What’s more, he added, it may not be reasonable to expect the vaccines to prevent infections and mild illnesses. “That is a high bar to which we hold no other vaccines.”</p>



<p>Here are answers to five common questions about booster shots.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Is Moderna’s jab really becoming less effective over time?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Like the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is holding strong against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preventing such severe complications of COVID-19 is the vaccines’s most important role, Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said at the October 14 meeting. But when evaluating the value of a booster shot, officials should also take into account complications such as blood clots or long COVID that might result from mild to moderate disease, he said.</p>



<p>Moderna’s shot was still 95.8 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3916094">97.9 percent effective at preventing deaths</a>, researchers reported September 4 in a preprint in the <em>Lancet.</em> But efficacy against any COVID symptoms was only about 88 percent, while its effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was 72.7 percent, the researchers found. That’s a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2106599">decline from about 96 percent effectiveness against symptomatic disease</a> and around 90 percent effectiveness against asymptomatic infections among health care workers vaccinated from December 28, 2020, through May 19, 2021, researchers reported September 22 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Concerns about waning immunity prompted the FDA panel to give the thumbs-up for vulnerable groups to get a third dose of the vaccine.</p>



<p>In an earlier study, it had appeared as if Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm">slipping against the coronavirus, particularly the delta variant</a>, while Moderna’s vaccine was maintaining its protection levels, researchers reported September 17 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Some researchers speculate that the difference could stem from the Moderna vaccine having much higher doses — 100 micrograms of mRNA per dose compared with Pfizer’s 30 micrograms — that could produce higher levels of antibodies that would take longer to dip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the result might also have been an artifact of geography, says David Dowdy, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. During the study period, delta was surging in the South where more people got the Pfizer vaccine than the Moderna vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine has been most widely used in the Midwest, where delta wasn’t as bad at the time of the study, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People want to believe that the main driver of vaccine effectiveness is the immune response,” Dowdy says. “It certainly matters, but it’s also important how much you’re getting exposed to this virus.… The more exposure people see, the less effective these vaccines are going to appear to be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, naturally waning immunity and the rise of more infectious coronavirus variants along with social factors, such as relaxed masking and social distancing regulations, will also bite into the Moderna vaccine’s effectiveness, he says. “The same forces that are causing lower immunity over time for Pfizer are also acting on Moderna.”</p>



<p>The antibodies sparked by Moderna’s vaccine <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2115596">certainly wane in the eight months after the first dose</a>, researchers reported October 15 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Those declining antibody levels hint that people may be becoming more susceptible to infection. But, so far, it’s still difficult to directly link antibody levels in the blood to how well people are protected against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And antibodies aren’t the only tool our immune systems have to fight off disease. Immune cells called T cells, which can coordinate the immune response to an infection or kill off infected cells, appear to remain in the body at stable levels at least eight months after vaccination. So even if vaccinated people get infected, the immune system can quickly rally the troops and protect people from severe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What about Johnson &amp; Johnson’s shot — is it becoming less effective?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Clinical trial data suggest that the effectiveness of the J&amp;J shot, made by the company’s pharmaceutical division Janssen, isn’t waning overall, company representatives said at the October 15 advisory panel meeting. Compared with the mRNA vaccines, antibody levels after a J&amp;J shot increase over time rather than decrease, researchers reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> study. What’s more, the amount of T cells remains steady over a period of eight months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While immune defenses prompted by the vaccine are steadfast, the coronavirus has found ways to evade protection from vaccine antibodies. When it was authorized in February, the J&amp;J vaccine was about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization">85 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations</a>, and about 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe disease (<em>SN: 2/27/21</em>). But the rise of viral variants has changed that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In countries where the delta variant is dominant, like the United States, the shot is still more than 70 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms. That number dips to around 50 percent in South America, where there are coronavirus variants that can evade parts of the immune system, including gamma, lambda and mu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s more, some real-world data hint that the shot might not be as effective as clinical trials suggest, the FDA’s Marks noted at the meeting. Starting about a month after a dose of the vaccine, the single shot was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm">68 percent effective at preventing hospitalization</a>, researchers reported in the Sept. 17 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. The study included adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19 at some point from March 11, 2021 through August 15, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, regardless of whether or not immunity wanes over time, the protection that the one shot offers against severe disease or against milder infections is not equal to the mRNA vaccines, Cohn said. But a booster dose can help, which is why the FDA panel voted to make boosters available to everyone who got that shot. A second dose given two months after the first can boost protection to even higher levels, on par with Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA jabs. In a U.S.-based clinical trial, the J&amp;J booster dose had 94 percent efficacy at preventing COVID-19 symptoms. Global efficacy is lower, at 75 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as I’m concerned, it was always going to be necessary for J&amp;J recipients to get a second shot,” said James Hildreth, an immunologist and president and CEO of Meharry Medical College in Nashville. A single dose of the vaccine might be used in some situations, he said, such as to top up the immune responses of people who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">previously had COVID-19 </a>(<em>SN: 8/19/21</em>).</p>



<h4>Will the side effects after a booster dose be worse?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>In clinical trials, side effects of a Moderna booster were no worse than, and sometimes milder than, the effects seen after the second shot. Arm pain, some redness and swelling were worse for some participants, but those effects were short-lived. Most of the other side effects, including fever, chills, headaches and nausea were reported by fewer participants and were milder than after the second shot. Similarly, recipients of a second dose of J&amp;J’s shot reported side effects on par with or milder than the reaction to the first shot.</p>



<p>There were no reports in the companies’ clinical trials of myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, that is an uncommon, but potentially serious side effect of all three vaccines, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis">particularly in young men</a> (<em>SN: 6/23/21</em>). Such heart problems have been more prevalent with the mRNA vaccines. But the studies contain too few people to uncover rare side effects.</p>



<p>Some real-world data from Israel’s experience with the Pfizer booster suggests that the rate of myocarditis after a booster may be lower than after the second shot, said Sharon Alroy-Preis, Israel’s director of Public Health Services. A study of more than 5 million Israelis found that about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730">40 out of every million vaccinated males&nbsp; </a>develop myocarditis, especially after the second shot, researchers reported October 6 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. But only 17 of the more than 2.5 million people ages 16 to 59 who got a booster developed myocarditis or pericarditis, inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, Israeli officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lower rate of the complication after a booster shot may be because the third dose came months after the first two, giving the immune system time to adjust and not overreact to another shot of vaccine, Alroy-Preis said.</p>



<p>Some studies found that the Moderna vaccine carried a slightly higher risk of the heart problems than Pfizer’s does. Other studies didn’t show discrepancies. In the United States, the highest rate reported for the inflammatory conditions was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-10-20-21/11-COVID-Dooling-508.pdf">39 cases per million doses of mRNA vaccine</a> given to 18- to 24-year-old males, the CDC’s Kathleen Dooling said October 21 during a presentation at the advisory panel meeting.</p>



<p>Worries over the heart complications had prompted several members of the FDA advisory committee to withhold support for giving booster shots to people younger than 65. But others on that panel had pointed out that the risk of young people developing heart inflammation from COVID-19 are much greater than the risk of the vaccine causing the side effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The J&amp;J vaccine has other risks, including a blood clots accompanied by reduced platelet counts. That condition, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, happens most often in females ages 30 to 39, with about 10 cases for every million J&amp;J doses given, Dooling said. As of October 13, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-10-20-21/09-COVID-Talbot-508.pdf">47 cases of the rare clotting disorder</a> have occurred out of the 15.3 million doses given.&nbsp; Of those 47 cases, five were fatal.</p>



<p>J&amp;J’s vaccine also has a risk of a rare neurological disorder called Guillain Barré syndrome. Through July 24, 130 cases of the disorder have been reported after getting a J&amp;J shot. The condition is most often seen in males ages 50 to 64. In that group, the condition was reported at a rate of 16 cases per million J&amp;J doses.</p>



<p>Blood clots are also common among people with COVID-19, and Guillain Barré syndrome is a possible complication of the disease as well.</p>





<h4>Should I stick with the same vaccine brand that I got before?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The FDA gave the green light to allow people to get any of the three authorized vaccines as a booster. That decision <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/18/covid-booster-shots-mix-and-match/?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_news_alert_revere&amp;location=alert&amp;wpmk=1&amp;wpisrc=al_news__alert-hse--alert-national&amp;pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJjb29raWVuYW1lIjoid3BfY3J0aWQiLCJpc3MiOiJDYXJ0YSIsImNvb2tpZXZhbHVlIjoiNTk2Y2FiNjZhZGU0ZTI0MTE5ZDQwYzQ4IiwidGFnIjoid3BfbmV3c19hbGVydF9yZXZlcmUiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vaGVhbHRoLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvY292aWQtYm9vc3Rlci1zaG90cy1taXgtYW5kLW1hdGNoLz91dG1fc291cmNlPWFsZXJ0JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXdwX25ld3NfYWxlcnRfcmV2ZXJlJmxvY2F0aW9uPWFsZXJ0JndwbWs9MSZ3cGlzcmM9YWxfbmV3c19fYWxlcnQtaHNlLS1hbGVydC1uYXRpb25hbCJ9.z1hF2hIjNfZplSMocYwrg4jOEwK1I86dfZ2ntHCrkCs">gives health officials the flexibility to administer different shots</a>, if necessary, the <em>Washington Post</em> reported October 19.</p>



<p>Some people are already getting boosters from a different manufacturer than the source of their original vaccination, says Julie Swann, a health systems and pandemic modeler at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “With Pfizer, you can go off-label since it is fully approved” by the FDA, she says. But vaccine providers probably need to wait for an official nod to mix and match with the Moderna and J&amp;J vaccines, which are still under emergency use authorization.</p>



<p>Preliminary clinical trial data suggest that mixing and matching different vaccines is just as good, or better, than receiving the same vaccine for all doses. That trial, led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-variant-immunity">analyzing the immune responses</a> of more than 450 vaccinated people who originally received either two doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s shot or one dose of J&amp;J’s (<em>SN: 6/11/21</em>). The researchers divided the participants into one of nine groups. Some groups received another dose of the same jab — like, for example, a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. Other participants got a shot from a different developer — such as two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine followed by J&amp;J’s.</p>



<p>Getting an additional dose of any kind <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v1">boosted antibody levels across the board</a>, researchers reported October 13 at medRxiv.org. When people received the same shot as before, antibodies that stop the virus from infecting cells increased compared to before the booster dose. But for some groups, a mixed regimen gave a bigger antibody boost than sticking with the original brand. That was particularly true for people who had originally received J&amp;J’s shot, which triggers the body to produce fewer antibodies than mRNA vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those results mirror a recent mix-and-match trial of Pfizer’s vaccine with one from AstraZeneca, which is similar to the J&amp;J shot. The AstraZeneca vaccine is used in many countries around the world, but is not authorized in the United States.&nbsp; In that study, people who got an AstraZeneca jab made <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2821%2901694-9">higher levels of antibodies if their follow-up dose came from Pfizer</a>. Pfizer recipients made more antibodies when sticking with a second mRNA dose than from switching to AstraZeneca, researchers reported August 6 in <em>Lancet</em>. That study didn’t measure T cells or other types of immunity, though.</p>



<p>The results are promising, but there’s still lots to learn, Kirsten Lyke, a vaccinologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore who is involved with the NIAID study, said at the October 15 meeting. She and her colleagues plan to look at T cells, too, not just antibodies. What’s more, it’s possible that some combinations of the vaccines might spark immunity that lasts longer than others. For now, though, it’s impossible to say whether one regimen might be better than another. Lyke and her team are following participants for at least a year to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the CDC advisory panel members said at the <a href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/VWBXKBR8af4">October 21 meeting</a> that they would encourage people who got J&amp;J’s jab to strongly consider getting an mRNA vaccine as their second shot. But people should be mindful of the risk of myocarditis for some people, panelists cautioned.</p>



<h4>Are people going to need more booster shots in the future?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>No one knows. But that question was on the mind of many FDA panelists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael Kurilla, an immunologist at the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in Bethesda, Md., noted that the rationale for mRNA boosters is that antibody levels in the blood are waning and over time vaccinated people become susceptible to infection. At the meeting, Kurilla wanted to know if there is any evidence to suggest that a booster dose might provide longer-lived protection than the first two doses.</p>



<p>That’s the “1-million-dollar question that I don’t have the answer to,” Israel’s Alroy-Preis responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alroy-Preis attended the October 14 meeting to provide an update on whether boosters for Pfizer’s mRNA jab were helping control the virus in Israel. Officials there began rolling out the shots to older people at the end of July and to all eligible age groups at the end of August. So far, booster shots are <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1">curbing severe cases of the disease</a>, as well as infections, in all age groups shortly after the shot is administered, Alroy-Preis and colleagues reported in a preliminary study posted October 7 at medRxiv.org.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s possible that the months between the original shots and the booster might help immunity last longer. But it’s still unknown when is the best time for people to receive each shot.</p>



<p>Data presented at the meeting from Moderna’s clinical trial, for instance, suggest that a third shot gives people with lower antibody levels a larger boost than people who still have lots of antibodies in their blood. Most people with fewer coronavirus-attacking antibodies had been vaccinated earlier, in 2020, a sign that it’s better to wait longer between doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shots also protect people from disease even when researchers can’t detect antibodies in the body, Kurilla said. That means other parts of the immune system, like T cells, are helping out. But it’s still far from clear whether mRNA vaccines will offer long-term immunity. And if they don’t, it could be either because protection from these types of vaccines simply isn’t long-lived or because people aren’t getting doses at the right time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, the question is what do we want the boosters to do, Kurilla noted. The jabs don’t appear to stop infection itself for very long, but are good against severe disease. “We can’t look at this as boost people every six months,” Kurilla said. Experts, however, seem to be more open to the idea of an annual shot, like for the flu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gecko-india-jackie-chan-western-ghats-mountains">An agile gecko found in India named after the legendary Jackie Chan</a></h4>

              
                <p>Martial arts legend Jackie Chan may not be aware of this yet but some of his biggest fans are a group of adoring herpetologists from India. These scientists have named a newly identified gecko species, the Jackie’s day gecko (<em>Cnemaspis jackieii)</em>, after Chan.</p>



<p>This lizard is <a href="http://www.zoores.ac.cn/en/article/doi/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.074">one of 12 new gecko species</a> found in India that researchers describe September 23 in <em>Zoological Research</em>. All 12 species are endemic to the Western Ghats, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-starry-dwarf-frog-species-no-close-relatives">biodiversity-rich mountain range</a> threatened by deforestation and changing land use (<em>SN: 3/18/19</em>).<em></em></p>



<p>Working at mid-elevation in the Western Ghats, the team noticed an extremely agile gecko. “Whenever we attempted to catch it, it would spring from one rock to the other, and crawl into the smallest of crevices to escape us,” says Saunak Pal of the Bombay Natural History Society in Mumbai. Immediately, it reminded the researchers of the nimble-footed Chan, spurring them to name it after the martial artist.</p>



<p>“Naming a species in this manner helps people connect with it especially when it is a less popular class of animals like reptiles,” says coauthor Zeeshan Mirza of the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore. Mirza has identified nearly 60 new faunal species to date, including the now world-famous snake Salazar’s pit viper (<em>Trimeresurus salazar),</em> named after Salazar Slytherin, a character in the Harry Potter series.</p>



<p>Unique skin patterns inspired names for some of the other newly described gecko species. The golden-crowned day gecko (<em>C. regalis</em>), or royal day gecko, earned its regal name from the golden-yellow head of the male of this species.</p>

<p>Another with body coloration that bears an uncanny resemblance to a galaxy of stars led the team to name it the galaxy day gecko (<em>C. galaxia)</em>. The clouded forest gecko (<em>C. nimbus)</em> has a prominent cloudlike pattern on the upper side and flank of the male of the species.</p>



<p>Mirza hopes the catchy names will draw attention that “will help in conserving these species as well as the landscape.”</p>

                <p></p>



<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>However you like to take time for yourself, from reading to hiking to playing video games, leisure time can be a vital way of relaxing, promoting good mental and physical health, boosting social relationships, and inducing happiness. But whether we fully experience those benefits, a new study suggests, may depend on the way we view leisure time itself.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/as/authorization.oauth2?platSite=SD%2Fscience&amp;scope=openid%20email%20profile%20els_auth_info%20els_idp_info%20els_sa_discover%20urn%3Acom%3Aelsevier%3Aidp%3Apolicy%3Aproduct%3Ainst_assoc&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fuser%2Fidentity%2Flanding&amp;authType=SINGLE_SIGN_IN&amp;prompt=login&amp;client_id=SDFE-v3&amp;state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3D7af23fda-c01d-4b86-9f8d-a3d4707bf0ee%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS0022103121001013%26prompt%3Dlogin%26cid%3Darp-dc8fac54-2469-4c74-afbe-b88bca2d495b">study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>, explores how the enjoyment of leisure time changes when or if we think of that time as ‘wasteful’. It not only finds that people who believe leisure time is unproductive find it less enjoyable, but also that these beliefs are associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.</p>



<span id="more-44135"></span>



<p>For the first study, the team recruited 302 participants who had recently celebrated Halloween. These participants first indicated what they had done for the holiday, including going to a party, going to a bar, going to a haunted house, taking kids trick or treating, or something else. All of the events were either instrumental (a means to an end, such as taking children trick or treating to fulfill a parental responsibility) or terminal (something done for its own end or for pleasure).</p>



<p>Participants then indicated how much they had enjoyed these activities and how much they agreed with five statements assessing whether time spent on leisure activities is wasted or unproductive. And those who had engaged in <em>terminal</em> leisure activities (like going to a party) indicated overall that they were less likely to enjoy those activities if they believed that leisure is wasteful.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first, only this time with more general activities (e.g. spending time with friends, watching TV, meditating); these participants also completed measures of happiness, depression, anxiety, and stress. Again, a belief that leisure is wasteful was associated with significantly reduced enjoyment of activities done for their own end, but not of activities done to fulfil a particular purpose. Those holding these negative beliefs also reported lower levels of happiness and higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, suggesting that such beliefs may negatively impact wellbeing (though we can’t make any conclusions here about cause and effect).</p>



<p>In a third study, participants were put into one of four conditions, with all reading a mocked-up <em>New York Times</em> article. Depending on the condition, the article described leisure as wasteful, unproductive, or productive; those in the final condition read an unrelated article about coffee makers. Participants then watched a funny cat video, before rating how much they enjoyed the video and completing measures on positive and negative affect.</p>



<p>Reflecting results from the previous studies, those who were primed to believe leisure is wasteful and unproductive were less likely to enjoy watching the video than those who read that it was productive and those who were in the control condition. And while there were no significant effects on negative affect, positive affect was lower in the wasteful and unproductive conditions compared to the productive and control conditions. A final study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>Overall, the study suggests that viewing leisure as wasteful or unproductive can significantly impact not only our enjoyment of downtime but actively counteract the positive effects of such time on our wellbeing. Future research could also look at how beliefs about leisure time affect people’s behaviour. Do people who find leisure time less enjoyable engage in fewer recreational activities, or does it simply change the types of activity they pursue?</p>



<p>And while priming people to believe leisure is &#8220;productive&#8221; mitigated the negative emotional effects, more work could be done to explore interventions that are more oriented towards enjoyment. Leisure time, after all, should be a place to detach from goal setting, growth and other markers of productivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-school-works-coronavirus-pandemic-reopening">COVID-19 testing in schools works. So why aren’t more doing it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In August 2020, the school superintendent in Omaha, Neb., approached a microbiology lab at the local university’s medical center. School districts across the country were starting to design pilot programs for routine COVID-19 testing in the coming fall semester, and Omaha Public Schools wanted to join the trend.</p>



<p>The result? During Omaha’s pilot of frequent, asymptomatic testing, the rate of cases detected in the school testing program was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784428">six times as high</a> as the case rate reported by traditional testing for symptomatic students only. The pilot program detected 70 cases per 1,000 students, compared with 12 per 1,000 in the official tally reported by the local public health department, researchers report September 22 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>“Asymptomatic screening dramatically increases case detection among students and staff in the K through 12 setting,” says M. Jana Broadhurst, a microbiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who led the team that designed and implemented pilot programs for the school district. In other words, regular testing of all students and staff will catch far more COVID-19 cases than simply testing those who demonstrate COVID-19 symptoms or have a known exposure to the virus. Catching those cases is crucial to nipping outbreaks in the bud and keeping kids in school and healthy.</p>

<p>But this fall, Omaha Public Schools does not have a COVID-19 testing program at all. Why? “The absence of public health guidance on how to utilize and act upon those test results,” Broadhurst says.</p>



<p>Omaha isn’t alone. Throughout the United States, numerous K–12 schools have struggled to implement routine COVID-19 testing, despite expansive funding from the federal government and a recent surge in cases, fueled by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta variant</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). This surge has taken a huge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-kids-5-11-safe-works-infection">toll on children</a>, demonstrating for many experts the need for deploying testing as a safety measure (<em>SN: 9/20/21</em>). Many school districts have seen <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/few-masks-sick-kids-packed-ers-how-one-districts-first-four-weeks-of-school-went-bad">more cases among students</a> — and more shut-down classrooms — in fall of 2021 than they did last fall, before vaccines were widely available.</p>



<p>But major hurdles to testing include a lack of clear guidance on how testing programs should work, obtaining tests, gaining consent from parents and communicating the value of testing to families and staff in increasingly polarized environments.</p>



<h3>Putting testing to the test</h3>



<p>In the last year, both real-world testing pilots like Omaha’s and simulations of different testing scenarios have shown that by routinely testing students and staff, school leaders can identify cases and quickly pull infected people out of the classroom, preventing widespread outbreaks.</p>



<p>“Testing has been widely used at institutions ranging from colleges and universities to the NBA,” says Alyssa Bilinski, a biostatistician at Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I. Testing programs “find people who are currently infectious and isolate them so they don&#8217;t spread COVID-19 further.”</p>



<p>At the same time, Bilinski says, testing can provide school leaders with valuable insight into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">coronavirus transmission in the classroom</a> — information that can inform decisions about increasing or pulling back on other safety measures (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Routine testing really has the potential to greatly reduce within-school COVID-19 transmission, and in some cases, even completely eliminate it,” agrees Divya Vohra, an epidemiologist at Mathematica, a research organization with headquarters in Princeton, N.J., who studies testing pilot programs. “We think that it really is a very powerful tool when you layer it on top of all of the other mitigation strategies that schools are implementing, like masking and distancing.”</p>

<h3>Testing strategies</h3>



<p>According to computer simulations, routine COVID-19 testing may reduce in-school virus transmission by up to 100 percent. In the left scenario, the community around this school is facing high case rates (200 cases per 100,000 residents in the last week), while in the right scenario, the community is facing low case rates (25 cases per 100,000 residents). Pooled testing, in which an entire classroom is PCR-tested at once, is the most successful at reducing transmission. Serial antigen testing (antigen tests two days in a row) is more successful than single antigen testing if community cases are high. All scenarios assume that 100 percent of students and staff at the school participate in testing.</p>

<p>Some testing strategies <a href="https://www.mathematica.org/publications/implementing-covid-19-routine-testing-in-k-12-schools-lessons-and-recommendations-from-pilot-sites">can reduce in-school coronavirus transmission by 100 percent</a>, Vohra and colleagues reported July 26 in a study posted on Mathematica’s website. Pool testing, a method in which samples from an entire classroom are combined and PCR-tested together, is particularly effective at cutting down on transmission when case numbers in the community around the school are high, the models of testing scenarios suggest. This testing method is highly accurate, because PCR tests identify coronavirus DNA in samples, and it provides results more quickly than if each student’s test was processed one by one.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re more likely to catch an infection that an antigen test might miss,” Vohra says. Antigen tests detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus; they provide results in just 15 minutes and are easy to administer in a school setting. While these tests are less accurate than PCR tests, they are almost as capable of reducing transmission when used once a week or more, especially when community transmission is lower, Vohra says.&nbsp;Testing is most effective when all students and staff are routinely swabbed, but programs may still identify cases when just a subset of the school population is included.</p>



<h3>Start-up challenges</h3>



<p>Despite the value of routine COVID-19 testing in schools, any school administrator aiming to test their students faces numerous challenges. Setting up such a program is “like taking the whole entire school on a field trip to somewhere that nobody&#8217;s ever been,” says Leah Perkinson, a lead coordinator of K–12 testing pilot programs run by New York City–based nonprofit Rockefeller Foundation.</p>



<p>The first test, she says, is the most difficult. To make that test happen, school leaders have numerous decisions to make. They have to determine which testing strategy to use — PCR or pooled PCR or antigen; nasal swabs or saliva tests — and then procure enough of those tests for hundreds of students and staff. They need to determine who will conduct the tests, when and where testing will occur, how to report test results and how to collect consent from students’ parents and guardians. And, crucially, school officials need to determine what will happen when a test result is positive: Who needs to quarantine and for how long?</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Many of these decisions are, in essence, public health decisions — yet school leaders are not trained in public health. As a result, schools need “coordination and support coming from experts, particularly at the state and federal level” to set up routine testing, Vohra says.</p>



<p>Like numerous other aspects of the pandemic, coordination and support for school testing varies greatly across states. Some, including <a href="https://coronavirus.utah.gov/education">Utah</a>, <a href="https://www.doe.k12.de.us/Page/4242">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://covid.ri.gov/testing/testing-k-12-students-and-staff">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/school-testing/">California</a>, have taken advantage of funding from this <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html">past spring’s federal stimulus package</a> to buy tests for their public school districts and provide guidelines on how those tests should be used. But in other places, state-level leaders have refused funding entirely, leaving school districts on their own.</p>



<p>At the federal level, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that schools set up regular COVID-19 testing but offers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html#anchor_1625662107144">very limited guidance on specifics</a>. Instead, the agency recommends that school leaders coordinate with their local public health departments.</p>



<p>To fill in the testing information gap for school leaders that lack state guidance, the National Institutes of Health, the Rockefeller Foundation and others have created detailed online resources that let school and public health leaders compare testing strategies and connect with test providers. Still, Perkinson says, these resources may be challenging for school administrators to find and use because the information is “not all in one centralized place.”</p>



<h3>Quarantine queries</h3>



<p>Another major challenge that routine school testing programs face, Vohra says, is determining what happens when a student or staff member tests positive. “If you&#8217;re identifying more cases, then that&#8217;s going to mean that more students are going to be isolating or quarantining,” she says.</p>



<p>Some schools have adjusted their quarantine policies to minimize the number of students missing out on in-person learning. Instead of quarantining an entire classroom, for example, a school may require only those students who sit within six feet of an infected student to quarantine. Policies may also differ for students who are and are not vaccinated. And there is no right answer when it comes to the best strategy, Vohra says.</p>



<p>To help local leaders understand different test and quarantine combinations, Vohra and colleagues <a href="https://covid-school-testing.mathematica.org/start">built a dashboard</a> based on the results from their modeling study. Users can plug in their testing goals, quarantine policies, community transmission rates and more; the tool offers comparisons of how well different testing strategies fare in reaching those goals.</p>



<p>Another strategy — one not included in the dashboard — is called “test to stay.” Instead of requiring quarantines for students who are exposed to the coronavirus, officials may require those students to get tested at a higher frequency, such as one test a day for a week. A study of secondary schools in the United Kingdom shows that schools where close-contact students were tested daily had similar success in identifying and isolating COVID-19 cases as schools where contacts were all required to isolate immediately. In other words, the “test-to-stay” <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01908-5/fulltext">strategy saved in-person school days while still catching cases</a>, the researchers report September 14 in the <em>Lancet</em>.</p>



<p>In Utah, public schools are required by state law to conduct a <a href="https://coronavirus-download.utah.gov/School/Test_to_Stay.pdf">“test-to-stay event”</a> when they face an outbreak. In these events, schools host mass testing days; all students must test negative to continue attending classes. A pilot version of the program <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-school-testing-kids-safe">saved over 100,000 days of in-person instruction</a> for about 60,000 students, according to a CDC report published in May 2021 (<em>SN: 8/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>This fall, the program has been implemented statewide but is facing new challenges, says Maggie Graul, an epidemiologist with Utah’s state public health department who manages the program.</p>



<p>The state defines a school outbreak as 2 percent of the student body in large schools or 30 students in small schools testing positive within two weeks — a slightly higher threshold than was used in the pilot program. Schools, public health departments and other local institutions that support “test-to-stay events” are often hesitant to set up mass testing until they hit that outbreak threshold, as they may face community pushback for testing before it is required, Graul says. As a result, she says, the school outbreaks “are actually larger, and we&#8217;re not able to contain them as well as last year” during the pilot program.</p>



<h3>Opt in versus opt out</h3>



<p>A routine school testing program is most effective when all students and staff participate. If testing is voluntary, the families who opt in are likely to be the same families who also follow other COVID-19 precautions, such as wearing masks in public spaces. But schools that institute these programs have struggled with everything from collecting easy-to-misplace consent forms from students to gaining consent in the first place from some parents.</p>



<p>The Rockefeller Foundation’s pilot programs found that, even when families and school staff expressed support for testing in the abstract, it was much harder to get people onboard for a specific testing regimen. For instance, staff opt-in rates at the foundation’s six pilot sites ranged from 25 percent in Tulsa, Okla., to 100 percent in Los Angeles.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Real-world testing</h3>



<p>Five schools in Los Angeles took part in a pilot COVID-19 testing program. From late March to late May, the schools all together administered over 200 tests a week — peaking at almost 2,000 tests a week in late April. During this time, the overall test positivity rate in these schools (0.01 percent) was much lower than the positivity rate for Los Angeles County (ranging between 0.5 percent and 1 percent). This indicates that coronavirus transmission was lower in the schools that regularly tested their students and staff than in the wider community. (No tests were administered during the week of April 9 during spring break.)</p>

<p>To increase the share of students who get tested, some schools use an opt-out strategy. Rather than students needing a consent form to get tested, they’re automatically enrolled in testing and need a permission form to get out of the program. Baltimore has used this strategy, Perkinson says. New York City also piloted an opt-out strategy in the 2020–2021 school year, requiring all students who attended class in-person to participate in weekly random testing — essentially a participation rate of 100 percent. In fall 2021, however, testing has become opt-in instead of opt-out. <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/less-quarter-nyc-public-school-kids-have-opted-covid-19-testing-school">Fewer than a quarter of students</a> had opted in as of October 6.</p>



<p>In parts of the country where COVID-19 safety measures in schools have become intensely political, convincing people to opt in can be challenging. Fall 2021 has seen numerous parent protests over these measures — ranging from angry crowds at school PTA meetings to individual families pulling their children out of public schools.</p>



<p>Routine testing programs have not faced the same degree of scrutiny as mask mandates or vaccination requirements. But “testing has been politicized as much as every other aspect of the response to this pandemic,” Broadhurst says. Some of Rockefeller’s pilot programs faced some “families and community members who didn&#8217;t really see the value of testing and didn&#8217;t really think that schools should be in the business of testing,” Vohra says.</p>



<p>It’s not just politics, either. “Testing can&#8217;t happen in a vacuum,” Broadhurst says. If a student tests positive, not only is this student out of school for two weeks, but also a whole family may be out of work in order to quarantine and care for that child, losing crucial income. This creates tension between public health measures and economic security, Broadhurst says. Integrating testing programs with other services —such as free meals and a space to isolate — for socioeconomically vulnerable families may help them agree to participate in testing programs.</p>



<h3>Keeping an eye on the goal</h3>



<p>Despite the many challenges of routine testing, school leaders and researchers who work on K–12 COVID-19 testing programs are optimistic about this strategy’s potential in the current school year and beyond.</p>



<p>“This is public health; it is not public perfect,” Perkinson says. If a school is not able to meet an ideal testing benchmark for lowering transmission, every individual test is still a win, she says. Every positive result may identify a case before it turns into an outbreak.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/x_PwWlwCtec/">What a difference a data repository makes: Six ways depositing data maximizes the impact of your science</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Data is key to verification, replication, reuse, and enhanced understanding of research conclusions. When your data is in a repository&mdash;instead of an old hard drive, say, or even a Supporting Information file&mdash;its impact and its relevance are magnified. Here are six ways that putting your data in a public repository can help your research go further.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h2>1. You can&rsquo;t lose data that&rsquo;s in a public data repository</h2>



<p>Have you ever lost track of a dataset? Maybe you&rsquo;ve upgraded your computer or moved to a new institution. Maybe you deleted a file by mistake, or simply can&rsquo;t remember the name of the file you&rsquo;re looking for. No matter the cause, lost data can be embarrassing and time consuming. You&rsquo;re unable to supply requested information to journals during the submission process or to readers after publication. Future meta analyses or systematic reviews are impossible. And you may end up redoing experiments in order to move forward with your line of inquiry. With data securely deposited in a repository with a unique DOI for tracking, archival standards to prevent loss, and metadata and readme materials to make sure your data is used correctly, fulfilling journal requests or revisiting past work is easy.</p>



<h2>2. Public data repositories support understanding, reanalysis and reuse</h2>



<p>Transparently posting raw data to a public repository supports trustworthy, reproducible scientific research. Insight into the data and analysis gives readers a deeper understanding of published research articles. Offering the opportunity for others to interpret results demonstrates integrity and opens new avenues for discussion and collaboration. Machine-readable data formatting allows the work to be incorporated into future systematic reviews or meta analyses, expanding its usefulness.</p>



<h2>3. Public data repositories facilitate discovery</h2>



<p>Even the best data can&rsquo;t be used unless it can be found. Detailed metadata, database indexing, and bidirectional linking to and from related articles helps to make data in public repositories easily searchable&mdash;so that it reaches the readers who need it most, maximizing the impact and influence of the study as a whole.</p>



<h2>4. Public data repositories reflect the true value of data</h2>



<p>Data shouldn&rsquo;t be treated like an ancillary bi-product of a research article. Data <em>is research</em>. And researchers deserve academic credit for collecting, capturing and curating the data they generate through their work. Public repositories help to illustrate the true importance and lasting relevance of datasets by assigning them their own unique DOI, distinct from that of related research articles&mdash;so that datasets can accumulate citations in their own right.</p>



<h2>5. Public data demonstrates rigor</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to illustrate the rigor of your results than explaining exactly how you achieved them. Sharing data lets you demonstrate your credibility and inspires confidence in readers by contextualizing results and facilitating reproducibility.</p>



<h2>6. Research with data in public data repositories attracts more citations</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">2020 study</a> of more than 500,000 published research articles found articles that link to data in a public repository have a 25% higher citation rate on average than articles where data is available on request or as Supporting Information. The precise reasons for the association remain unclear. Are researchers who deposit carefully curated data in a repository also more likely to produce rigorous, citation-worthy research? Are researchers with the time and resources to devote to data curation and deposition more established in their careers, and therefore more highly cited? Are readers more likely to cite research when they trust that they can verify the conclusions with data? Perhaps some combination?&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-general-relativity-time-warp-millimeter-physics">An atomic clock measured how general relativity warps time across a millimeter</a></h4>

              
                <p>A millimeter might not seem like much. But even a distance that small can alter the flow of time.</p>



<p>According to Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">clocks tick faster</a> the farther they are from Earth or another massive object (<em>SN: 10/4/15</em>). Theoretically, that should hold true even for very small differences in the heights of clocks. Now an incredibly sensitive atomic clock has spotted that speedup across a millimeter-sized sample of atoms, revealing the effect over a smaller height difference than ever before. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12238">Time moved slightly faster</a> at the top of that sample than at the bottom, researchers report September 24 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“This is fantastic,” says theoretical physicist Marianna Safronova of the University of Delaware in Newark, who was not involved with the research. “I thought it would take much longer to get to this point.” The extreme precision of the atomic clock’s measurement suggests the potential to use the sensitive timepieces to test other fundamental concepts in physics.</p>



<p>An inherent property of atoms allows scientists to use them as timepieces.&nbsp; Atoms exist at different energy levels, and a specific frequency of light makes them jump from one level to another. That frequency — the rate of wiggling of the light’s waves — serves the same purpose as a clock’s regularly ticking second hand. For atoms farther from the ground, time runs faster, so a greater frequency of light will be needed to make the energy jump. Previously, scientists have measured this frequency shift, known as gravitational redshift, across a height difference of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/everything-really-relative">33 centimeters</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/10</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, physicist Jun Ye of JILA in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues used a clock made up of roughly 100,000 ultracold strontium atoms. Those atoms were arranged in a lattice, meaning that the atoms sat at a series of different heights as if standing on the rungs of a ladder. Mapping out how the frequency changed over those heights revealed a shift. After correcting for non-gravitational effects that could shift the frequency, the clock’s frequency changed by about a hundredth of a quadrillionth of a percent over a millimeter, just the amount expected according to general relativity.</p>

<p>What’s more, after taking data for about 90 hours, comparing the ticking of upper and lower sections of the clock, the scientists determined their technique could measure the relative ticking rates to a precision of 0.76 millionths of a trillionth of a percent. That makes it a record for the most precise frequency comparison ever performed.</p>



<p>In a related study, also submitted September 24 to arXiv.org, another team of researchers loaded strontium atoms into specific portions of a lattice to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12237">create six clocks in one</a>. “It’s very exciting what they did, as well,” Safronova says.</p>



<p>Shimon Kolkowitz of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and colleagues measured the relative ticking rates of two of the clocks, separated by about six millimeters, to a precision of 8.9 millionths of a trillionth of a percent, which itself would have been a new record had it not been beat by Ye’s group. With that sensitivity, scientists could detect a difference between two clocks ticking at a rate so slightly different that they’d disagree by just one second after about 300 billion years. Ye’s clock could detect an even smaller discrepancy between the two halves of the clock of one second amassed over roughly 4 trillion years. Although Kolkowitz’s team didn’t yet measure gravitational redshift, the setup could be used for that in the future.</p>

<p>Authors of both studies declined to comment, as the papers have not yet been through the peer-review process.</p>



<p>The measurements’ precision hints at future possibilities, says theoretical physicist Victor Flambaum of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. For example, “atomic clocks are now so precise that they may be used to search for dark matter,” he says. This stealthy, unidentified substance lurks invisibly in the cosmos; certain hypothesized types of dark matter could alter clocks’ tick-tocks. Scientists could also compare atomic clocks made of different isotopes — atoms with varied numbers of neutrons in their nuclei — which might hint at undiscovered new particles. And atomic clocks can study whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">fundamental constants</a> of nature might vary (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>The ability to precisely compare different clocks is also important for a major goal of timekeeping: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-new-measurement-time-redefining-second">updating the definition of a second</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>). The length of a second is currently defined using an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilogram-just-got-revamp-unit-time-might-be-next">earlier generation of atomic clocks</a> that are not as precise as newer ones like those used in the two new studies (<em>SN: 5/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>“There is a very bright future for the clocks,” Safronova says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Imagine that a neighbour asks for a favour — to help move some garden furniture at the weekend, say. Now imagine that, instead, they explain that they’d lined up a friend to help, but that friend has become ill, and you’ll only be required if they’re not better in time.</p>



<p>Rather than a firm favour, this second scenario involves what the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-52356-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</em> dub a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221;. And, Michael K. Zurn at the University of Cologne and colleagues report, we are more likely to agree to grant these favours than ones that we know for sure we’ll have to come good on. This might not be surprising in itself — but the team goes on to show that exploiting the “maybe favour” effect could have big implications for society.</p>

<p>In a preliminary study, 113 students were presented with various vignettes describing requests for help in moving furniture, either from a close friend or a stranger. The amount of helping time required varied from 10 minutes to an hour, and the likelihood that the participant would actually have to help — in the case of the original helper still being sick — was estimated at 99%, 50%, 10% or 1%. Unsurprisingly, the participants were more likely say they’d help a friend than a stranger. But offers of help to a stranger became more likely when the chance of being needed was low vs high – when, in other words, a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221; was requested.</p>



<p>For close friends, the team in fact found the opposite pattern. They suspect that if a close friend says that they <em>might</em> need help, this signals that their need isn’t really very high. But the participants’ greater willingness to grant a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221; to a stranger suggests that just showing this willingness brings the benefits that come from granting a favour, while reducing the expected costs. These benefits could involve simply feeling good about agreeing to help someone else out.</p>



<p>Of course, for every 100 granted and delivered &#8220;firm favours&#8221;, 100 &#8220;maybe favours&#8221; will not result in the same total number of good deeds. But, the team reasoned, <em>if </em>we are much more likely to agree to maybe favours than firm favours, this could result in more good deeds overall. So they explored this next.</p>



<p>In two studies on a total of more than 1,000 US residents, participants were offered a 20 cent payment for taking part. After they had read a description of the non-profit environmental organisation The Conservation Fund, half were asked if they wanted to donate their payment to this charity (granting the equivalent of a firm favour). The rest were asked if they wanted to donate their payment, but with the promise that 5% of these donations would be cancelled, and no donation would actually be made. This was the &#8220;maybe favour&#8221;.</p>



<p>In the first study, 31% of those in the definite-donation group donated their payment, while 47% of those in the maybe group did. Even though 5% of the donations from people in this second group were cancelled, this meant that the team donated a total of US$29.96 from them, but only US $20.60 from the definite-donation group. In a replication of this study, the percentages who agreed to donate were similar, though not quite as different, at 38% and 47%. Though the effect size was smaller this time, the absolute donations from the &#8220;maybe&#8221; group were still higher ($17.30 vs $15.80).</p>



<p>In further studies that also involved requests for small donations to charity, the team found that whether someone made a definite donation or a maybe-donation — or made a maybe-donation but learned that their donation had been cancelled — they got the same &#8220;feel good&#8221; feelings as a result. Importantly, then, adding a &#8220;maybe&#8221; to the donation didn’t affect the subjective benefits of granting it.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting one other statistic from the pooled study results: though only 5% of maybe-donators didn’t actually give away the money, donation rates on average were 18% higher for this group. This might also reflect a known cognitive bias: that we tend to overweight small probabilities (and underweight high probabilities). So, though the probability of having the donation revoked was small, it had an over-sized impact on decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, “our findings show that with a simple ‘maybe’ we can capitalise on fundamental biases of human cognition to get more good deeds done,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>In theory, introducing a &#8220;maybe&#8221; to a pledge might have a big net impact not just on the total value of charitable donations, say, but also blood or organ donations, or a willingness to help refugees, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Of course, these studies involved very small amounts of money that the participants didn’t possess in the first place. More work is needed to explore how this maybe effect might play out in the real world. But, the team concludes, “we think that in times where altruism and solidarity are needed more than ever, this simple intervention may be used to really get more good deeds done.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">5 cool things to know about NASA’s Lucy mission to the Trojan asteroids</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, a spacecraft is headed to Jupiter’s odd Trojan asteroids. What <a href="http://lucy.swri.edu/">Lucy</a> finds there could provide a fresh peek into the history of the solar system.</p>



<p>“Lucy will profoundly change our understanding of planetary evolution in our solar system,” Adriana Ocampo, a planetary scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said at a news briefing October 14.</p>



<p>The mission is set to launch from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., as early as October 16. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-sets-coverage-invites-public-to-virtually-join-lucy-launch">Live coverage</a> will air on NASA TV beginning at 5 a.m. EDT, in anticipation of a 5:34 a.m. blast off.</p>



<p>The Trojan asteroids are two groups of space rocks that are gravitationally trapped in the same orbit as Jupiter around the sun. One group of Trojans orbits ahead of Jupiter; the other follows the gas giant around the sun. Planetary scientists think the Trojans could have formed at different distances from the sun before getting mixed together in their current homes. The asteroids could also be some of the oldest and most pristine objects in the solar system.</p>





<p>The mission will mark several other firsts, from the types of objects it will visit to the way it powers its instruments. Here are five cool things to know about our first visit to the Trojans.</p>



<h4>1. The Trojan asteroids are a solar system time capsule.</h4>



<p>The Trojans occupy spots known as Lagrangian points, where the gravity from the sun and from Jupiter effectively cancel each other out. That means their orbits are stable for billions of years.</p>



<p>“They were probably placed in their orbits by the final gasp of the planet formation process,” the mission’s principal investigator Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., &nbsp;said September 28 in a news briefing.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean the asteroids are all alike. Scientists can tell from Earth that some Trojans are gray and some are red, indicating that they might have formed in different places before settling in their current orbits. Maybe the gray ones formed closer to the sun, and the red ones formed farther from the sun, Levison speculated.</p>



<p>Studying the Trojans’ similarities and differences can help planetary scientists tease out whether and when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">giant planets moved around</a> before settling into their present positions (<em>SN: 4/20/12</em>). “This is telling us something really fundamental about the formation of the solar system,” Levison said.</p>



<h4>2. The spacecraft will visit more individual objects than any other single spacecraft.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Lucy will visit eight asteroids, including their moons. Over its 12-year mission, it will visit one asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and seven Trojans, two of which are binary systems where a pair of asteroids orbit each other.</p>



<p>“We are going to be visiting the most asteroids ever with one mission,” planetary scientist Cathy Olkin, Lucy’s deputy principal investigator, said in the Oct. 14 briefing.</p>



<p>The spacecraft will observe the asteroids’ composition, shape, gravity and geology for clues to where they formed and how they got to the Lagrangian points.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s first destination, in April 2025, will be an asteroid in the main belt. Next, it will visit five asteroids in the group of Trojans that orbit the sun ahead of Jupiter: Eurybates and its satellite Queta in August 2027; Polymele in September 2027; Leucus in April 2028; and Orus in November 2028. Finally, the spacecraft will shift to Jupiter’s other side and visit the twin asteroids Patroclus and Menoetius in the trailing group of space rocks in March 2033.</p>



<p>The spacecraft won’t land on any of its targets, but it will swoop within 965 kilometers of their surfaces at speeds of 3 to 5 meters per second relative to the asteroids’ speed through space.</p>



<p>There’s no need to worry about collisions while zipping through these asteroid clusters, Levison said. Although there are about 7,000 known Trojans, they’re very far apart. “If you were standing on any one of our targets, you wouldn’t be able to tell you were part of the swarm,” he said.</p>

<h4>3. Lucy will have a weird flight path.</h4>



<p>In order to make so many stops, Lucy will need to take a complex path. First, the spacecraft will swoop past Earth twice to get a gravitational boost from our planet that will help propel it onward to its first asteroid.</p>



<p>The closest Earth flyby, in October 2022, will take it within 300 kilometers of the planet’s surface, closer than the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope and many satellites, Olkin said. Observers on Earth might even be able to see it. “I’m hoping to go near where it flies past and look up and see Lucy flying by a year from now,” she said.</p>



<p>Then in December 2030, after more than a year exploring the “leading” swarm of Trojans, Lucy will come back to the vicinity of Earth for one more boost. That final gravitational slingshot will send the spacecraft to the other side of the sun to visit the “trailing” swarm. This will make Lucy the first spacecraft ever to venture to the outer solar system and come back near Earth again.</p>



<h4>4. Lucy will travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered craft.</h4>



<p>Another record Lucy will break has to do with its power source: the sun. Lucy will run on solar power out to 850 million kilometers away from the sun, making it the farthest-flung solar powered spacecraft ever.</p>



<p>To accomplish that, Lucy has a pair of enormous solar arrays. Each 10-sided array is more than 7.3 meters across and includes about 4,000 solar cells per panel, Lucy project manager Donya Douglas-Bradshaw said in a news briefing on October 13. Standing on one end, Lucy and its solar panels would be as tall as a five-story building.</p>



<p>“It’s a very intricate, sophisticated design,” she said. The advantage of using solar power is that the team can adjust how much power the spacecraft needs based on how far from the sun it is.</p>





<h4>5. The inspiration for Lucy’s name is decidedly earthbound.</h4>



<p>NASA missions are often named for famous scientists, or with acronyms that describe what the mission will do. Lucy, on the other hand, is named after a fossil.</p>



<p>The idea that the Trojans hold secrets to the history of the solar system is part of how the mission got its unusual name. To understand, go back to 1974, when paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and a graduate student <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/human-evolution-origins-fossils-paleoanthropology">discovered a fossil of a human ancestor</a> who had lived 3.2 million years ago. After listening to the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” at camp that night, Johanson’s team named the fossil hominid “Lucy.” (In a poetic echo, the first asteroid the Lucy spacecraft will visit is named Donaldjohanson.)</p>



<p>Planetary scientists hope the study of the Trojans will revolutionize our understanding of the solar system’s history in the same way that studying Lucy’s fossil revolutionized our understanding of human history.</p>



<p>“We think these asteroids are fossils of solar system formation,” Levison said. So his team named the spacecraft after the fossil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spacecraft even carries a diamond in one of its instruments, to help split beams of light. Said planetary scientist Phil Christensen of Arizona State University in Tempe at the Oct. 14 briefing: “We truly are sending a diamond into the sky with Lucy.”</p>
