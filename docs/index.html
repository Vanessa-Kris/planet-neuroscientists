                Stolen data, “gross” misconduct, a strange game of scientific telephone,&#160;and accusations of intimidation – Santa came late to Retraction Watch but he delivered the goods in style.

                A Nature journal has retracted a 2021 paper which made a bold claim about certain chemical reactions after several researchers raised questions about the analysis – but not before another group pulled their own article which built on the flawed findings.&#160; The first article, “The amine-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura-type coupling of aryl halides and arylboronic acids,” appeared &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/28/highly-professional-but-the-process-seems-to-take-a-long-time-is-this-the-best-way-to-correct-the-record/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">‘Highly professional, but the process seems to take a long time’: Is this the best way to correct the record?</span></a>

                In September 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the Committee on Scientific Integrity (CSI) of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) advised the LUMC Board of Directors to ask for retraction of two publications because of major data manipulation in images.

                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 21 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a rundown of the most-read news stories and long reads of 2021.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<h5>1. Space station detectors found the source of weird ‘blue jet’ lightning</h5>



<p>Instruments on the International Space Station detected the origins of an odd type of lightning called a blue jet. The bizarre bolt is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-station-detectors-found-source-weird-blue-jet-lightning">sparked by a “blue bang”</a> — a flash of bright blue light that may be brought on by the turbulent mixing of oppositely charged regions within a thundercloud (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 14</em>).</p>





<h5>2. A newfound quasicrystal formed in the first atomic bomb test</h5>



<p>The first atomic bomb test, in 1945, forged a peculiar, glassy material called trinitite — and within it, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a>. Quasicrystals’ atoms are arranged in an orderly structure like normal crystals, but the structure’s pattern doesn’t repeat (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>).</p>



<h5>3. An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</h5>



<p>The Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines set the record for the highest known level of Denisovan ancestry — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">about 5 percent of their DNA comes from the ancient hominids</a>. The finding suggests that several Denisovan populations independently reached Southeast Asia and interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups that arrived thousands of years later (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</h5>



<p>In a first, astronomers caught a glimpse of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">a rare double cosmic cannibalism</a>: A star swallowed a black hole or neutron star, which then gobbled that star from within, resulting in an astonishing explosion (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Frog skin cells turned themselves into living machines</h5>



<p>Skin stem cells plucked from frog embryos organized themselves into miniature living robots, dubbed “xenobots,” that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">can swim, move around debris and even self-heal</a>. Xenobots may one day serve a useful purpose, but ethical questions need to be considered (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Favorite video</h3>



<p>Acrobatic rabbits bewitched online readers in our most-viewed YouTube video posted this year. The video — accompanying the story “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabbit-handstand-front-paws-gene-defect-video">A gene defect may make rabbits do handstands instead of hop</a>” (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 13</em>) — shows a sauteur d’Alfort rabbit walking on its front paws (below). Such hop-less bunnies may have adopted the odd gait because of a mutation in a gene called <em>RORB</em>, scientists discovered.</p>

<h4>Top feature stories</h4>



<h5>1. New drugs that block a brain chemical are game changers for some migraine sufferers</h5>



<p>A class of drugs that inhibits a neurotransmitter called calcitonin gene-related peptide is helping some patients who suffer from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migraine-headache-new-drugs-block-brain-chemical">chronic, debilitating migraines</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>2. Einstein’s theory of general relativity unveiled a dynamic and bizarre cosmos</h5>



<p>Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity has served as the bedrock of our understanding of the cosmos. In the last 100 years, scientists have confirmed its most radical predictions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">including black holes, gravitational waves and an expanding universe</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>3. Chemists are reimagining recycling to keep plastics out of landfills</h5>



<p>No matter people’s dedication to sorting and recycling plastics, most still end up in landfills because the materials are too difficult to transform into useful new products. Some chemists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">are trying to change that</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Psychology has struggled for a century to make sense of the mind</h5>



<p>In the last 100 years, psychologists and other social scientists have dug into the muddy “science of us” and developed conflicting theories about human thought and behavior. From the messy, contentious research bloomed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">insights into what makes humans tick</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Fossils and ancient DNA paint a vibrant picture of human origins</h5>



<p>From the Taung Child to Lucy, the last century of paleoanthropology has sketched a rough timeline of how humans came to be. Scientists now agree that human evolution has its roots in Africa, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">many mysteries in our history remain to be solved</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 20</em>).</p>

<h3>Fusion of the future</h3>



<p>Hopes for making nuclear fusion the clean energy source of the future got a boost in August when a fusion experiment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">released 1.3 million joules of energy</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 11</em>). A big hurdle for fusion energy has been achieving ignition — the point when a fusion reaction produces more energy than required to trigger it. The test released about 70 percent of the energy used to set off the reaction, the closest yet to the break-even milestone.</p>

<h3>Pig-to-human kidney transplant</h3>



<p>In a first, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">a pig kidney was attached to a human</a>, and the organ functioned normally during 54 hours of monitoring (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 6</em>). This successful surgical experiment marks a milestone toward true animal-to-human transplants, which would broaden the supply of lifesaving organs for people in need.</p>

<h3>Death stars</h3>



<p>In a bone-chilling event, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">astronomers caught a star swallowing a nearby black hole</a>, or perhaps a neutron star, and then getting eaten by its own meal. The resulting spectacular explosion left behind a black hole (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>). Astronomers had theorized that such a star-eat-star supernova was possible, but had never observed one.</p>

<h3>Living machines</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">Frog cells transformed themselves into tiny living robots</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>). Scientists removed skin stem cells from frog embryos and watched the cells organize into little blobs dubbed “xenobots” that could swim around and even repair themselves, plus move particles in the environment. Xenobots might someday serve a useful purpose, such as cleaning up waterways, the scientists say.</p>

<h3>Brain teaser</h3>



<p>Scientists got an entirely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-map-neurons-connections-google-harvard">new view of the brain</a> when they took a tiny piece of a woman’s brain and mapped the varied shapes of 50,000 cells and their 100 million or so connections (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 6</em>). The vast dataset may help unravel the complexities of the brain.</p>

<h3>Pluses are minuses</h3>



<p>People often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">add even when subtracting is the way to go</a>, scientists found after asking volunteers to tackle a variety of puzzles and problems, including stabilizing a Lego structure and optimizing a travel itinerary (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 8</em>). The tendency to think in pluses instead of minuses could be at the root of modern-­day excesses like cluttered homes, the researchers speculate.</p>

<h3>Potty training cows</h3>



<p>Can farmers reduce pollution by sending cows to the loo? The answer might very well be yes. In a unique experiment, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-cattle-pee-potty-training-bathroom-pollution-ammonia">trained cows to answer nature’s call</a> by using a bathroom stall that gathers urine (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 24</em>). In the future, collected cow urine, which could otherwise pollute the environment, might be used to make fertilizer.</p>

<h4>Crystal clear</h4>



<p>The intense heat and pressure of the first atomic bomb test, in 1945, left behind a glassy substance known as trinitite — and something even stranger. Within the trinitite, scientists discovered, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>). Quasicrystals have an orderly structure like a normal crystal, but that structure doesn’t repeat. Previously, these crystals had been found only in meteorites or made in the lab.</p>

<h3>Case of the missing genes</h3>



<p>A foul-smelling Southeast Asian plant named <em>Sapria himalayana </em>has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reeking-parasitic-sapria-plant-lost-body-much-genetic-code">lost about 44 percent of the genes found in most other flowering plants</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 13</em>). <em>S. himalayana</em> parasitizes other plants to get nutrients, so it’s not so surprising that it has entirely purged its chloroplast DNA. Chloroplasts are the structures where photosynthesis, or food making, typically occurs. <em>S. himalayana</em> appears to steal more than nutrients — more than 1 percent of its genes come from other plants, perhaps current or past hosts.</p>

<p>Identical twins may not be genetically identical, after all. They differ by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-identical-twins-dont-have-identical-dna-genetics">5.2 genetic changes on average</a>, researchers reported (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 15</em>). That means differences between such twins may not be solely due to environmental influences. In other DNA accounting, scientists estimated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-our-dna-is-uniquely-human">1.5 percent to 7 percent of modern human DNA</a> is uniquely human, distinct from the DNA of Neandertals, Denisovans and other ancient relatives (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 7</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">How some of 2021’s major science stories evolved over time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A story doesn’t necessarily end once it goes online. Here, <em>Science News</em> offers status updates on some evolving stories we reported on earlier this year.</p>



<h4>Tulsa massacre answers</h4>



<p>This year marked the 100th anniversary of a race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., in which a mob of white people invaded the prosperous Black neighborhood of Greenwood. The death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, though the exact number is unknown, as is the exact location where victims were buried. In May, Helen Thompson reported on a collaboration between scientists, historians and community leaders to investigate an area in Oaklawn Cemetery that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tulsa-1921-race-massacre-mass-grave-greenwood-archaeology-dna">may hold a mass grave of victims</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/21</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: In June, archaeologists announced they had found 34 coffins at Oaklawn and were analyzing remains from 19 of them. Preliminary findings suggest the remains belonged to children and adults, forensic anthropology lead Phoebe Stubblefield said June 25 at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=338768600964239">news conference</a>. Based on skull facial features, “ancestry so far when we can detect it has been primarily of African descent,” she said. One man had a bullet embedded in his shoulder, along with trauma consistent with expectations for the massacre’s victims, the project’s archaeology lead, Kary Stackelbeck, told <em>Science News</em> in November. The full analysis, expected to be released in early 2022, aims to determine the race, sex, age and any trauma patterns of all the recovered individuals. Those results will help determine the project’s next steps.</p>





<p>“This process has been a very sobering, very powerful experience,” Kavin Ross, chairman of the public oversight committee, said at the news conference. “We are so hopeful for more findings.”</p>





<h4>Finally, a malaria vaccine</h4>



<p>In June, Erin Garcia de Jesús reported that two malaria vaccine candidates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-vaccine-live-parasites-drugs-results-small-trial">showed promise in small clinical trials</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/21</em>). One jab — tested in children in Burkina Faso — had 77 percent efficacy against malaria symptoms. The other, tested in adults from the United States, had around 87 percent efficacy against infection when paired with infection-fighting drugs. The results sparked hope that the world’s first approved malaria vaccine would soon become a reality.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, it happened, but for a different vaccine. In October, <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk">the World Health Organization gave a thumbs up to a vaccine</a> that was further along in testing, approving it for children who live in sub-Saharan Africa and other places with the deadliest species of the malaria-causing parasite, <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. Of the estimated 409,000 people who died from malaria in 2019, two-thirds were under age 5. Although groundbreaking, the vaccine — called RTS,S or Mosquirix — is not a magic bullet. The four-dose regimen prevents only about 4 in 10 malaria cases and 3 in 10 severe cases. Still, RTS,S plus existing tools could “save tens of thousands of young lives each year,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an October 6 statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>GM mosquitoes hatch in Florida</h4>



<p>After about a decade of fierce debate, genetically modified mosquitoes flew free in the United States for the first time. Starting in April, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">modified eggs were deposited in several test spots</a> in the Florida Keys, Susan Milius reported (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Designed as living pesticides by the biotech company Oxitec, male GM <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes mate with local females of this hard-to-eradicate species and pass along a gene that kills daughters in the wild before they can bite. Sons grow up to trick more females into doomed mating. Eventually, the population of this spreader of dengue and Zika should dwindle.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: GM males that hatched from eggs succeed in wooing Floridian females, test watchers report. After two temporary stops for big storms, managers restarted periodic releases and kept tests running into November. In August, Oxitec asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to allow two more years of testing in the Keys. The company also asked to start testing in to “up to 84,600 total acres” in California, which identified its first <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito in 2013. Today, the pest is scattered throughout the state. In California, travelers account for all of the state’s dengue and Zika cases. But <em>Ae. aegypti</em> might someday spread these diseases within the state.</p>

<h4>Wildfire extinction threats</h4>



<p>In March, John Pickrell reported on how Australia’s wildlife was faring a year after the country’s devastating 2019–20 wildfires. Experts feared that more than 500 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">species may have become endangered</a> — and some even extinct (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>). While some of these species were charismatic marsupials such as the koala, many were plants and invertebrates that typically garner far less attention.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: A larger analysis published in July showed that <a href="https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/media/b2oi2hyc/8-3-1-assessment-of-the-impacts-of-the-2019-20-wildfires-of-southern-and-eastern-australia-on-invertebrate-species-final-report_v3.pdf">as many as 14,000 invertebrate species</a> had some part of their ranges badly burned by the fires. Jess Marsh, an arachnologist at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, says that researchers are formally adding 60 of about 240 invertebrate species that earlier in the year they suspected had become endangered to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List of Threatened Species</a>. But in a rare piece of good news, surveys in March and September turned up multiple individuals of two species that researchers had feared were extinct: the Kangaroo Island assassin spider (<em>Zephyrarchaea austini</em>) and Palethorpe’s pinwheel snail (<em>Rhophodon palethorpei</em>). Finding two assassin spiders that had managed to hang on in a tiny patch of unburnt habitat was “amazing,” Marsh says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                The American Heart Association has published a corrected version of a controversial meeting abstract which claimed to show that Covid-19 vaccinations “dramatically” increased a person’s risk for serious heart problems.&#160; The study was the work of Stephen Gundry, a cardiac surgeon who now sells dietary supplements of questionable efficacy on his website.

                <p>While a flurry of missions crowded around Mars this year, some lesser-explored parts of the solar system are about to get fresh eyes.</p>



<p>Three countries visited the Red Planet in 2021, sending orbiters, landers, rovers and even a helicopter. The United Arab Emirates successfully put <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">its first interplanetary spacecraft, called Hope</a>, into orbit in February, to study Mars’ climate. China’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">Zhurong rover</a> has been trundling around the planet’s surface since May, studying the local geology and searching for underground water ice (<em>SN Online: 5/19/21</em>). And NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover, which landed</a> in February, has been collaborating with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">a helicopter called Ingenuity</a> to explore an ancient lake bed and collect rocks for a future delivery mission to Earth (<em>SN Online: 2/17/21</em>; <em>SN Online: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>But while all eyes were on Mars, other missions are embarking on journeys to study even more far-flung places. After years of delays and billions of dollars over budget, the James Webb Space Telescope is finally set to launch, no earlier than December 25, to probe the universe’s earliest galaxies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">among other things</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, spacecraft are heading off to visit 11 asteroids in the solar system in search of clues to the origins of the planets, and water and life on Earth, as well as ways to keep our planet safe from errant space rocks.</p>





<p>Let’s meet those rock explorers.</p>

<h3>Lucy</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">NASA’s Lucy spacecraft</a> launched on October 16 on the first mission to explore <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-jupiters-orbit-goes-its-own-way">Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids</a>, two groups of space rocks that share an orbit with Jupiter around the sun (<em>SN Online: 10/15/21</em>;<em> SN: 5/13/17, p. 5</em>). The asteroids occupy areas known as Lagrange points, where the gravitational pulls of Jupiter and the sun cancel each other out. These regions are like cosmic dead zones and have been collecting planetary flotsam for billions of years. Those asteroids and other bits of debris are like fossils of the early solar system. (Fittingly, the mission was named for the famous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucy-species-brain-skull-heralded-rise-long-childhoods-hominids">hominid fossil Lucy</a>.)</p>



<p>Over the next 12 years, Lucy will make five flybys to observe seven Trojan asteroids, plus one asteroid in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter for good measure. By the end of its mission, Lucy will have visited more objects than any other NASA mission.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>DART</h3>



<p>The next mission to head out was NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, which launched November 24 to deliberately ram into an asteroid in an attempt to alter its orbit. That collision will test a technique for deflecting dangerous asteroids that could crash into Earth in the future.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s destination is a pair of asteroids called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Didymos and Dimorphos</a> (<em>SN: 8/15/20, p. 5</em>). In late September 2022, DART will crash-land on Dimorphos while moving at about 6.6 kilometers per second, which hopefully will shift its orbit around Didymos. Astronomers on Earth will be able to tell if the test worked by looking for a change in Dimorphos’ orbit time, and the European Space Agency will send a follow-up probe called Hera in 2024.</p>

<h3>Psyche</h3>



<p>Last up is Psyche, which is set to launch in August 2022. The NASA spacecraft will visit 16 Psyche, an asteroid that seems to be made up almost entirely of metal. It may be the exposed core of a protoplanet that lost its outer mantle and crust in cosmic collisions long ago. Since scientists can’t send a mission to Earth’s core, a trip to 16 Psyche may be the closest we can get to a journey to the center of the Earth.</p>



<p>Psyche will arrive at its destination in 2026 and spend 21 months measuring the asteroid’s magnetic field and composition from orbit. One question is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abf63b">whether the asteroid truly is a planetary core</a>. Even if not, the asteroid is a new kind of world that no spacecraft has visited before.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">How electric vehicles offered hope as climate challenges grew</a></h4>

              
                <p>This was another year of bleak climate news. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">Record heat waves baked the Pacific Northwest</a>. Wildfires raged in California, Oregon, Washington and neighboring states. Tropical cyclones rapidly intensified in the Pacific Ocean. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">devastating flash floods</a> inundated Western Europe and China. Human-caused climate change is sending the world hurtling down a road to more extreme weather events, and we’re running out of time to pump the brakes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in August</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>The world needs to dramatically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and fast, if there’s any hope of preventing worse and more frequent extreme weather events. That means shifting to renewable sources of energy — and, importantly, decarbonizing transportation, a sector that is now responsible for about a quarter of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.</p>



<p>But the path to that cleaner future is daunting, clogged with political and societal roadblocks, as well as scientific obstacles. Perhaps that’s one reason why the electric vehicle — already on the road, already navigating many of these roadblocks — swerved so dramatically into the climate solutions spotlight in 2021.</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, many automakers thought electric vehicles, or EVs, might be a passing fad, says Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. “It’s now clear to everyone that [EVs are] here to stay.”</p>





<p>Globally, EV sales surged in the first half of 2021, increasing by 160 percent compared with the previous year. Even in 2020 — when most car sales were down due to the COVID-19 pandemic — EV sales were up 46 percent relative to 2019. Meanwhile, automakers from General Motors to Volkswagen to Nissan have outlined plans to launch new EV models over the next decade: GM pledged to go all-electric by 2035, Honda by 2040. Ford introduced electric versions of its iconic Mustang and F-150 pickup truck.</p>



<p>Consumer demand for EVs isn’t actually driving the surge in sales, Tal says. The real engine is a change in supply due to government policies pushing automakers to boost their EV production. The European Union’s toughened CO<sub>2</sub> emissions laws for the auto industry went into effect in 2021, and automakers have already bumped up new EV production in the region. China mandated in 2020 that EVs make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030. Costa Rica has set official phase-out targets for internal combustion engines.</p>



<p>In the United States, where transportation has officially supplanted power generation as the top greenhouse gas–emitting sector, President Joe Biden’s administration set a goal this year of having 50 percent of new U.S. vehicle sales be electric — both plug-in hybrid and all-electric — by 2030. That’s a steep rise over EVs’ roughly 2.5 percent share of new cars sold in the United States today. In September, California announced that by 2035 all new cars and passenger trucks sold in the state must be zero-emission.</p>



<p>There are concrete signs that automakers are truly committing to EVs. In September, Ford announced plans to build two new complexes in Tennessee and Kentucky to produce electric trucks and batteries. Climate change–related energy crises, such as the February failure of Texas’ power system, may also boost interest in EVs, Ford CEO Jim Farley said September 28 on the podcast Columbia Energy Exchange.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more extreme weather events with global warming, and so people are looking at these vehicles not just for propulsion but for &#8230; other benefits,” Farley said. “One of the most popular features of the F-150 Lightning is the fact that you can power your house for three days” with the truck’s battery.</p>



<h4>More to navigate</h4>



<p>Although the EV market is growing fast, it’s still not fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement goals, the International Energy Agency reported this year. For the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 — when carbon emissions added to the atmosphere are balanced by carbon removal — <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050">EVs would need to climb from the current 5 percent of global car sales to 60 percent by 2030</a>, the agency found.</p>



<p>As for the United States, even if the Biden administration’s plan for EVs comes to fruition, the country’s transportation sector will still fall short of its emissions targets, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. To hit those targets, electric cars would need to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00921-7">make up 90 percent of new U.S. car sales by 2050</a> — or people would need to drive a lot less.</p>



<p>And to truly supplant fossil fuel vehicles, electric options need to meet several benchmarks. Prices for new and used EVs must come down. Charging stations must be available and affordable to all, including people who don’t live in homes where they can plug in. And battery ranges must be extended. Average ranges have been improving. Just five or so years ago, cars needed a recharge after about 100 miles; today the average is about 250 miles, roughly the distance from Washington, D.C., to New York City. But limited ranges and too few charging stations remain a sticking point.</p>



<p>Today’s batteries also require metals that are scarce, difficult to access or produced in mining operations rife with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-cobalt-mining-drc-needs-urgent-attention">serious human rights issues</a>. Although there, too, solutions may be on the horizon, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">finding ways to recycle batteries</a> to alleviate materials shortages (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>EVs on their own are nowhere near enough to forestall the worst effects of climate change. But it won’t be possible to slow global warming without them. </p>



<p>And in a year with a lot of grim climate news — both devastating extreme events and maddeningly stalled political action — EVs offered one glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>“We have the technology. It’s not dependent on some technology that’s not developed yet,” Tal says. “The hope is that now we are way more willing to [transition to EVs] than at any time before.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>This time last year, we wrote that Covid-19 had rendered 2020 a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/22/our-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2020/">year like no other</a>. Yet it quickly became clear that 2021 was going to be pretty similar, with the pandemic continuing to affect the day-to-day lives even of those of us who were lucky enough not to contract the virus. It’s not surprising, then, that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/08/developments-in-psychologys-covid-research/">much of our coverage</a> this year has focused on the work of psychologists studying the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/09/first-hand-reports-of-brain-fog-highlight-struggles-of-those-living-with-long-covid/">effects of Covid-19</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/15/domestic-violence-increased-during-lockdown-in-the-united-states/">lockdowns</a>.</p>



<p>But the year also began with some hope: vaccines had just been approved, and were being rolled out across the world. Unfortunately, alongside this massive public health effort there was a proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation. So we’ve also focused on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">efforts</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">understand how false information spreads</a> — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">and how to combat it</a>.</p>



<p>For me, the year began with hope of another kind: on 1<sup>st</sup> January I became a father. It’s no coincidence that a lot of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/20/describing-groups-to-children-using-generic-language-can-accidentally-teach-them-social-stereotypes/">my</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/15/at-just-16-months-old-toddlers-will-reward-someone-for-acting-fairly/">own</a> posts this year have been about child development. And while I was off on parental leave, <em>Research Digest </em>welcomed Emma Barratt, whose fascinating articles covered everything from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">video games</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/22/body-maps-reveal-the-range-of-sensations-and-feelings-experienced-during-hallucinations/">hallucinations</a> — and yes, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">Covid-19</a>.</p>



<p>So it’s been a year of ups and downs — and this is reflected in our most popular posts of the year, which are as wide-ranging as ever&#8230;</p>



<span id="more-44927"></span>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/07/hand-gestures-help-students-mentally-organise-new-information/"><strong>10) Hand Gestures Help Students Mentally Organise New Information</strong></a></p>



<p>Teachers might want to consider using more hand gestures in class, according to this study we covered in September. The researchers found that students were better at making inferences based on material they had just learned if their instructor had used “structure gestures”, which allocate spoken information to physical space. The team thinks this is because these gestures provide a scaffold that students can use to mentally organise information.  </p>

<p>This year’s vaccination drive was a huge public health undertaking — and one that inevitably attracted a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists. This post from February looked at one factor associated with believing in conspiracy theories: reduced levels of critical thinking. Although the work is limited by its correlational design, it suggests that fostering critical thinking skills may help to protect people against conspiratorial thinking. And for practical advice on how to talk to loved ones who may have fallen for a conspiracy theory, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">check out our feature</a> from July.</p>

<p>We all love a pithy saying — but they’re not always the most reliable sources of information about how the world works. This year, for instance, researchers found that it’s not true to say that “You can’t bullshit a bullshitter”. Using the delightfully-named “Bullshitting Frequency Scale” and “Bullshit Receptivity Scale”, the team found that people who bullshit out of a desire to impress or persuade others are also more susceptible to believing bullshit themselves. (See also “Money can’t buy happiness” — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/01/cant-buy-happiness-research-on-money-digested/">it’s a bit more complicated than that</a>).</p>

<p>Tolerance is often seen as a virtue — and yet, if you “tolerate” someone, you’re not exactly giving them a warm welcome. This study found that for people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the experience of being tolerated is actually closer to discrimination than it is to acceptance.</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/"><strong>6) How To Cope With Failure, According To Psychology</strong></a></p>



<p>Countless articles tell us how to set ourselves up for success and live our best lives. But it’s equally important — or perhaps <em>more </em>important — that we learn how to deal with the inevitable failures. So in March we highlighted five evidence-based tips for coping with failure.  </p>

<p>Separation anxiety in children is a well-known phenomenon. But a paper we covered in October looked at how it manifests in adults — and whether it is related to any particular personality traits. The team found links between adult separation anxiety and a number of personality measures, including negative emotionality, absorption, and aggression.</p>

<p>We tend to think that an accused person who makes an angry denial is more likely to be guilty than one who reacts calmly. And yet, this study showed, anger isn’t a good sign of guilt — in fact, it may be more likely that an angry person is innocent. </p>

<p>I remember completing an exercise at school that taught me whether I was a “visual”, “auditory”, or “kinaesthetic” learner. The only issue? It’s simply not true that we each have a specific &#8220;learning style&#8221; that works best for us. And yet most educators continue to believe this myth. This paper reviewed existing work on the topic, finding that a whopping 89% of teachers or trainees across studies subscribed to the idea of learning styles.</p>

                <h3>What am I really doing?</h3>
<p>RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.</p>
<p>Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
</code></pre></div>

<p>Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained/</p>
<p>Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. </p>
<p>The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. </p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/1_efxp_yDIauT01oILEJjrVw-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When patients start dialysis, the overall goal is for these treatments to become part of their lives and try to maintain as much of their daily routine including family commitments and employment. Unfortunately, this situation is not the norm. It is known that end-stage kidney disease impacts quality of life and is often associated with feelings of loss of control or loss of their previous routines.  Employment has a role in feelings of self-sufficiency and productiveness beyond the financial impact. Maintaining employment can be difficult with the time-consuming treatments, disease-related symptoms, or the physical requirements of previous employment. <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2">Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em></a> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding employment rates in adults receiving dialysis or a kidney transplant. They found between January 1966 and August 2020 the employment rate for dialysis patients was 26.3%. This is similar to what is seen in individual countries. <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/13/2/265.long">Erickson <em>et al.</em></a> had a similar percentage (23-24%) among patients starting dialysis in the United States between 1996 and 2013. Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em> also examined employment around the time of transplant.  They found the employment rate was 36.9% pre-transplant and 38.2% post-transplant.</p>
<p>In this article, the predictors for employment during dialysis and post-transplant were male gender, absence of diabetes, peritoneal dialysis, and higher educational level.  This correlates with an older study from 1996 by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8678064/">Curtin <em>et al.</em></a> In this study, they conducted a survey of dialysis patients to identify characteristics of those employed vs unemployed.  They found that pre-dialysis employment and higher educational level are associated with a significantly higher likelihood of employment rates. Those patients with higher education usually have white-collar jobs, receive salaries greater than disability benefits, often do not have physical requirements related to their work, and have jobs that can provide accommodations for disabilities. While there may be some options such as disability, this often will not provide the same income level as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the dialysis population, many are on disability because they find it too difficult to continue working because of symptoms from end-stage kidney disease, post-dialysis fatigue, or the inability to be able to take on a different role at work. There are several jobs that individuals are not eligible for once they are on certain medications or have certain conditions. Currently, there are not many options for vocational rehabilitation for individuals that can no longer perform their job duties due to having kidney disease.  This further puts a burden on those with reduced resources. Home dialysis modalities may help with some of the challenges by allowing patients for flexibility with the timing of treatments to maintain a routine work schedule. In the <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2"><em>BMC Nephrology</em> article</a>, peritoneal dialysis was associated with employment and most likely similar patterns would be seen with home hemodialysis. But, this won’t address all the challenges that impact employment. Advocacy for vocational rehab or for work accommodations such as part-time schedules or to adjust for individuals&#8217; physical limitations needs to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Posttransplantation, there is an expectation that individuals can return to more normal routines as they are freed up from dialysis treatments. For those that had been on dialysis for many years prior to transplantation or had to stop working, there may be some challenges of re-entering the workforce. These are considerations that should be part of discussions with health care providers and patients.</p>
<p>What can we do as a nephrology community to help patients stay employed or rejoin the workforce? What resources do patients need?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2021-big-if-true">These discoveries from 2021, if true, could shake up science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Discoveries in 2021 dared the world to consider grand possibilities in physics, space and the origins of life. Will these bold claims hold up to scrutiny?</p>



<h4>Antistarry night</h4>



<p>Scientists may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-stars-antistars-milky-way-galaxy-space-astronomy">spotted stars made of antimatter</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 8</em>). Finding antistars challenges a basic tenet of cosmology — that the vast majority of the universe’s antimatter, matter’s oppositely charged doppelgänger, was destroyed long ago. In 10 years of observations from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, researchers found 14 points of light emitting gamma rays at energies that are expected when matter and antimatter meet and annihilate each other — a process that could happen on the surface of antistars. The discovery hints that substantial amounts of antimatter may have survived. But proving the existence of antistars will be extremely difficult because, aside from the studied gamma rays, the light such stars give off would look just like the light from normal stars.</p>



<h4>Misbehaving muons</h4>



<p>Nothing gets physicists more excited than evidence of a new fundamental particle. Researchers with the Muon g–2 experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., flung billions of muons around the lab’s giant magnet and found that the rate at which the orientation of the muons’ magnetic poles wobbled strayed from theoretical predictions. The odd behavior suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">hidden particles are influencing the muons’ magnetic properties</a>, challenging the standard model of particle physics describing the universe’s fundamental forces and elementary particles (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/21/21, p. 6</em>). But it will take more data to convince physicists, who are still refining their predictions of muon behavior.</p>

<p>In other news that may upend our understanding of the cosmos, scientists detected <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-giant-arc-3-billion-light-years-long-cosmology-space">a giant arc of galaxies</a> stretching across more than 3 billion light-years. Such a finding is counter to the assumption that matter in the universe is evenly distributed on large scales (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 9</em>). The arc, invisible to the human eye, came to light in an analysis of about 40,000 quasars — very bright cores of distant galaxies. But some skeptics argue that the arc may be just an artifact of the human tendency to pick up patterns where none actually exist.</p>

<h4>Early arrival</h4>



<p>This year brought new evidence that humans arrived in the Americas more than 15,000 years earlier than traditionally thought, throwing support behind last year’s claim that humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-claims-big-news-if-confirmed-2020">reached North America by about 33,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/20 &amp; 1/2/21, p. 35</em>). In May, researchers reported that animal bones excavated at a cave in Mexico date to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">between about 33,000 and 28,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Chipped and sharp-edged stones that may have functioned as tools were found near the bones, hinting that humans had been in the area. And the discovery of fossilized human footprints suggests people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">roamed what’s now New Mexico around 23,000 to 21,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). If the tracks’ age is verified, it would show that humans were in North America during the pinnacle of the last ice age.</p>

<h4>Oldest animal fossils?</h4>



<p>Tiny tubes found in 890-million-year old rocks might be remnants of sea sponges. If that claim holds up, the tubes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-fossils-tubes-890-million-year-old-rock-ancient-sea-sponge">would push animal origins back by about 350 million years</a> to an oxygen-poor period considered unsuitable for animal life (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 6</em>). But some researchers aren’t convinced that the fossils are sea sponges. Skeptics point to the lack of mineralized skeletal parts, known as spicules, that are typical features of sea sponges, and the fact that many non­animal organisms can make similar tubes.</p>

<h4>Extragalactic planet</h4>



<p>Astronomers may have detected the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">first known planet outside of the Milky Way</a>, in a galaxy about 28 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 7</em>). Traditional exoplanet-hunting techniques don’t work well for such distances, so researchers looked to a type of paired star system known as an X-ray binary, which emits bright X-rays. A planet crossing, or transiting, in front of such a system would temporarily block those X-rays, alerting astronomers to the planet’s presence. Some scientists are skeptical because the discovery relied, metaphorically, on many stars to align: The planet needed to transit the X-ray binary while its orbit was perfectly in line with Earth’s point of view, just when a telescope was looking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/millipede-most-legs-eumillipes-persephone">A 1,306-legged millipede is the first to live up to its name</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millipedes, as we’ve known them, have been a lie. The Latin name for the arthropods implies an impressive set of 1,000 feet. Yet no millipede with more than 750 legs has ever been found, until now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02447-0">first millipede that lives up to its name</a> uses its 1,306 little legs to tunnel through soil deep beneath the semi-arid scrubland of Western Australia, researchers report December 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Dubbed <em>Eumillipes persephone</em>, it’s the leggiest creature ever known to crawl Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers nabbed the specimen and seven other curiously long, threadlike millipedes by dropping cups baited with leaf litter into drill holes used for mineral prospecting that were up to 60 meters deep. Eventually, the creatures were sent to entomologist Paul Marek at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg for a closer look.&nbsp;</p>

Marek et al/<em>Scientific Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The pale, cream-colored millipedes lack eyes, and massive antennae protrude from their drill bit<strong>–</strong>shaped heads — all signs of a subterranean lifestyle, Marek says. While inspecting a 95-millimeter-long female under a microscope, Marek realized he beheld something special. “I was like, Oh my god this has more than 1,000 legs,” he says. With 1,306 tiny feet in total, the specimen has nearly double that of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leggiest-animal-champ-millipede-located-after-79-year-gap">the previous record-holder</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/06</em>). “It’s pretty astounding.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers suspect <em>E. persephone’s</em> elongate, leg-packed body helps the creature maneuver through soil in up to eight different directions at once, like a tangled strand of mobile pasta. “We suspect it feeds on fungi,” Marek says, but the types of fungi living in these deep, dark habitats are unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <em>E. persephone </em>still holds many secrets, Marek is sure of one thing: “Textbooks are going to have to be changed,” he says. Paragraphs on millipedes will no longer require the caveat that technically, the name is a misnomer. “We finally have a real millipede.”</p>

                <p>With omicron spreading globally at a dizzying pace, scientists are scrambling to learn as much as they can about the latest worrisome variant of the coronavirus. First spotted in South Africa and Botswana at the end of November, omicron is already poised to soon become the dominant variant — dethroning delta — in some regions, public health officials warn. In a few places, it already has. So answers, including how sick does omicron make people and how well do vaccines hobble it, can’t come fast enough.</p>



<p>A rising tide of data on omicron is beginning to provide a glimpse at what’s ahead as we enter year three of the global pandemic, though many questions linger. And with many people preparing to gather with family and friends for holidays, experts are bracing for yet more case surges, compounded by already high infection rates in some countries linked to the still-prevalent delta variant.</p>

<p>Omicron’s collision with the holidays and travel is “a perfect storm,” Thomas Denny, a vaccine expert at Duke University, said December 16 in a call with journalists. At this point, even vaccinated people should be taking precautions, such as wearing masks indoors and testing before family gatherings, he said. “This new variant has thrown us a curve ball at the worst possible time.”</p>





<p>Still, amid the worries, there are positive signals that vaccines can still protect people from the worst of COVID-19. As many countries hurtle toward a season of omicron, here’s what researchers are learning so far.</p>



<h3>Omicron is spreading fast, already outstripping delta in some countries.</h3>



<p>Omicron’s high number of mutations in important viral proteins, and signs that the variant was behind a surge of COVID-19 cases in South Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">quickly raised red flags</a>, hurling the pandemic into yet another tsunami of uncertainty (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>In the weeks since omicron emerged, the variant has been identified in more than 85 countries. Some, like Denmark, have identified some cases that <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101146">date before South African researchers revealed omicron’s presence to the world</a> — a hint that the variant had already slipped across borders from wherever it originated before its November discovery. In many of these places, omicron infections are rising fast.</p>



<p>Omicron is responsible for nearly all new COVID-19 cases in South Africa, and is already the predominant version of the coronavirus in London. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that omicron will be the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-assessment-further-emergence-omicron-18th-risk-assessment-december-2021.pdf">most common variant across the European Union</a> by mid-January.</p>



<p>In the United States, omicron now appears to reign. The variant was responsible for <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">an estimated 73.2 percent of new infections</a> across the country for the week ending December 18, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s predictions. That’s up from an estimated 12.6 percent the previous week and 0.7 percent the week ending December 4. Omicron now accounts for an estimated 92 percent of new cases in New York and New Jersey and 96.3 percent in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.</p>



<p>Previous data suggested that estimates of omicron&#8217;s prevalence from earlier in December were lower. It takes time to collect and analyze viruses from patient samples, Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said in a December 14 call with journalists. So the numbers can &#8220;change quickly as more data comes in off machines in real time.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that in mind, omicron is likely to worsen the surge that is unfolding across the United States. Some places, including New York City, are already seeing large spikes in COVID-19 cases with numbers rising fast. It currently takes about two days for the number of omicron cases to double, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said December 15 in a White House news briefing. Highly infectious delta, in comparison, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">doubled every two weeks</a> at the beginning of its surge in the United States (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>It was a huge question whether omicron would compete with delta for global dominance. Now, some real-world studies show that omicron is coming on strong in many regions. Preliminary data from the United Kingdom show that omicron <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">is around 3.2 times as likely to spread among households as delta is</a>, researchers with Public Health England, a U.K. health agency, reported December 9.</p>



<p>And people exposed to omicron may get sick faster — and therefore be able to spread the virus sooner — than people exposed to other variants. An analysis of an omicron outbreak at a company Christmas party in Norway found that the median time that a person exposed at the party <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147">developed symptoms was three days</a>, researchers reported December 16 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. It takes slightly longer for delta infections to cause symptoms — around four days — and about five days for non-delta variants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons behind omicron’s swift spread are still fuzzy. It could be because omicron is more transmissible than delta or because it can dodge parts of the immune response. Or, more likely, it could be a mixture of both, says Kartik Chandran, a virologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Some preliminary studies done in lab-grown cells hint that omicron may turn out to be more transmissible than delta, though how much more is unclear. One reason may be because the new variant might <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1.full.pdf">make more copies of itself inside host cells than other variants do</a>.</p>



<p>Omicron may also replicate <a href="https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection">particularly well in bronchial cells</a> — which line the tubes that deliver air to the lungs — compared with how well it grows in lung tissue, researchers reported December 15 in preliminary data from the University of Hong Kong. If the virus is growing well in bronchial cells, symptoms like coughing could release a lot of viruses into the air.&nbsp;</p>





<h3>It’s still unclear if omicron causes milder disease.</h3>



<p>The Hong Kong results may be a sign that omicron might be less likely than variants like delta to invade the lungs of infected people and cause severe illness, but that’s far from definitive. “I don’t think you can really say that the virus is going to be less virulent based on that data alone,” Chandran says. “We’re going to have to wait and see what happens to people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some hopeful hints from South Africa that omicron might cause less severe disease than what delta causes. But experts caution that it’s far too early to make solid conclusions.</p>



<p>“We should not be lulled into any type of complacency,” Ryan Noach, CEO of Discovery Health, a health insurance provider based in South Africa, said December 14 in a news conference.</p>



<p>The optimism comes because hospitalizations in South Africa aren’t rising as fast as they did in previous surges. What’s more, anecdotal reports from the country suggest that fewer hospitalized patients in the current wave <a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/news/tshwane-district-omicron-variant-patient-profile-early-features?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=1ac774787b-MR_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-1ac774787b-150094665">rely on medical interventions to breathe</a>, such as supplemental oxygen.</p>



<p>That information, however, comes with a massive caveat: More than 70 percent of people there have been exposed to the coronavirus in the last 18 months, Noach said. Protection provided by previous infections, or vaccinations, could be the reason people there tend to have milder symptoms.</p>



<p>Experts need to see what happens in other parts of the world before concluding that omicron is a less virulent virus than other variants, Glenda Gray, president and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Monitoring the severity of COVID-19 cases in places with low vaccination rates and low infection rates will be particularly informative, she said.</p>



<p>A study from the United Kingdom found that so far there is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">no indication that omicron might cause milder, or more severe, COVID-19</a> than delta, researchers report December 17. Data on hospitalizations there, however, are still limited.</p>



<p>Even if omicron is ultimately linked to milder disease, that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous. More infections overall mean more hospitalizations and more deaths, even if the severe outcomes are a smaller proportion of overall omicron cases than with delta.</p>



<p>In the United States, where delta dominated until recently, the two variants are colliding — and that’s raising fears of this latest wave turning into a tsunami in some places.</p>



<p>“Our delta surge is ongoing and, in fact, accelerating,” Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in a December 14 call with reporters. “On top of that, we’re going to add an omicron surge. That’s alarming because our hospitals are already filling up. Staff are fatigued. We’re almost two years into the pandemic, and there may be limits on capacity to handle the kinds of caseloads that we see from an omicron wave superimposed on a delta surge.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Omicron can evade some antibodies.</h3>



<p>Even before omicron began to spread widely, scientists were immediately concerned that it might be able to hide from some virus-attacking antibodies. Recent studies suggest that yes, the virus can evade parts of the immune system. But as our immune defenses are multipronged, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>



<p>That worry initially came because omicron sports more than 50 mutations in various viral proteins. More than 30 of those changes are in the coronavirus’ spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells and is a major antibody target.</p>



<p>Since December 7, a slew of studies that have yet to be reviewed by other scientists has come out in support of the hypothesis that omicron can evade the immune response, showing that some antibodies don’t recognize omicron very well.</p>



<p>For example, among people vaccinated with two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, levels of immune proteins called neutralizing antibodies that stop the virus from infecting new cells were <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267417v2.full.pdf">41 times lower compared with antibodies against an older version</a> of the virus that rose to prevalence in mid-2020, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 11 at medRix.org. Previously infected people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">who have been vaccinated</a>, on the other hand, have a leg up (<em>SN: 8/19/21</em>). The study showed that antibody levels against omicron were lower in people who had received two doses of Pfizer&#8217;s shot than in similarly vaccinated individuals who had recovered from a previous infection.</p>



<p>The findings are in line with those from <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267646v1.full.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">other studies</a> that include other vaccines approved in the United States — Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — as well as ones used globally. The overall magnitude of the antibody drop differs from study to study, but all show the same pattern. Antibodies from people who had previously been infected but not vaccinated also perform poorly against omicron.</p>



<p>What’s more, omicron’s spike mutations may <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1.full.pdf">make treatments using lab-designed antibodies, called monoclonal antibodies, less effective</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 14 at medRxiv.org. Out of nine monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical use, only two neutralized omicron in lab-grown cells.</p>



<p>The good news is that a different treatment, a yet-to-be-approved pill from Pfizer called Paxlovid, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-additional-phase-23-study-results">should still work against the new variant</a>, the company said in a December 14 news release.</p>



<h3>T cells may fare better against omicron than neutralizing antibodies.</h3>



<p>Still, neutralizing antibodies that circulate in the blood are only one small piece of the immune response. Another arm appears largely undamaged.</p>



<p>Immune cells called T cells can either raise the call to arms when they detect the coronavirus or are capable of killing infected cells. T cells patrol the body searching for signs of the coronavirus. The cells identify fragments of viral proteins by doing cellular handshakes to check if cells are sending up red flags that the coronavirus has invaded. A red flag kicks the immune response into high gear.</p>



<p>It seems that many of the viral fragments that T cells recognize <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.06.471446v1">aren’t the parts of omicron with mutations</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 9 at bioRxiv.org, meaning the immune cells will probably still help protect people from getting really sick.</p>

<h3>Omicron seems more likely to cause reinfections than delta.</h3>



<p>Immunity against infection wanes in the months afterward. That combined with the immune evasiveness of omicron has raised the odds that previously infected people might get infected again.</p>



<p>Data from the United Kingdom, for instance, suggest that recovered people are <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">five times as likely to be infected by omicron</a> as by delta, researchers from Imperial College London report December 19.</p>



<p>The same appears to be true in South Africa. People who caught the virus in South Africa’s first wave, which was driven by a variant called D614G, are 73 percent as likely to get reinfected with omicron as people without known prior infections. That’s higher than the 29 percent higher risk for recovered people in September and October 2021, when delta was prevalent there. Individuals infected in the second wave caused by the beta variant face a 60 percent higher risk, up from 27 percent in September and October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vaccines may be less effective against omicron, but boosters offer hope.</h3>



<p>Early studies suggest that vaccines will still protect us, especially after getting a booster shot.</p>



<p>Lab-based studies of neutralizing antibody responses are a hint that protection from vaccines or previous infection might be diminished. Many of these same studies suggest that a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">third dose boosts antibodies back up to levels that should be protective against omicron</a>.</p>



<p>Boosters can even provide more protection than the original shots because the body churns out antibodies that have evolved to better recognize the virus every time we’re exposed to its proteins, Chandran says. So after a boost, the body doesn’t just make more antibodies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">they’re better ones</a>, too (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). But because the immune response to infections is complex and varies from person to person, experts rely on studies from people in the real world to know for sure.</p>



<p>A study in South Africa, for instance, found that the <a href="https://www.discovery.co.za/corporate/news-room#/documents/press-release-dot-pdf-417948">effectiveness of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine at stopping infection dropped</a> from 80 percent pre-omicron to 33 percent during the omicron wave. There was a less dramatic drop in the shot’s effectiveness at preventing hospitalization. Before omicron, the jab was 93 percent effective; it decreased to 70 percent amid the new surge.</p>



<p>“It’s very heartening to see these results,” Gray, of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Though the study didn’t look at the effect of booster shots, another dose should bring the vaccines’ effectiveness back up, she said. Analyses for comparing one or two doses of J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine are ongoing and should have results soon, Gray added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are similar to early estimates out of the United Kingdom, which show Pfizer’s two-dose shot is around 30 percent effective against symptoms. A booster dose <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">increased the effectiveness to between 70 percent to 75 percent</a>, according to data from Public Health England. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty because those findings are based on low numbers of cases. As time passes and more people get infected, researchers will get better estimates.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the worry about omicron has sparked a flurry of activity. People around the globe are upping their layers of protection with vaccinations, masks and pre-holiday COVID-19 tests. Experts expect that vaccines will largely keep vaccinated people out of the hospital. But with many people still unvaccinated across the United States, only time will tell whether the beginning of 2022 will be as devastating as the start of 2021.</p>



<p>“We are now waist-deep in the omicron wave,” infectious diseases physician Lemieux said in a December 20 call with journalists. The big question is how large the country’s omicron wave will be and what impact it will have on the health care system.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Watching lecture videos is now a major part of many students’ university experience. Some say they prefer them to live lectures, as they can choose when to study. And, according to a survey of students at the University of California Los Angeles, at least, many students also take advantage of the fact that video playback can be sped up, so cutting the amount of time they spend on lectures. But what impact does sped-up viewing have on learning? The answer, according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3899?af=R">new paper</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, is, within some limits, none. In fact, if used strategically, it can actually improve learning. However, what students <em>think</em> is going to be the best strategy isn’t actually what’s most beneficial, Dillon Murphy at UCLA and colleagues also report.</p>



<span id="more-44922"></span>



<p>First, the team assigned 231 student participants to watch two YouTube videos (one on real estate appraisals and the other on the Roman Empire) at normal speed, 1.5x speed, 2x speed or 2.5x speed. They were told to watch the videos in full screen mode and not to pause them or take any notes. After each video, the students took comprehension tests, which were repeated a week later. The results were clear: the 1.5x and 2x groups did just as well on the tests as those who’d watched the videos at normal speed, both immediately afterwards and one week on. Only at 2.5x was learning impaired.</p>



<p>When the team surveyed a separate group of UCLA students, they found that a massive 85% usually watched pre-recorded lectures at faster than normal speed. However, 91% said they thought that normal speed or slightly faster (1.5x) would be better for learning than 2x or 2.5x. These new results certainly suggest that this isn’t right: double-time viewing was just as good as normal viewing. It seems, then, that as long as the material can still be accurately perceived and comprehended, it’s okay to speed up playback.</p>



<p>So, a student could just watch videos at 2x speed and halve their time spent on lectures….Or, according to the results of other studies reported in the paper, they could watch a video at 2x normal speed twice, and do <em>better</em> on a test than if they’d watched it once at normal speed. The timing mattered, though: only those who’d watched the 2x video for a second time immediately before a test, rather than right after the first viewing, got this advantage.</p>



<p>The team also explored whether watching the videos at different speeds on separate occasions — initially at normal speed but then at double time, or vice versa — might make a difference to test performance immediately afterwards or a week later. Though 76% of the participants in this study said they thought watching first at normal speed then rewatching at double time would be best for learning, the order actually made no difference to test results. “Thus, although students may prefer certain study schedules or techniques, there are instances where their beliefs about self-regulated learning do not enhance learning outcomes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The results offer some guidance for students at US universities considering the optimal revision strategy. In a standard college course, a midterm exam might test on material contained in 10 hours’ of lecture videos. So a student might want to watch them in double time when they are released and then again in double time just before the exam. However, the team did only look at one-week delays between video watching and testing, so this would need to be explored in further research.</p>



<p>The researchers do also add a few caveats. While 2x viewing was fine for learning about the material in their studies — real estate appraisals and the Roman Empire — perhaps it might not work for more complex subject matter; again, only more research will tell.</p>



<p>But as so many students do report watching at faster than normal speeds anyway, this work is clearly helpful: it suggests that as long as it’s not more than 2x faster, it’s far from being a bad idea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-creatures-amazing-abilities-research-2021">Here are 7 incredible things we learned this year that animals can do</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, animals of all shapes and sizes surprised us with amazing abilities we didn’t know they had. From powerlifting to walking on the underside of water, these are the creature capabilities that most impressed us in 2021.</p>



<h4>Sea slugs that grow new bodies</h4>



<p>In a spectacular feat of whole-body regeneration, some <em>Elysia</em> sea slugs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">can grow a new body from just the head</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 4</em>). This feat may come in handy when animals are riddled with parasites and need a fresh start. The head simply detaches itself, crawls away and regrows an entirely new body, including the heart. These are the only animals with a heart that are known to regenerate so much of themselves.</p>

</div><figcaption>To document the extreme regeneration of an <em>Elysia</em> sea slug, researchers tied a leash around a natural groove in a sea slug’s neck. The sea slug escaped by discarding most of its body. While the headless body died, the head regenerated the rest of the body within 17 days.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Squirrels that parkour</h4>





<p>We’ve all seen squirrels pull off death-defying maneuvers, but now we know more about how the rodents pull off their stunts. Like masters of parkour — the sport in which people leap, bounce and climb through an obstacle course — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">squirrels gauge the bendiness of branches when jumping</a>. The rodents also use parkour-style jumps off of vertical surfaces to slow down and stick landings, researchers found (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 14</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers trained squirrels to jump through an artificial forest obstacle course to study how they leap from branch to branch without falling. High-speed camera footage showed that squirrels can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps and consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>





<h4>Animals that eat surprising animals</h4>



<p>This year upended notions of predator and prey, revealing animals making meals of one another in surprising ways. Researchers found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">more than 40 species from 11 families of spiders eat snakes</a>, using sticky silk and venomous bites to subdue serpents up to 30 times their size (<em>SN Online: 8/4/21</em>). </p>

<p>What’s more, one Seychelles giant tortoise apparently didn’t get the memo that tortoises are gentle herbivores. It was spotted stalking, catching and eating a bird chick whole, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-tortoise-video-hunting-killing-eating-baby-bird">first documented example of a tortoise hunting prey</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>In the Seychelles, an archipelago off the coast of East Africa, a tortoise — usually a strict herbivore —&nbsp;hunted, killed and ate a young bird that fell from its nest.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>A beetle that walks on water, underwater</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-springs-water">water strider</a>’s ability to walk on water is incredible enough, but the tiny water scavenger beetle flips the script: It <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beetles-walk-on-water-upside-down-underneath-surface">walks on water upside down</a>, clinging to the water’s surface from below (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 13</em>). The insect may use a small air bubble to pin its belly to the underside of the water’s surface, but just how it steps without breaking the water’s surface tension remains a mystery for now.</p>

</div><figcaption>An aquatic beetle walks along the underside of the water’s surface. The thin bubble visible along the insect’s belly may help pin it to the surface and provide a source of oxygen.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>A bird that mimics a flock</h4>



<p>The male superb lyrebird lives up to its name with its excellent vocal abilities, mimicking nearly any sound it hears in its Australian forest home — even chainsaws and cameras. Now scientists have recorded the bird <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lyrebird-mimic-entire-flock-deception-male-mating-call">mimicking the sounds of several other bird species at once</a> — replicating an entire soundscape. It’s the only known animal with this talent (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 12</em>). Because the lyrebird mimics multiple alarm calls in particular, researchers aren’t sure if it’s also trying to sound an alarm or just showing off for mates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>At the close of trying to impress a female with an elaborate song and dance, the male lyrebird adds a remarkable flourish. Its voice re-creates the alarmed chirps and wingbeats of many birds of different species, a degree of mimicry prowess never seen before in birds.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Spiders that lift prey up to 50 times their own weight</h4>



<p>In an innovative take on a pulley system, some spiders, including black widows, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">can hoist heavy prey up, up and into their webs</a> using only strands of their silk (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 13</em>). Researchers observed the spiders attaching strand after strand from their main web to large prey such as lizards, with each strand just a bit shorter than the last so that the stretchy silk slowly reeled in the prize.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>Filmed in a lab box, a&nbsp;spider tries to capture a much bigger roach to feast on. The spider attaches one silk strand after another to the struggling roach until the silk supports all of the roach’s weight. Then the spider keeps adding shorter and shorter strands that tug the monster weight of the prey up toward the main part of the web.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Polar bears that wield weapons</h4>



<p>In a macabre example of tool use by animals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bears-bludgeon-walrus-stones-tools-ice-inuit">polar bears sometimes kill walrus by bashing them with large chunks of stone or ice</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 16</em>). Inuit hunters have long reported polar bears attacking prey this way, and a review of historical and modern documentation confirms that stone-wielding polar bears are a real phenomenon. This puts polar bears on the list of tool-using animals, including crows, chimpanzees, elephants and, of course, humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/12/20/the-good-research-code-handbook/">The Good Research Code Handbook</a></h4>

              
                <p>When I was in grad school, I wrote a lot of code which ended up biting me later. It wasn&#8217;t until I got a job as a software engineer at Google that I discovered better ways of organizing code. Writing reusable, easy-to-read code is a core skill to have when you&#8217;re spending half of your grad school days in front of the computer. </p>



<p>I realized that others might be interested in learning these core skills, and so I tweeted out a feeler, and I was really overwhelmed with responses. I gave a workshop to the grad students in neuro at Harvard, then at NMA 2021, and it seemed to really hit a nerve. I took a couple of weeks off to write a long-form version and went through several rounds of editing and improving, and now it&#8217;s finally ready for primetime. Enjoy!</p>



<p><a href="https://goodresearch.dev">The Good Research Code handbook</a></p>



<p>About the tech behind the book: it&#8217;s all writing in markdown. <a href="http://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyterbook </a>takes care of translating markdown to html. I heavily customized the sphinx-book-theme template to use <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte.css</a> to make it look and feel like a book. A nice bonus is that tufte.css has a dark theme that&#8217;s easy on the eyes. The project is hosted on Github and deployed through netlify. </p>

                <p>From a record-setting black hole to the oldest animal DNA ever recovered, discoveries in 2021 stretched the limits of scientific study — and our imaginations.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>Oldest behemoth black hole</h3>



<p>More than 13 billion years ago, when the universe was a mere 670 million years old, a black hole was born. At a mass equal to 1.6 billion suns, the newly discovered supermassive black hole J0313-1806 is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">twice as heavy and 20 million years older</a> than the previous record holder for oldest known black hole (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 4</em>). The ancient behemoth is so big that it challenges notions of how supermassive black holes first formed, astronomers say.</p>

<h3>Gravity on the smallest scale</h3>



<p>Every object with mass has gravity too, according to both Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, even if it’s barely noticeable. Scientists have now measured the gravity of a gold ball 2 millimeters wide and weighing about 90 milligrams — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravity-measurement-smallest-object-mass-gold-ball">smallest object ever to have its gravitational pull measured</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 5</em>). The tiny tug revealed that gravity behaves as predicted, even for very small masses. Researchers still want to test how gravity behaves on the even smaller quantum scale, where different rules of physics may apply.</p>

<h3>Oldest opposable thumbs</h3>



<p>A 160-million-year-old pterosaur nicknamed Monkeydactyl is now the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">earliest known animal with opposable thumbs</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 16</em>). The flying reptile, officially named <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em>, may have used its thumbs and flexible joints to clamber up and through trees in what is now northeastern China. The digits could have helped it capture insects and other prey, scientists say.</p>

Astronomers detected the event by measuring gravitational waves that emanated from the collision and eventually reached Earth (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 6</em>). All previously identified sources of these ripples in spacetime consisted of two like objects colliding, such as two neutron stars or two black holes.</p>

<h3>Oldest recovered animal DNA</h3>



<p>The tooth of a Siberian <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">mammoth that lived more than a million years ago</a> has offered up the oldest DNA ever recovered from an animal (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 6</em>). The previous record holder was 700,000-year-old DNA from a fossilized horse. Scientists say the new find probably approaches the limit of how long DNA can persist. Genes from the mammoth suggest that it may have belonged to a previously unknown species.</p>

<h3>Most Denisovan DNA</h3>



<p>The mysterious hominid group known as the Denisovans died out long ago, but not without leaving a trace. The Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people of the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">get about 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans</a>, a genetic analysis revealed (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>). That’s the highest level of Denisovan ancestry yet found anywhere in the world. Researchers are using the result, along with genetic clues from other groups that carry Denisovan DNA, to retrace Denisovans’ movements through Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vikings-greenland-rising-sea-level-climate">Vikings may have fled Greenland to escape rising seas</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1721, a Norwegian missionary set sail for Greenland in the hopes of converting the Viking descendants living there to Protestantism. When he arrived, the only traces he found of the Nordic society were ruins of settlements that had been abandoned 300 years earlier.</p>



<p>There is no written record to explain why the Vikings left or died out. But a new simulation of Greenland’s coastline reveals that as the ice sheet covering most of the island started to expand around that time, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/810519">sea levels rose drastically</a>, researchers report December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in New Orleans.</p>



<p>These shifting coastlines would have inundated grazing areas and farmland, and could have helped bring about the end of the Nordic way of life in Greenland, says Marisa Borreggine, a geophysicist at Harvard University.</p>



<p>Greenland was first colonized by Vikings in 985 by a group of settlers in 14 ships led by Erik the Red, who had been banished from neighboring Iceland for manslaughter. Erik and his followers settled across southern Greenland, where they and their descendants hunted for seals, grazed livestock, built churches and traded walrus ivory with European mainlanders.</p>





<p>The settlers arrived during what’s known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts">Medieval Warm Period</a>, when conditions across Europe and Greenland were temperate for a handful of centuries (<em>SN: 7/24/19</em>). But by 1350, the climate had started taking a turn for the worse with the beginning of the Little Ice Age, a period of regional cooling that lasted well into the 19th century.</p>



<p>Researchers have long speculated that a rapidly changing climate could have dealt a blow to Greenland’s Norse society. The island probably became much colder in the last 100 years of Norse occupation, says paleoclimatologist Boyang Zhao at Brown University in Providence, R.I, who was not involved in the new research. Lower temperatures could have made farming and raising livestock more difficult, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lower temperatures would have had another impact on Greenland: the steady expansion of the island’s ice sheet, Borreggine and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Though rising sea levels usually go hand in hand with ice melting from ice sheets, oceans do not rise and fall uniformly in every place, Borreggine says. Around Greenland, sea level tends to rise when the ice sheet there grows.</p>



<p>This is for two main reasons: First, ice is heavy. The sheer weight of the ice sheet pushes the land it rests on down, meaning that as the ice sheet grows, more land is submerged. Second is gravity. Being massive, ice sheets exert some gravitational pull on nearby water. This makes the seawater around Greenland tilt upward toward the ice, meaning that water closer to the coast is higher than water in the open ocean. As the ice sheet grows, that pull becomes even stronger, and sea level close to the coast rises further.</p>



<p>Simulating the impact of the weight of the ice and its tug on Greenland’s waters, Borreggine and their colleagues found that sea level rose enough to flood the coast by hundreds of meters in some areas. Between the time the Vikings arrived and when they left, there was “pretty intense coastal flooding, such that certain pieces of land that were connected to each other were no longer connected,” they say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, some Viking sites are being inundated as a result of the overall rise in global sea level from climate change, which is being only marginally offset around Greenland by its melting ice sheet. Something similar could have happened back in the 14th and 15th centuries, destroying land that the Norse relied on for farming and grazing, Borreggine says.</p>



<p>“Previous theories about why Vikings left have really focused on the idea that they all died because it got really cold, and they were too dumb to adapt,” Borreggine says. But they say that archaeological digs have revealed a far more nuanced story, showing that Greenland’s Norse people did change their lifestyle by increasingly relying on seafood in the last century of their occupation.</p>



<p>But learning to adapt may have been too difficult in the face of an increasingly harsh landscape. The idea that rising sea levels may have been one of these challenges has merit, Zhao says, noting that the reasons why the Vikings disappeared from Greenland is nuanced.</p>



<p>As the climate changed, for example, these people may have also found themselves increasingly cut off from trade routes as the season for thick sea ice extended. And by the mid-14th century, the Black Plague was tearing through Europe, cutting into the Vikings’ biggest market for walrus ivory.</p>



<p>“Norse people came and left,” Zhao says. “But there are still a lot of unsolved questions,” including why exactly they left, he says.</p>



<p>The last written record of this society is a letter describing a wedding in 1408. A few years later, that couple moved to Iceland and started farming. Why the pair chose to leave is lost to history, but, as the new research suggests, sea level rise may have been part of the equation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>&#8220;But they won’t hurt you! They eat bugs. They’re our friends!&#8221; I’ve tried telling my now-12-year-old all these things many times over the years, but his fear of spiders persists. It’s hardly a rare fear; an estimated 6% of the general population suffer from full-blown arachnophobia. The leading explanation is that our ancestors evolved to fear spiders, and this has been passed on to us. But there are a few problems with this, point out the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01325-z">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Firstly: only 0.5% of spider species are potentially dangerous to humans. Secondly: these species are mostly found not in Africa, where modern humans evolved, but rather Australia and South America, the two continents that have been most recently colonised by people. Given this, the idea of an evolved, generalised fear of spiders doesn’t seem that compelling. Daniel Frynta at Charles University, Prague, and colleagues had another idea: perhaps we evolved to fear not “essentially harmless” spiders but a dangerous close relative with a similar body body plan: scorpions — and our brains over-generalise, reacting to spiders in the same way. To investigate this, they ran a study that would have left my 12-year-old with nightmares for months…</p>



<span id="more-44915"></span>



<p>The team collected together live specimens of 62 arthropod species: 15 spiders, 10 scorpions, 5 other arachnids (such as whip &#8220;spiders&#8221;), 10 cockroaches, 10 other &#8220;hemimetabolous insects&#8221; (a group that includes earwigs, stick insects and locusts), 6 myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and their relatives), 4 beetles and 2 crabs. Each of these animals was placed in a transparent box. These boxes were then lined up for inspection by 329 participants, who used 7-point scales to rate each on scales for fear, disgust and also beauty.</p>



<p>Let’s get beauty out of the way first: species that got high disgust ratings tended to get low beauty ratings, but there was no link between beauty and fear ratings. In other words, we can find an arthropod both scary and beautiful.</p>



<p>For fear, the team noted that the taxa fell into distinct groups. The &#8220;chelicerates&#8221; (the spiders, scorpions and other arachnids) got relatively high average scores, followed by the myriapods (which were definitely less fear-inducing) and finally the insects and crustaceans.</p>



<p>For disgust, the pattern was similar to that for fear. Myriapods did get the highest average score, but it wasn’t far off the score for spiders. Again, the beetles and crabs got the lowest scores. Overall, the fear and disgust ratings were highly correlated.</p>



<p>Bigger species did tend to trigger stronger emotional reactions — they got higher fear, disgust and beauty scores. But the deepest statistical split in the fear-and-disgust ratings was between the chelicerates cluster (spiders/scorpions/other arachnids) and a cluster of insects-plus-crustaceans. “This supports the notion that chelicerates are perceived as one cohesive group distinct from other arthropods,” the team argues.</p>



<p>Unlike the vast majority of spiders, scorpions <em>do</em> post a genuine threat, killing an estimated 2,600 people every year. Scorpions are also an ancient group, and species with a venom tailored to mammals are native to Africa and the Middle East — so our distant ancestors and dangerous scorpions could have evolved side-by-side. “Fear of scorpions therefore seems to be better warranted than fear of spiders,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Of course, the data don’t <em>show</em> that people generalise an evolved fear/disgust of scorpions to spiders. As the team acknowledges, this is a big limitation of the study. But it’s a sensible way to interpret the data, they argue. And, compared with other theories about why so many people are so scared of spiders (over dogs, say), it does indeed seem more compelling.</p>

<p><strong>Sterility gene for mosquito control</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environment-29">Science News</a></em>, December 18, 1971</p>



<p>Scientists are working hard to find a substitute for DDT in the control of malaria vector mosquitoes.… Two experiments with mosquitoes breeding in old tires in New Delhi point to an answer: a gene for sterility that would be passed to offspring.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Today, scientists are testing a variety of pesticide-free ways to control mosquito populations that spread malaria, Zika, dengue and yellow fever. One approach involves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florida-theyre-fighting-mosquitoes-meddling-their-sex-lives">infecting male bloodsuckers with a strain of <em>Wolbachia</em> bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 6/10/17, p. 10</em>). When the infected males mate with females, their offspring die before hatching. Another method tweaks mosquito DNA so that males pass on a daughter-killing trait and all female offspring die, shrinking populations over time. The mosquitoes, bred by the England-based biotech company Oxitec, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">took their first U.S. flight in May</a> following a years-long debate about the safety of such organisms.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/Bloods-140x110.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Up to 50% of intensive care unit stays are complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). This is associated with increased length of stay within the hospital, higher in-hospital death, higher healthcare cost, and risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or CKD progression.</p>
<p>Biomarkers have recently become of interest for the potential role in AKI prevention in high-risk patients, early diagnosis of AKI, identification of different renal diseases, and progression of AKI and underlying kidney disease. Biomarkers are various substances that can be found in the blood or urine which might suggest some injury or disease, and in our context kidney injury. There is a hope these biomarkers will offer a noninvasive, reliable means of testing and guiding AKI management.</p>
<p>In a study published in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology </em></a>this week, <a href="http://to pub.">Tao <em>et al</em>.</a> studied the potential of a few biomarkers independently and in combination as predictors of sepsis-induced AKI progression. The group studied the product of urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) (u[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]), urinary kidney injury molecular-1 (uKIM-1), and urinary interleukin-18 (uIL-18).</p>
<p>TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are released in the urine as a response to renal epithelial cell stress and are mediators of cell cycle arrest in tubular epithelial cells. Each of these markers has been demonstrated to predict cardiac surgery-associated AKI, but the product of these urine biomarker levels has shown to be more informative (see Table).<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25229339/"> KIM-1</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383693/">IL-18</a> suggest renal tubular damage and inflammation related to AKI. These biomarkers were shown in other studies to reflect the prediction of the progression of AKI.</p>

<blockquote><p>Current research suggests that the value may not be with a single marker but in the combinations of these markers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this study, Tao <em>et al.</em> demonstrated that all of these markers independently predicted progression of sepsis-induced AKI, but u[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] showed the best prediction. They did note that a combination of u[TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] with uKIM-1 improved the performance of predicting sepsis-induced AKI progression.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of other biomarkers being explored for high-risk, early detection, and progression of AKI. Current research suggests that the value may not be with a single marker but in the combinations of these markers. Introducing markers as clinical tools may have several benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early identification of patients at high risk of AKI;</li>
<li>Early implementation of renal protective measures such as <a href="https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdf">KDIGO</a> <a href="https://kdigo.org/guidelines/acute-kidney-injury/">bundles</a> (i.e. AKI <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/437152">care</a> bundles) and nephrotoxin avoidance;</li>
<li>Avoiding complications related to AKI and the need for kidney replacement therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>As of right now, biomarkers are costly, not readily available, and some are too specific or too sensitive. Could using a biomarker be helpful or lead to more unnecessary testing and treatment that leads to more healthcare costs? More research needs to be done before these markers can be used in clinical settings as potential tools for determining prognosis and guiding the clinical management of patients with acute kidney injury.</p>
<p>If these biomarkers were made available to you as a clinical tool, will you be using them?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">COVID-19 testing is complicated right now. Here are answers to 6 big questions</a></h4>

              
                <p>A friend texted me recently because her daughter’s class had a coronavirus outbreak and my friend had some questions about COVID-19 testing.</p>



<p>Testing has been on lots of other people’s minds and in the news lately, too. President Joe Biden announced recently that insurance providers must reimburse people for at-home coronavirus tests, and millions of tests will be available for people who don’t have insurance. Some people are making testing part of their routines before holiday gatherings.</p>



<p>Yet COVID-19 tests aren’t easy to come by everywhere. Consumers have complained that their pharmacies are sold out and that testing centers in some places <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1470396008555286530">have long lines</a>. And even if you can get your hands on a test, many folks — like my friend — have questions. In particular, she wanted to know if her daughter’s recent vaccine shot would interfere with the results of her home test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some answers to that and other queries.</p>





<h4>What do COVID-19 tests measure?</h4>



<p>There are two major categories of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus">diagnostic tests</a> you might encounter: antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests, better known as PCR tests. Both can determine whether you have a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. You can find a list of tests available in stores or at testing sites in the United States <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/covid-19TestingToolkit/molecular-based-tests/current-molecular-and-antigen-tests.html">here</a>. (Antibody tests aren’t diagnostic tests: They can detect evidence of past infections, but not current cases.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test determines whether there is viral RNA in the swab or saliva sample being tested. Those tests are the ones you would encounter most often at the doctor’s office or other testing centers, and some at-home tests allow people to swab themselves and mail the samples to a lab for PCR testing. Those tests work by first converting any of the virus’s RNA in the sample into DNA. If any of the viral genetic material is present, then <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/covid-19TestingToolkit/testing-basics/types-of-COVID-19-tests/diagnostic-tests/molecular-tests.html">multiple rounds of copying short pieces of certain viral genes </a>should produce a signal. That would be a positive test result.</p>



<p>Many of the at-home kits are antigen tests, which probe for certain viral proteins. Most of the rapid antigen tests look for the coronavirus’s nucleocapsid, or N protein. That protein helps package the viral RNA.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How accurate are the tests?</h4>



<p>Both types of tests are accurate but have strengths and weaknesses. Because of their round robin copycatting, PCR tests are very sensitive and can pick up small amounts of viral RNA, including before a person becomes contagious. The downside is that the test can still pick up RNA debris even after people have ceased making infectious viruses, potentially making people seem contagious when they aren’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At-home kits aren’t as sensitive as the PCR tests, but “the rapid antigen tests are really great, particularly if you’re symptomatic, to determine whether you have COVID at that moment,” says Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “They rival PCR for accuracy for that time” when people are symptomatic and most likely to be contagious to others.</p>



<p>But a negative test result doesn’t necessarily mean that you aren’t infected. It just means that the test didn’t detect the virus at that time.</p>



<p>“All tests are a moment in time,” Gronvall says. “There’s always going to be a moment like when you’re watching a sunrise when the light hasn’t yet come above the horizon. It’s not like the sun isn’t there. … You won’t know the day or the hour when the virus is starting to make copies of itself,” she says. For that reason, experts advise doing several rapid antigen tests a few days apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s something to keep in mind when deciding when to test over the holidays, too. Do a rapid antigen test before you go to a party to get some assurance that you’re likely not contagious to others right then. But if you’re worried that you were exposed to the virus during the celebration, “testing as soon as you get home from the party isn’t going to do much good,” Gronvall says. Health experts advise waiting five to seven days after exposure to take a test, but people are often testing positive within three to five days with the delta variant, she says. It’s unknown how long it might take to get a positive result if infected with the omicron variant.</p>





<h4>Do vaccines interfere with COVID-19 diagnostic tests?</h4>



<p>At first glance, it seems logical that a vaccine might give wonky test results. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s DNA vaccine all contain instructions for building the coronavirus’s spike protein. A PCR test might pick up on that signal, right?</p>



<p>It turns out that many PCR tests probe for multiple viral genes, including ones encoding the spike and N proteins, &nbsp;but also for an RNA polymerase that copies the virus’s genetic material and for the virus’s envelope, or E protein. A test is positive if it picks up on all of its target markers. But a signal from the vaccines’ spike protein alone isn’t enough to send up a red flag. Also the mRNA in the vaccines doesn’t stick around for long in the body, 24 to 72 hours. So the vaccines do not interfere with accurate PCR test results.</p>



<p>Most of the antigen tests detect the N protein, not the spike protein. So even if the vaccine works spectacularly well and your body is pumping out spike protein at levels that you’d get with an active infection, the antigen test would ignore it, so it won’t interfere with those test results either.</p>



<h4>Can the tests detect viral variants? &nbsp;</h4>



<p>The delta variant can’t fool either test. Omicron, however, is missing nine RNA building blocks called nucleotides in the N gene. That could <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-viral-mutations-impact-covid-19-tests#omicron">lead to false negatives</a> on a PCR test from Tide Laboratories used in more than 30 locations around the country, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports. That particular test probes for only the N gene, so the missing pieces are a problem. But antigen tests can still pick up on the N protein despite the absent bit.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Omicron is also missing a bit of the spike protein that causes what’s called “S gene dropout” in 26 PCR tests from various manufacturers, meaning that the spike gene isn’t detected even though the person is infected. That’s generally not a problem since those tests are looking for multiple viral genes. In fact, the missing spike signal may be a clue that a person is infected with omicron rather than delta and that their sample should be examined more closely. Alpha and some other variants also caused S gene dropout, so it’s not a slam dunk that the missing spike heralds an omicron infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the flip side, a second version of omicron that has been spotted in some places doesn’t cause S gene dropout. So a sample might test positive for the S gene and other markers and be mistaken for a delta variant infection, when it is really omicron.</p>



<h4>Should I use a rapid at-home test or go in for a PCR test?</h4>



<p>“It’s really a matter of time and what you need it for,” Gronvall says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When people have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but don’t have symptoms themselves, a PCR test could pick up a low-level infection possibly before people become infectious to others. “That could buy you a little time” to isolate and prevent spreading the virus to others, Gronvall says. But it may take a couple of days for some PCR test results to come in, erasing that advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapid tests could be useful for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and need to know quickly if they are contagious to others. New <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">antiviral medications</a> that may soon be on the market require people to take them within three to five days of developing symptoms, so rapid tests may help people get treatment within that narrow window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logistics also may come into play in the decision. At-home tests aren’t officially recorded, unless a person reports the results to a doctor, and even then, the result may require confirmation with a second test. Insurance companies may require such confirmation to verify that people have had COVID-19 before paying for some treatments or for monitoring for long-term effects of the disease. International travelers will also probably need to get a PCR test for official verification that they are safe to fly, Gronvall says. “You could say that you’re negative, but without proof they’re not going to take your word for it.”</p>



<h4>How long are the tests good?</h4>



<p>If stored properly, the tests should be good for a while. For instance, the Abbott BinaxNOW test I just bought says to store it between 35.6° to 86° Fahrenheit (2° to 30° Celsius). It was manufactured on November 2, and the little hourglass symbol on the box tells me it is best if used before June 19, 2022.</p>



<p>That long shelf life may prove important as we learn to live with the coronavirus. Testing could become a routine part of our lives, as people seek additional ways to socialize, work and travel safely. And my friend certainly won’t be the last parent to have to swab their little ones’ noses looking for answers either.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mrna-vaccine-next-viruses-flu-hiv-zika">These are the viruses that mRNA vaccines may take on next</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny molecules came up big in 2021. By year’s end, COVID-19 vaccines based on snippets of mRNA, or messenger RNA, proved to be safe and incredibly effective at preventing the worst outcomes of the disease.</p>



<p>mRNA vaccines tell our cells how to make a mimic of a viral protein, in this case <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">the spike protein that the coronavirus uses</a> to break into cells (<em>SN Online: 12/16/21</em>). The vaccine-generated protein then teaches the immune system what the real threat looks like should it later encounter that threat.</p>



<p>For decades, efforts to develop mRNA-based vaccines to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed">fight infectious diseases like rabies</a> have been on a slow and meandering road (<em>SN Online: 6/29/21</em>). But the urgency of the pandemic breathed new life into these attempts. The promise of mRNA technology now takes us well past this pandemic’s horizon. “We’re right at the beginning of a really exciting time,” says Anna Blakney, a bioengineer who studies RNA technology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>The dreams are big: Fighting all sorts of infections. Attacking cancer cells. Restoring specific proteins to treat genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis.</p>





<p>“It’s a really amazing technology that’s been proven over the past year,” Blakney says. But it won’t be a panacea, she cautions. “It works really well for some things. It’s unknown how well it will work for other things.”</p>



<p>Those answers might come soon. Here’s a look at four research efforts that have been aided by the swift momentum for mRNA vaccines that COVID-19 generated.</p>



<h4>Influenza </h4>



<p>Our current flu vaccines aren’t so hot. In a given year, flu shots are between 40 percent and 60 percent effective at preventing the disease. mRNA might do better. Pfizer has begun enrolling about 600 people ages 65 to 85 to find out how mRNA vaccines stack up against traditional flu shots. Moderna has already dosed participants in its own trial of such a flu vaccine, slated to include 180 adults in the United States.</p>



<h4>HIV  </h4>



<p>HIV is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies">slippery foe</a>, able to evade the immune system by quickly mutating and disguising itself in a coat of human proteins and sugars (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 14</em>). But mRNA vaccines may be able to train the body’s immune system to detect HIV in its many permutations. That’s the premise of a new clinical trial in the works, sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and including scientists from Moderna.</p>



<h4>Zika virus  </h4>



<p>There are no vaccines available to protect people against Zika virus, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zika-may-harm-14-percent-babies-exposed-virus-womb">can cause severe disabilities in children born to infected mothers</a> (<em>SN Online: 8/7/18</em>). Scientists from Moderna are currently recruiting 800 adults for a clinical trial testing an mRNA vaccine for its safety and ability to prevent Zika infection.</p>



<h4>CMV (cytomegalovirus) </h4>



<p>CMV is a common and usually harmless virus. But it can be dangerous for newborn babies who get CMV from an infected mother before they are born. An early infection can lead to premature birth, hearing loss, seizures and developmental delays. Moderna has begun testing a CMV vaccine candidate — a combination of six different mRNAs that carry instructions for proteins on the surface of CMV. The clinical trial will include nearly 7,000 people. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-johnson-vaccine-cdc-advisory-panel-mrna">The CDC recommends mRNA COVID-19 vaccines over J&J’s, citing fewer risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>People seeking a COVID-19 vaccine should choose an mRNA shot over Johnson &amp; Johnson’s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.</p>



<p>The mRNA vaccines, made by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNtech, are safer and more effective and are the preferred option, an advisory panel unanimously agreed on December 16. Shortly thereafter, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1216-covid-19-vaccines.html">signed off on the recommendation</a>, which is similar to policies in other countries. </p>



<p></p>



<p>But people who have allergies to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines and those who want the single-dose vaccine can still opt to get J&amp;J’s vaccine. The benefits of that shot, authorized for those 18 and older, still outweigh the risks. And as a single-shot vaccine, it&#8217;s been a crucial tool for getting vaccines to people who are incarcerated or transitory, such as the homeless.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The recommendation followed new data indicating that a blood-clotting side effect of J&amp;J’s shot, while rare, affects more than just young women. Of the 14.1 million people in the United States who got the J&amp;J jab from March 2 through August 31, 54 developed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-janssen-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-resume-pause-rare-blood-clot">blood-clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia</a>, or TTS (<em>SN: 4/23/21</em>).  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-12-16/02-COVID-See-508.pdf">Nine have died</a>, including one person vaccinated after August 31. Blood clots following the vaccine are suspected in two other deaths as well.</p>



<p>The blood clotting problem is most common in women 30 to 49 years old, with about 10 cases and 2 deaths per million doses given. But men ages 40 to 49, and women 18 to 29 and 50 to 64 also develop about 4 to 5 cases for every million doses of the vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had previously changed its guidance to say that anyone with a prior history of this kind of blood clot should not get the J&amp;J shot.</p>



<p>In addition, a neurological side effect called Guillain-Barré syndrome is more common with the J&amp;J vaccine than with mRNA vaccines. J&amp;J’s single-shot vaccine is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">less effective than the mRNA vaccines</a> (<em>SN: 10/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Taken together, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-12-16/04_COVID_Oliver_2021-12-16.pdf">risks and benefits of the mRNA vaccines</a> outweigh those of the J&amp;J jab. For instance, for every million women 18 to 49 years old vaccinated with the J&amp;J shot, 3,729 hospitalizations from COVID19 would be prevented. But nine cases of TTS and five cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome would be expected. The mRNA vaccines in women in that age group would avert 4,700 hospitalizations and produce two cases of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">myocarditis</a>, a usually mild inflammation of the heart muscle (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-invasive-mosquito-fish">A terrifying robot can thwart invasive mosquito fish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Invasive mosquito fish are often fearless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Free from the predators of their native range, these mosquito fish run rampant, throwing naive ecosystems from Europe to Australia out of whack. To keep the problematic fish in check, scientists are trying to strike fear back into the hearts of these swimmers with a high-tech tool: robots.</p>



<p>In a laboratory experiment, a robotic fish designed to mimic one of mosquito fish’s natural predators <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)01500-5">increased fear and stress responses</a> in mosquito fish, impairing their survival and reproduction, researchers report December 16 in <em>iScience</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While robofish won&#8217;t be deployed in the wild anytime soon, the research highlights that there are “more creative ways of preventing unwanted behavior from a species” than simply killing them, says Michael Culshaw-Maurer, an ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s just wonderful seeing work in this area.”</p>





<p>Native to parts of the western and southeastern United States, mosquito fish (<em>Gambusia </em>spp.) were let loose in freshwater ecosystems around the globe last century in a foolhardy effort to control malaria. But instead of eating malaria-transmitting mosquito larvae, the mosquito fish mostly gobble up the eggs and gnaw at the tails of native fish and amphibians, making them one of the <a href="http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/100_worst.php">world’s most destructive invasive species</a>, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>



<p>Efforts to combat mosquito fish, and many other introduced, invasive species, usually rely on mass killing with traps, poison or other blunt methods, says Giovanni Polverino, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “For most of the invasive species considered problematic, this doesn’t work,” he says, and can often harm native species too.</p>



<p>The problem isn’t necessarily the presence of mosquito fish in these ecosystems, Polverino says, but their wanton behavior enabled by a lack of predators. While predation prevents prey numbers from ballooning, merely the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ecologists-restore-war-wrecked-ecosystem-mozambique">fear of predators</a> can influence prey behavior in ways that ripple throughout an ecosystem (<em>SN: 5/5/19</em>). Polverino and his colleagues wanted to see if a robotic fish crafted to mimic one of mosquito fish’s natural nemeses, the largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>), could be just as scary and take some of the bite out of mosquito fish’s negative impact.</p>



<p>In the lab, researchers set up 12 tanks that each housed six mosquito fish (<em>G. holbrooki</em>) with six native Australian tadpoles (<em>Litoria moorei</em>) that are commonly harassed by mosquito fish. After a week of acclimatization, the team transferred each group to an experimental tank for one hour twice a week for five weeks. There, half of the groups faced a robotic predator designed to recognize and lunge at mosquito fish when they got too close to the tadpoles.</p>



<p>Fear of the robot altered the behavior, shape and fertility of the mosquito fish, both during exposure and weeks later. Mosquito fish facing the robot tended to cluster together and not explore the tank, while the tadpoles, free of harassment, ventured farther out.&nbsp;Even in the safety of their home aquariums, fish exposed to the robots were less active and more anxious — exhibited by seconds-longer freeze responses — than mosquito fish that weren’t exposed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cumulative stress taxed the fishes’ bodies too. Exposed fish lost energy reserves, becoming slightly smaller than nonexposed fish. Exposed males became more streamlined, potentially to quicken escape behaviors, the researchers say. And the sperm count of scared fish decreased by about half, on average.</p>



<p>“Instead of investing in reproduction, they’re investing in reshaping their body to escape better after only six weeks,” Polverino says. “Overall, they became less healthy and less fertile.”</p>



<p>The long-term impact that such robotic predators would have on wild mosquito fish and their neighbors remains unclear. That’s beside the point for Polverino, who says the main contribution of this study is showing that fear has significant consequences that may reduce the survival and reproduction of invasive species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our plan is not to release hundreds of thousands of these robots in the wild and pretend they will solve the problem,” Polverino says. But there may be more than one way to scare a mosquito fish. Giving the fish a whiff of their predator, for example, might induce similar changes.</p>



<p>“These are not invincible animals,” he says. “They have weaknesses that we can take advantage of that don’t involve killing animals one by one.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">Why it matters that health agencies finally said the coronavirus is airborne</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, health experts around the world revised their views about how the coronavirus spreads. Aerosol scientists, virologists and other researchers had determined in 2020 that the virus spreads through the air, but it took until 2021 for prominent public health agencies to acknowledge the fact. The admission could have wide-ranging consequences for everything from public health recommendations and building codes to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">marching band practices</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>For decades, doctors and many researchers have thought that respiratory viruses such as cold and flu viruses spread mainly by people touching surfaces contaminated by mucus droplets and then touching their faces. That’s why, in the early days of the pandemic, disinfectant wipes flew off store shelves.</p>



<p>Surface-to-face transfer is still a probable route of infection for some cold-causing viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. But it turns out that the coronavirus spreads mainly through fine aerosol particles that may hang in the air for hours, particularly indoors.</p>



<p>People spread such aerosols when coughing or sneezing, but also when talking, singing, shouting and even quietly breathing, allowing infected people to spread the disease even before they know they’re sick. Some evidence suggests that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">may be evolving to spread more easily through the air</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 6</em>).</p>





<p>It took collecting reams of data and more than 200 scientists pushing the World Health Organization and other public health agencies to acknowledge airborne spread of the coronavirus. In April 2021, both the WHO and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their recommendations to note that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">airborne spread is a major route</a> of infection (<em>SN Online: 5/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>That recognition was vital to public understanding of why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">wearing well-fitting masks</a> is necessary <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">in public indoor places</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 14</em>; <em>SN Online: 7/27/21</em>). Masking, social distancing and other measures to guard against the coronavirus are also credited with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">nearly wiping out flu</a> last winter (<em>SN Online: 2/2/21</em>). Experts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">fear a resurgence of cold and fl</a>u this winter if those measures aren’t continued (<em>SN Online: 8/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Knowledge that COVID-19 is an airborne disease has led to such measures as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-musicians-relocating-reduce-risk-concerts">rearranging seating in orchestras</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>) and updating recommendations for proper ventilation and filtration in buildings. Some scientists and activists have also suggested that the safety of indoor air should be regulated to reduce the spread of diseases, much like safety standards for food and drinking water.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tornado-climate-warming-winter-stronger">How a warming climate may make winter tornadoes stronger</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NEW ORLEANS</strong> — Warmer winters could make twisters more powerful.</p>



<p>Though tornadoes can occur in any season, the United States logs the greatest number of powerful twisters in the warmer months from March to July. Devastating winter tornadoes like the one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/14/us/tornado-damage-victims">killed at least 88 people</a> across Kentucky and four other states beginning on December 10 are less common.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But climate change could increase tornado intensity in cooler months by many orders of magnitude beyond what was previously expected, researchers report December 13 in a poster at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>Tornadoes typically form during thunderstorms when warm, humid airstreams get trapped beneath cooler, drier winds. As the fast-moving air currents move past each other, they create rotating vortices that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-research-may-upend-what-we-know-about-how-tornadoes-form">transform into vertical, spinning twisters</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/18</em>). Many tornadoes are short-lived, sometimes lasting mere minutes and with a width of only 100 yards, says Jeff Trapp, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>





<p>Over the last 20 years, tornado patterns have shifted so that these severe weather events occur later in the season and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-tornadoes-are-popping-east-mississippi">across a broader range in the United States</a> than before, Trapp says (<em>SN: 10/18/18</em>). But scientists have struggled to pin down a direct link between the twister changes and human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Unlike hurricanes and other severe storm systems, tornadoes happen at such a small scale that most global climate simulations don’t include the storms, says Kevin Reed, an atmospheric scientist at Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>To see how climate change may affect tornadoes, Trapp and colleagues started with atmospheric measurements of two historical tornadoes and simulated how those storm systems might play out in a warmer future.</p>



<p>The first historical tornado took place in the cool season on February 10, 2013, near Hattiesburg, Miss., and the second occurred in the warm season on May 20, 2013, in Moore, Okla. The researchers used a global warming simulation to predict how the twisters’ wind speeds, width and intensity could change in a series of alternative climate scenarios.</p>



<p>Both twisters would likely become more intense in futures affected by climate change, the team found. But the simulated winter storm was more than eightfold as powerful as its historical counterpart, in part due to a predicted 15 percent increase in wind speeds. Climate change is expected to increase the availability of warm, humid air systems during cooler months, providing an important ingredient for violent tempests.</p>



<p>“This is exactly what we saw on Friday night,” Trapp says. The unseasonably warm weather in the Midwest on the evening of December 10 and in the early morning of December 11 probably contributed to the devastation of the tornado that traveled hundreds of miles from Arkansas to Kentucky, he speculates.</p>



<p>Simulating how historical tornados could intensify in future climate scenarios is a “clever way” to address the knowledge gap around the effects of climate change on these severe weather systems, says Daniel Chavas, an atmospheric scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>But Chavas notes that this research is only one piece of a larger puzzle as researchers investigate how tornados might impact communities in the future.</p>



<p>One drawback of this type of simulation is it often requires direct measurements from a historical event, Reed says. That limits its prediction power to re-creating documented tornadoes rather than broadly forecasting shifts in large-scale weather systems.</p>



<p>Though the team based its predictions on only two previous tornados, Trapp says he hopes that adding more historical twisters to the analysis could provide more data for policy makers as well as residents of communities that may have to bear the force of intensifying tornadoes.</p>
