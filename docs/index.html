                A group of researchers at the University of Chicago has asked a Nature journal to retract a paper after PubPeer commenters pointed out numerous duplicated images in the article. The paper, “Synergistic checkpoint-blockade and radiotherapy–radiodynamic therapy via an immunomodulatory nanoscale metal–organic framework,” was published last month in Nature Biomedical Engineering. According to its senior author, &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/11/authors-request-retraction-of-study-in-nature-journal-and-look-into-four-more-papers/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Authors request retraction of study in Nature journal and look into four more papers</span></a>

                <p><em>This blog is part of a series exploring our APC-alternative models from Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>.&nbsp;<em>Read our previous post&nbsp;</em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Different approaches, one goal: universal Open Access</strong></p>



<p>Many research <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy">funders</a>, institutions, and <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands">governments </a>now <em>require </em>research to be made available under Open Access licensing and provide funds that can be applied to authors&rsquo; Open Access publication costs. But the ways in which Open Access is supported varies across different fields and <a href="https://council.science/current/blog/plan-s-and-open-access-interview-with-dominique-babini/">global regions</a>. There are gaps that leave many researchers who want to publish in Open Access journals without funding for APCs</p>



<p>Given the unequal circumstances, how can publishers fairly close gaps for researchers and provide fair and easy alternatives to APCs that work for all of its stakeholders?</p>



<p>At PLOS we are committed to co-creating pathways to Open Access and Open Science as we carry our mission forward. A piece of that is ensuring our approach to Open Access solutions are not one-size-fits-all. It&rsquo;s the reason we don&rsquo;t have just one institutional partnership model for all of our journals, but several that cater to the needs of the journal research communities, and the bodies who financially support researchers&rsquo; work.</p>



<p>Previously in this series we&rsquo;ve written about our other models that target specific challenges in the Open Access ecosystem&mdash;keeping costs low for selective journals through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">CAP</a>, reflecting regional economic differences through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>. Our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model similarly aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers while being flexible and granular enough to suit many different communities.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility and Simplicity through Flat Fees</strong></p>



<p>The solutions we create for researchers have to work within the boundaries of their research space, and the stakeholders that support them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flat Fee agreements at PLOS do that by offering institutions greater efficiency in how they provide broad Open Access support. Institutions pay one annual fee for unlimited publishing for their researchers across six PLOS journals&mdash;including <em>PLOS ONE</em> which alone publishes in more than 200 subject areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, researchers&rsquo; publication expenses are completely covered by their institution through a Flat Fee agreement with PLOS (as they are in our <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">CAP </a>and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity</a> models). However, the Flat Fee agreement also leaves room for institutions to balance their Open Access support with the authors&rsquo; grant funding streams. This balances the payment ecosystem in disciplines and regions where grant funding for Open Access is already strong. It also gives institutions with limited budgets a way to support (or transition to supporting) Open Access publication.</p>



<p><strong>So, does Open Access need APCs?</strong></p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along in this series you know the answer is no! Fee-free publishing for authors is both possible and sustainable and we are so excited to be pioneering these new models alongside <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=library-partnerships">institutions</a> who are ready for change. These new approaches help level the playing field so that any researcher can easily publish in the Open Access journal of their choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is still a lot of work to do before fee-free publishing is a reality for all authors, but new models are a step towards real progress. If you would like to encourage your institution to join PLOS and eliminate author fees, please consider contacting your librarian directly. Or getting in touch with us through this <a href="https://plos.org/resources/refer/">form</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/11/we-try-to-avoid-people-with-these-stereotypically-boring-traits/">We try to avoid people with these stereotypically boring traits</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Picture a boring person in your mind. What are they like? If you’re imagining someone who loves watching TV, has no sense of humour, and works in finance, your stereotype of a boring person is similar to those described in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221079104">recent study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. But whether or not these kinds of stereotypes are accurate, the researchers behind the paper find that they can have damaging social implications: people have a low opinion of those with “boring” traits, and will try to actively avoid them.</p>



<span id="more-45676"></span>



<p>The researchers, led by Wijnand A. P. van Tilburg from the University of Essex, began by asking online participants to note down “typical features” of a boring person, as well as occupations and hobbies they associated with being boring. They then grouped responses into categories: 45 pertaining to personal characteristics (e.g. “no sense of humour”); 19 relating to hobbies (e.g. “collecting”); and 28 relating to occupations (e.g.&nbsp;“banking and finance”).</p>



<p>Three further groups of participants then rated <em>how </em>boring a person with each of these characteristics, hobbies, or jobs seemed. The features most stereotypical of boring people included “not interesting”, “dull”, and “no opinions”. Occupations most associated with boring people included “data analysis”, &#8220;accounting”, and “tax/insurance”, while hobbies included “sleeping”, “religion”, and “watching TV”.</p>



<p>The researchers then turned to people’s perceptions of, and behaviour towards, people with these traits. Participants read vignettes about three people. One was given characteristics, hobbies, and a job that had all been rated as stereotypical of boring people in the previous experiment; one had traits that were rated the least stereotypically boring; and one was somewhere in the middle. (None of these fictional people was described as boring, as the researchers were interested in perceptions of people with these traits, rather than people explicitly labelled as boring).</p>



<p>Participants rated how competent (e.g. skilled or hard-working) and warm (e.g. friendly or caring) each person was. And the team found that those with highly and moderately boring traits were viewed as both less warm and less competent than those with the least boring traits.</p>



<p>The next study used the same methodology, except participants rated the extent to which they would avoid or spend time with each person. The researchers found that participants wanted to avoid the person with the most boring traits significantly more than the person with moderately boring traits, who in turn was avoided more than the person with the least boring traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a final study, participants indicated how much money they would need to receive in order to spend a given length of time with each person, ranging from one to seven days. The results showed that the more boring traits someone had, the more money participants needed to be paid in order to spend time with them. This was true regardless of the length of time they had to spend together.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the paper shows that people who hold stereotypically boring traits are judged negatively, and actively avoided. And although the results may not seem that surprising, it’s interesting to see a formal investigation into something many of us may have assumed.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that the work can’t say whether or not these stereotypes are accurate. Although we may <em>think</em> that accountants who like to sleep are boring, that doesn’t mean they are. So it’d be interesting to know more about where these stereotypes come from. The team suggests that some people may in fact use such stereotypes to seem more interesting or unique by comparison — particularly if they feel that they are being judged as boring themselves.</p>



<p>These studies were all conducted with participants in the US or UK, and there are likely cultural differences in who we perceive as boring — so these stereotypes may not generalise more broadly. It’s also clear that even within a culture, people’s perceptions of boring people vary. Some people in the first study felt that boring people liked sports and reading, for instance, and that actors and journalists tended to be boring. Although other participants didn’t rate these traits as particularly boring, this shows how varied people’s views can be. Future work could look at individual differences in these perceptions.</p>



<p>Still, the authors point out that regardless of <em>who </em>we see as boring, our negative perceptions of them may be similar. And these stereotypes could lead to harm, placing people judged to be boring at risk of loneliness and isolation. “Rather than perceiving them as performing a social ‘crime’”, the researchers write, “perhaps those seen as boring should receive some sympathy and support instead.”</p>

<p>In spite of the age-old yearning for the Fountain of Youth, there is a marked lack of research toward retaining vitality in later years. Nonetheless … [researchers] have found they can reverse transient memory loss — or senility — in older patients by giving them periodic oxygen treatments in a hyperbaric chamber.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Studies still only hint that exposing patients to 100 percent oxygen at high pressures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hyperbaric-oxygen-bounces-back">might give cognitive abilities a boost</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/85, p. 236</em>). For instance, people with persistent symptoms after mild head trauma who underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatment <a href="https://www.medgasres.com/article.asp?issn=2045-9912;year=2020;volume=10;issue=1;spage=8;epage=20;aulast=Harch">outperformed untreated individuals on memory tests</a> at least two months after the treatments, researchers reported in 2020. Exposure to high amounts of oxygen also has been shown to improve short-term memory in people who have had strokes and those with <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/203485/pdf">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. The treatments seem to work by dampening inflammation in the brain. The jury is still out on whether the method has a lasting effect on memory.</p>

From our lifespans to our intelligence, our relationships and our language, we can learn a great deal about ourselves by thinking of the human species as &#8220;the bird without feathers.&#8221; In this insightful read, learn more about how parrots, specifically, are our biological mirror image; an evolutionary parallel to ourselves.

In this book, John Parrington draws on the latest research on the human brain to show how it differs strikingly from those of other animals in its structure and function at a molecular and cellular level.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-nearest-black-hole-star-system-binary-space">Earth’s purported ‘nearest black hole’ isn’t a black hole</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nearest black hole to Earth isn’t a black hole at all. Instead, what scientists thought was a stellar triplet — two stars and a black hole — is actually a pair of stars caught in a unique stage of evolution.</p>



<p>In May 2020, a team of astronomers reported that the star system HR 6819 was probably made up of a bright, massive star locked in a tight, 40-day orbit with a nonfeeding, invisible black hole plus a second star orbiting farther away. At about 1,000 light-years from Earth, that would make this black hole <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-closest-earth-may-have-been-spotted">the nearest to us</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/20</em>). But over the following months, other teams analyzed the same data and came to a different conclusion: The system hosts <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa38682-20/aa38682-20.html">only two stars and no black hole</a>.</p>



<p>Now, the original team and one of the follow-up teams have joined forces and looked at HR 6819 with more powerful telescopes that collect a different type of data. The new data can make out finer details on the sky, allowing the astronomers <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/03/aa43004-21/aa43004-21.html">to definitively see how many objects are in the system and what type of objects they are</a>, the teams report in the March <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>.</p>





<p>“Ultimately, it was the binary system that best explains everything,” says astronomer Abigail Frost of KU Leuven in Belgium.</p>



<p>Previous observations of HR 6819 showed it as a unit, so astronomers couldn’t differentiate the objects in the system nor their masses. To nail down HR 6819’s true nature, Frost and colleagues turned to the Very Large Telescope Array, a network of four interconnected telescopes in Chile that can essentially see the separate stars.</p>



<p>“It allowed us to disentangle that original signal definitively, which is really important to determine how many stars were in it, and whether one of them was a black hole,” Frost says.</p>



<p>The scientists think one of the stars is a massive bright blue star that has been siphoning material from its companion star’s bloated atmosphere. That companion star now has little gaseous atmosphere left. “It&#8217;s already gone through its main life, but because the outside has been stripped off, and you only see the exposed core, it has similar temperature and luminosity and radius to a young star,” says Kareem El-Badry, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. El-Badry was not involved in the new study, but he <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/502/3/3436/6127309">suggested in 2021 that HR 6819 is a binary system</a>.</p>



<p>This siphoned star’s core color and brightness could fool astronomers looking at the older data into thinking it was a young star with 10 times as much mass. It originally appeared as though this star was orbiting something massive but invisible — a black hole.</p>



<p>Once the researchers unraveled the system’s details, they realized this system is a unique one, showing astronomers a phase not seen before among systems with massive stars. “It is a missing link in binary star evolution,” says astrophysicist Maxwell Moe of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was also not part of the new study.</p>



<p>Astronomers for years have seen binary systems where one star is actively pulling gas off the other, and they’ve seen systems where the donor star is just a naked stellar core. But in HR 6819, the donor star has stopped giving mass to the other. “It still has a little bit of envelope left but is quickly contracting, evolving to become a remnant core,” Moe says.</p>



<p>Frost and her colleagues are using the Very Large Telescope Array to monitor HR 6819 over a year to track precisely how the stars are moving. “We want to really understand how the individual stars in the system are ticking,” she says. The team will then use that information in computer simulations of binary star evolution. “[It’s] exciting to now have a system that we can use as kind of a cornerstone to investigate this in more detail,” Frost says.</p>



<p>Even though HR 6819 doesn’t have the nearest black hole to Earth, it appears to have something more useful to astronomers.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Even in a world increasingly battered by weather extremes, the summer 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest stood out. For several days in late June, cities such as Vancouver, Portland and Seattle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">baked in record temperatures</a> that killed hundreds of people. On June 29, Lytton, a village in British Columbia, set an all-time heat record for Canada, at 121° Fahrenheit (49.6° Celsius); the next day, the village was incinerated by a wildfire.</p>



<p>Within a week, an international group of scientists had analyzed this extreme heat and concluded it would have been virtually impossible without climate change caused by humans. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius since preindustrial levels of 1850–1900. The reason: People are loading the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases produced during the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, and from cutting down forests.</p>

<p>A little over 1 degree of warming may not sound like a lot. But it has already been enough to fundamentally transform how energy flows around the planet. The pace of change is accelerating, and the consequences are everywhere. Ice sheets in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change">Greenland</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-practically-irreversible-antarctic-melting">Antarctica </a>are melting, raising sea levels and flooding low-lying island nations and coastal cities. Drought is parching farmlands and the rivers that feed them. Wildfires are raging. Rains are becoming more intense, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">weather patterns are shifting</a>.</p>



<p>The roots of understanding this climate emergency trace back more than a century and a half. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists began the detailed measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide that would prove how much carbon is pouring from human activities. Beginning in the 1960s, researchers started developing comprehensive computer models that now illuminate the severity of the changes ahead.</p>



<p>Today we know that climate change and its consequences are real, and we are responsible. The emissions that people have been putting into the air for centuries — the emissions that made long-distance travel, economic growth and our material lives possible — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">have put us squarely on a warming trajectory</a>. Only drastic cuts in carbon emissions, backed by collective global will, can make a significant difference.</p>



<p>“What’s happening to the planet is not routine,” says Ralph Keeling, a geochemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. “We’re in a planetary crisis.”</p>

<h4>Setting the stage</h4>



<p>One day in the 1850s, Eunice Newton Foote, an amateur scientist and a women’s rights activist living in upstate New York, put two glass jars in sunlight. One contained regular air — a mix of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases including carbon dioxide — while the other contained just carbon dioxide. Both had thermometers in them. As the sun’s rays beat down, Foote observed that the jar of CO<sub>2</sub> alone heated up more quickly, and was slower to cool down, than the one containing plain air.</p>



<p>The results prompted Foote to muse on the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub>, the planet and heat. “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature,” she wrote in an <a href="https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002152491/page/383/mode/2up?view=theater">1856 paper summarizing her findings</a>.</p>

<p>Three years later, working independently and apparently unaware of Foote’s discovery, Irish physicist John Tyndall showed the same basic idea in more detail. With a set of pipes and devices to study the transmission of heat, he found that CO<sub>2</sub> gas, as well as water vapor, absorbed more heat than air alone. He argued that such gases would trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere, much as panes of glass trap heat in a greenhouse, and thus modulate climate.</p>



<p>Today Tyndall is widely credited with the discovery of how what we now call greenhouse gases heat the planet, earning him a prominent place in the history of climate science. Foote faded into relative obscurity — partly because of her gender, partly because her measurements were less sensitive. Yet their findings helped kick off broader scientific exploration of how the composition of gases in Earth’s atmosphere affects global temperatures.</p>

<h3>Heat-trapping gases&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 1859, John Tyndall used this apparatus to study how various gases trap heat. He sent infrared radiation through a tube filled with gas and measured the resulting temperature changes. Carbon dioxide and water vapor, he showed, absorb more heat than air does.</p>

<h4>Carbon floods in</h4>



<p>Humans began substantially affecting the atmosphere around the turn of the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution took off in Britain. Factories burned tons of coal; fueled by fossil fuels, the steam engine revolutionized transportation and other industries. Since then, fossil fuels including oil and natural gas have been harnessed to drive a global economy. All these activities belch gases into the air.</p>



<p>Yet Swedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius wasn’t worried about the Industrial Revolution when he began thinking in the late 1800s about changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. He was instead curious about ice ages — including whether a decrease in volcanic eruptions, which can put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, would lead to a future ice age. Bored and lonely in the wake of a divorce, Arrhenius set himself to months of laborious calculations involving moisture and heat transport in the atmosphere at different zones of latitude. <a href="https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf">In 1896, he reported that halving the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere could indeed bring about an ice age</a> — and that doubling CO<sub>2</sub> would raise global temperatures by around 5 to 6 degrees C.</p>



<p>It was a remarkably prescient finding for work that, out of necessity, had simplified Earth’s complex climate system down to just a few variables. But Arrhenius’ findings didn’t gain much traction with other scientists at the time. The climate system seemed too large, complex and inert to change in any meaningful way on a timescale that would be relevant to human society. Geologic evidence showed, for instance, that ice ages took thousands of years to start and end. What was there to worry about?</p>





<p>One researcher, though, thought the idea was worth pursuing. Guy Stewart Callendar, a British engineer and amateur meteorologist, had tallied weather records over time, obsessively enough to determine that average temperatures were increasing at 147 weather stations around the globe. In a 1938 paper in a Royal Meteorological Society journal, he <a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49706427503">linked this temperature rise to the burning of fossil fuels</a>. Callendar estimated that fossil fuel burning had put around 150 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere since the late 19th century.</p>



<p>Like many of his day, Callendar didn’t see global warming as a problem. Extra CO<sub>2</sub> would surely stimulate plants to grow and allow crops to be farmed in new regions. “In any case the return of the deadly glaciers should be delayed indefinitely,” he wrote. But his work revived discussions tracing back to Tyndall and Arrhenius about how the planetary system responds to changing levels of gases in the atmosphere. And it began steering the conversation toward how human activities might drive those changes.</p>



<p>When World War II broke out the following year, the global conflict redrew the landscape for scientific research. Hugely important wartime technologies, such as radar and the atomic bomb, set the stage for “big science” studies that brought nations together to tackle high-stakes questions of global reach. And that allowed modern climate science to emerge.</p>



<h4>The Keeling curve</h4>



<p>One major effort was the International Geophysical Year, or IGY, an 18-month push in 1957–1958 that involved a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/igy-brings-many-discoveries">wide array of scientific field campaigns</a> including exploration in the Arctic and Antarctica. Climate change wasn’t a high research priority during the IGY, but some scientists in California, led by Roger Revelle of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, used the funding influx to begin a project they’d long wanted to do. The goal was to measure CO<sub>2</sub> levels at different locations around the world, accurately and consistently.</p>



<p>The job fell to geochemist Charles David Keeling, who put ultraprecise CO<sub>2</sub> monitors in Antarctica and on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Loa. Funds soon ran out to maintain the Antarctic record, but the Mauna Loa measurements continued. Thus was born one of the most iconic datasets in all of science — the “Keeling curve,” which tracks the rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>When Keeling began his measurements in 1958, CO<sub>2</sub> made up 315 parts per million of the global atmosphere. Within just a few years it became clear that the number was increasing year by year. Because plants take up CO<sub>2</sub> as they grow in spring and summer and release it as they decompose in fall and winter, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rose and fell each year in a sawtooth pattern. But superimposed on that pattern was a steady march upward.</p>



<p>“The graph got flashed all over the place — it was just such a striking image,” says Ralph Keeling, who is Keeling’s son. Over the years, as the curve marched higher, “it had a really important role historically in waking people up to the problem of climate change.” The Keeling curve has been featured in countless earth science textbooks, congressional hearings and in Al Gore’s 2006 documentary on climate change, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.</p>



<p>Each year the curve keeps going up: In 2016, it passed 400 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere as measured during its typical annual minimum in September. Today it is at 413 ppm. (Before the Industrial Revolution, CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere had been stable for centuries at around 280 ppm.)</p>



<p>Around the time that Keeling’s measurements were kicking off, Revelle also helped develop an important argument that the CO<sub>2</sub> from human activities was building up in Earth’s atmosphere. In 1957, he and Hans Suess, also at Scripps at the time, published a paper that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1957.tb01849.x">traced the flow of radioactive carbon through the oceans and the atmosphere</a>. They showed that the oceans were not capable of taking up as much CO<sub>2</sub> as previously thought; the implication was that much of the gas must be going into the atmosphere instead.</p>

<h3>Steady rise&nbsp; </h3>



<p>Known as the Keeling curve, this chart shows the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> levels as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii due to human activities. The visible sawtooth pattern is due to seasonal plant growth: Plants take up CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; in the growing seasons, then release it as they decompose in fall and winter.</p>

<p>“Human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future,” Revelle and Suess wrote in the paper. It’s one of the most famous sentences in earth science history.</p>



<p>Here was the insight underlying modern climate science: Atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing, and humans are causing the buildup. Revelle and Suess became the final piece in a puzzle dating back to Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall. “I tell my students that to understand the basics of climate change, you need to have the cutting-edge science of the 1860s, the cutting-edge math of the 1890s and the cutting-edge chemistry of the 1950s,” says Joshua Howe, an environmental historian at Reed College in Portland, Ore.</p>



<h4>Evidence piles up</h4>



<p>Observational data collected throughout the second half of the 20th century helped researchers gradually build their understanding of how human activities were transforming the planet.</p>



<p>Ice cores pulled from ice sheets, such as that atop Greenland, offer some of the most telling insights for understanding past climate change. Each year, snow falls atop the ice and compresses into a fresh layer of ice representing climate conditions at the time it formed. The abundance of certain forms, or isotopes, of oxygen and hydrogen in the ice allows scientists to calculate the temperature at which it formed, and air bubbles trapped within the ice reveal how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were in the atmosphere at that time. So drilling down into an ice sheet is like reading the pages of a history book that go back in time the deeper you go.</p>

<p>Scientists began reading these pages in the early 1960s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cores-clues-past-climates">using ice cores drilled at a U.S. military base in northwest Greenland</a>. Contrary to expectations that past climates were stable, the cores hinted that abrupt climate shifts had happened over the last 100,000 years. By 1979, an international group of researchers was pulling another deep ice core from a second location in Greenland — and it, too, showed that abrupt climate change had occurred in the past. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tales-ice-time">a pair of European- and U.S.-led drilling projects</a> retrieved even deeper cores from near the top of the ice sheet, pushing the record of past temperatures back a quarter of a million years.</p>



<p>Together with other sources of information, such as sediment cores drilled from the seafloor and molecules preserved in ancient rocks, the ice cores allowed scientists to reconstruct past temperature changes in extraordinary detail. Many of those changes happened alarmingly fast. For instance, the climate in Greenland <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ancient-ice-reveals-wild-climate-shifts">warmed abruptly more than 20 times in the last 80,000 years</a>, with the changes occurring in a matter of decades. More recently, a cold spell that set in around 13,000 years ago suddenly came to an end around 11,500 years ago — and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-core-shows-speedy-climate-change">temperatures in Greenland rose 10 degrees C in a decade.</a></p>



<p>Evidence for such dramatic climate shifts laid to rest any lingering ideas that global climate change would be slow and unlikely to occur on a timescale that humans should worry about. “It’s an important reminder of how ‘tippy’ things can be,” says Jessica Tierney, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>More evidence of global change came from Earth-observing satellites, which brought a new planet-wide perspective on global warming beginning in the 1960s. From their viewpoint in the sky, satellites have measured the rise in global sea level — currently 3.4 millimeters per year and accelerating, as warming water expands and as ice sheets melt — as well as the rapid decline in ice left floating on the Arctic Ocean each summer at the end of the melt season. Gravity-sensing satellites have “weighed” the Antarctic and Greenlandic ice sheets from above since 2002, reporting that more than 400 billion metric tons of ice are lost each year.</p>



<p>Temperature observations taken at weather stations around the world also confirm that we are living in the hottest years on record. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hottest-year-record-temperature-2020-2016-nasa-noaa">10 warmest years since record keeping began in 1880 have all occurred since 2005</a>. And nine of those 10 have come since 2010.</p>

</div><figcaption>Arctic sea ice cover, which dips to its annual minimum in September, has declined in recent decades. In 1979, the minimum extent was 6.90 million square kilometers. By 2021, it had dropped to 4.72 million square kilometers.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Worrisome predictions</h4>



<p>By the 1960s, there was no denying that the planet was warming. But understanding the consequences of those changes — including the threat to human health and well-being — would require more than observational data. Looking to the future depended on computer simulations: complex calculations of how energy flows through the planetary system.</p>



<p>A first step in building such climate models was to connect everyday observations of weather to the concept of forecasting future climate. During World War I, British mathematician Lewis Fry Richardson imagined tens of thousands of meteorologists, each calculating conditions for a small part of the atmosphere but collectively piecing together a global forecast.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t until after World War II that computational power turned Richardson’s dream into reality. In the wake of the Allied victory, which relied on accurate weather forecasts for everything from planning D-Day to figuring out when and where to drop the atomic bombs, leading U.S. mathematicians acquired funding from the federal government to improve predictions. In 1950, a team led by Jule Charney, a meteorologist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., used the ENIAC, the first U.S. programmable, electronic computer, to produce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/machine-predicts-weather">the first computer-driven regional weather forecast</a>. The forecasting was slow and rudimentary, but it built on Richardson’s ideas of dividing the atmosphere into squares, or cells, and computing the weather for each of those. The work set the stage for decades of climate modeling to follow.</p>



<p>By 1956, Norman Phillips, a member of Charney’s team, had produced the world’s first general circulation model, which captured how energy flows between the oceans, atmosphere and land. The field of climate modeling was born.</p>



<p>The work was basic at first because early computers simply didn’t have much computational power to simulate all aspects of the planetary system.</p>



<p>An important breakthrough came in 1967, when meteorologists Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald — both at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, a lab born from Charney’s group — published a paper in the <em>Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences</em> that modeled connections between Earth’s surface and atmosphere and calculated how changes in CO<sub>2</sub> would affect the planet’s temperature. Manabe and Wetherald were the first to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/computing-link-between-sea-and-air">build a computer model that captured the relevant processes that drive climate</a>, and to accurately simulate how the Earth responds to those processes.</p>



<p>The rise of climate modeling allowed scientists to more accurately envision the impacts of global warming. In 1979, Charney and other experts met in Woods Hole, Mass., to try to put together a scientific consensus on what increasing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> would mean for the planet. The resulting “Charney report” concluded that rising CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would lead to additional and significant climate change.</p>



<p>In the decades since, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">climate modeling has gotten increasingly sophisticated</a>. And as climate science firmed up, climate change became a political issue.</p>

<p>This famous graph, produced by scientist Michael Mann and colleagues, and then reproduced in a 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, dramatically captures temperature change over time.

<h4>Backlash</h4>



<p>The rising public awareness of climate change, and battles over what to do about it, emerged alongside awareness of other environmental issues in the 1960s and ’70s. Rachel Carson’s 1962&nbsp;book <em>Silent Spring</em>, which condemned the pesticide DDT for its ecological impacts, catalyzed environmental activism in the United States and led to the first Earth Day in 1970.</p>



<p>In 1974, scientists discovered another major global environmental threat — the Antarctic ozone hole, which had some important parallels to and differences from the climate change story. Chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, of the University of California, Irvine, reported that chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, used in products such as spray cans and refrigerants, caused a chain of reactions that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freon-destroying-ozone-layer">gnawed away at the atmosphere’s protective ozone layer</a>. The resulting ozone hole, which forms over Antarctica every spring, allows more ultraviolet radiation from the sun to make it through Earth’s atmosphere and reach the surface, where it can cause skin cancer and eye damage.</p>



<p>Governments worked under the auspices of the United Nations to craft the 1987 Montreal Protocol, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ozone-accord-draws-praise-and-concern">which strictly limited the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons</a>. In the years following, the ozone hole began to heal. But fighting climate change is proving to be far more challenging. Transforming entire energy sectors to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions is much more difficult than replacing a set of industrial chemicals.</p>



<p>In 1980, though, researchers took an important step toward banding together to synthesize the scientific understanding of climate change and bring it to the attention of international policy makers. It started at a small scientific conference in Villach, Austria, on the seriousness of climate change. On the train ride home from the meeting, Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin talked with other participants about how a broader, deeper and more international analysis was needed. In 1988, a United Nations body called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, was born. Bolin was its first chairperson.</p>



<p>The IPCC became a highly influential and unique body. It performs no original scientific research; instead, it synthesizes and summarizes the vast literature of climate science for policy makers to consider — primarily through massive reports issued every couple of years. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">The first IPCC report, in 1990</a>, predicted that the planet’s global mean temperature would rise more quickly in the following century than at any point in the last 10,000 years, due to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>IPCC reports have played a key role in providing scientific information for nations discussing how to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. This process started with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rio-summit-launches-two-earth-treaties">Rio Earth Summit in 1992</a>, which resulted in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annual U.N. meetings to tackle climate change led to the first international commitments to reduce emissions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nations-draft-kyoto-climate-treaty">the Kyoto Protocol of 1997</a>. Under it, developed countries committed to reduce emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases. By 2007, the IPCC declared <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bad-worse-earths-warming-accelerate">the reality of climate warming is “unequivocal.”</a> The group received the Nobel Peace Prize that year, along with Al Gore, for their work on climate change.</p>



<p>The IPCC process ensured that policy makers had the best science at hand when they came to the table to discuss cutting emissions. Of course, nations did not have to abide by that science — and they often didn’t. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, international climate meetings discussed less hard-core science and more issues of equity. Countries such as China and India pointed out that they needed energy to develop their economies and that nations responsible for the bulk of emissions through history, such as the United States, needed to lead the way in cutting greenhouse gases.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, residents of some of the most vulnerable nations, such as low-lying islands that are threatened by sea level rise, gained visibility and clout at international negotiating forums. “The issues around equity have always been very uniquely challenging in this collective action problem,” says Rachel Cleetus, a climate policy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>By 2015, the world’s nations had made some progress on the emissions cuts laid out in the Kyoto Protocol, but it was still not enough to achieve substantial global reductions. That year, a key U.N. climate conference in Paris produced an international agreement to try to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">limit global warming to 2 degrees C, and preferably 1.5 degrees C</a>, above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>Every country has its own approach to the challenge of addressing climate change. In the United States, which gets approximately 80 percent of its energy from fossil fuels, sophisticated efforts to downplay and critique the science led to major delays in climate action. For decades, U.S. fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil worked to influence politicians to take as little action on emissions reductions as possible.</p>

<p>Such tactics undoubtedly succeeded in feeding politicians’ delay on climate action in the United States, most of it from Republicans. President George W. Bush <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-accord-reached">withdrew the country from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001</a>; Donald Trump similarly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/trump-us-withdrawal-paris-climate-pact">rejected the Paris accord in 2017</a>. As late as 2015, the chair of the Senate’s environment committee, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, brought a snowball into Congress on a cold winter’s day to argue that human-caused global warming is a “hoax.”</p>



<p>In Australia, a similar mix of right-wing denialism and fossil fuel interests has kept climate change commitments in flux, as prime ministers are voted in and out over fierce debates about how the nation should act on climate.</p>



<p>Yet other nations have moved forward. Some European countries such as Germany aggressively pursued renewable energies, including wind and solar, while activists such as Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/students-worldwide-are-striking-demand-action-climate-change">the vanguard of a youth-action movement</a> — pressured their governments for more.</p>



<p>In recent years, the developing economies of China and India have taken center stage in discussions about climate action. China, which is now the world’s largest carbon emitter, declared several moderate steps in 2021 to reduce emissions, including that it would stop building coal-burning power plants overseas. India announced it would aim for net-zero emissions by 2070, the first time it has set a date for this goal.</p>



<p>Yet such pledges continue to be criticized. At the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, India was globally criticized for not committing to a complete phaseout of coal — although the two top emitters, China and the United States, have not themselves committed to phasing out coal. “There is no equity in this,” says Aayushi Awasthy, an energy economist at the University of East Anglia in England.</p>

<h3>Past and future&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Various scenarios for how greenhouse gas emissions might change going forward help scientists predict future climate change. This graph shows the simulated historical temperature trend along with future projections of rising temperatures based on five scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Temperature change is the difference from the 1850–1900 average.</p>

<h4>Facing the future</h4>



<p>In many cases, changes are coming faster than scientists had envisioned a few decades ago. The oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, harming tiny marine organisms that build protective calcium carbonate shells and are the base of the marine food web. Warmer waters are bleaching coral reefs. Higher temperatures are driving animal and plant species into areas in which they previously did not live, increasing the risk of extinction for many.</p>



<p>No place on the planet is unaffected. In many areas, higher temperatures have led to major droughts, which dry out vegetation and provide additional fuel for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">wildfires such as those that have devastated Australia</a>, the Mediterranean and western North America in recent years.</p>



<p>Then there’s the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at more than twice the global average and communities are at the forefront of change. Permafrost is thawing, destabilizing buildings, pipelines and roads. Caribou and reindeer herders worry about the increased risk of parasites for the health of their animals. With less sea ice available to buffer the coast from storm erosion, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/collapsing-coastlines">the Inupiat village of Shishmaref, Alaska, risks crumbling into the sea</a>. It will need to move from its sand-barrier island to the mainland.</p>

<p>“We know these changes are happening and that the Titanic is sinking,” says Louise Farquharson, a geomorphologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who monitors permafrost and coastal change around Alaska. All around the planet, those who depend on intact ecosystems for their survival face the greatest threat from climate change. And those with the least resources to adapt to climate change are the ones who feel it first.</p>



<p>“We are going to warm,” says Claudia Tebaldi, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. “There is no question about it. The only thing that we can hope to do is to warm a little more slowly.”</p>



<p>That’s one reason why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the IPCC report released in 2021 focuses on anticipated levels of global warming</a>. There is a big difference between the planet warming 1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees or 2.5 degrees. Each fraction of a degree of warming increases the risk of extreme events such as heat waves and heavy rains, leading to greater global devastation.</p>



<p>The future rests on how much nations are willing to commit to cutting emissions and whether they will stick to those commitments. It’s a geopolitical balancing act the likes of which the world has never seen.</p>

<p>Science can and must play a role going forward. Improved climate models will illuminate what changes are expected at the regional scale, helping officials prepare. Governments and industry have crucial parts to play as well. They can invest in technologies, such as carbon sequestration, to help decarbonize the economy and shift society toward more renewable sources of energy.</p>



<p>Huge questions remain. Do voters have the will to demand significant energy transitions from their governments? How can business and military leaders play a bigger role in driving climate action? What should be the role of low-carbon energy sources that come with downsides, such as nuclear energy? How can developing nations achieve a better standard of living for their people while not becoming big greenhouse gas emitters? How can we keep the most vulnerable from being disproportionately harmed during extreme events, and incorporate environmental and social justice into our future?</p>



<p>These questions become more pressing each year, as carbon dioxideaccumulates in our atmosphere. The planet is now at higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> than at any time in the last 3&nbsp;million years.</p>



<p>At the U.N. climate meeting in Glasgow in 2021, diplomats from around the world agreed to work more urgently to shift away from using fossil fuels. They did not, however, adopt targets strict enough to keep the world below a warming of 1.5 degrees.</p>



<p>It’s been well over a century since chemist Svante Arrhenius recognized the consequences of putting extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Yet the world has not pulled together to avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change.</p>



<p>Time is running out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spongy-moth-new-name-replaces-ethnic-slur">The spongy moth’s new name replaces an ethnic slur</a></h4>

              
                <p>A menacing pest just became a bit less problematic, at least socially, after getting an update to its common name. <em>Lymantria dispar </em>is an invasive insect previously known as the gypsy moth — a label that contains an ethnic slur. On March 2, the Entomological Society of America renamed <em>L. dispar </em>the spongy moth.</p>



<p>The updated term is a nod to the moth’s porous egg casing. It was selected through ESA’s <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">Better Common Names P</a><a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">roject</a>, after hundreds of new name suggestions for <em>L. dispar </em>poured in from the public after the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">society retired the old name last July</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/21)</em>. ESA elected the moth for a rebrand primarily due to its frequent presence in conversation. Now, entomologists and gardeners alike can discuss the pervasive pest without using pejorative language. It’s one action in a larger mission to decolonize science, which aims, in part, to create a more diverse and inclusive atmosphere in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Decolonizing science is actually a really broad process,” says Jessica Ware, the president of ESA and an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History. “Addressing common names is just one piece of that.”</p>



<p>This is the first rebranding that the project has tackled. It will continue to gather input on insect names that perpetuate stereotypes or contain insulting references. Ware says dozens of species are waiting to be addressed, such as the Asian giant hornet (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>). And insects aren’t the only offenders: Birds, mammals and plants often have names referencing racial or ethnic slurs or white colonizers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-culture-creativity-africa-asia-stone-age">Ancient Homo sapiens took a talent for cultural creativity from Africa to Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Creativity runs deep in human evolution. Stone Age people steered their cultures through some inventive twists and turns as far-flung groups of <em>Homo sapiens</em> independently learned to cope with harsh African environments and unfamiliar Asian settings, two new reports suggest.</p>



<p>Southern African hunter-gatherers who inhabited an arid, inland landscape between around 92,000 and 80,000 years ago survived thanks to techniques and behaviors that they formulated on their own. Those ancient innovations owed nothing to seaside communities known to have influenced how many southern African groups made stone tools starting several thousand years later, say archaeologist Alex Mackay of the University of Wollongong in Australia and his colleagues.</p>



<p>And in what is now northern China, <em>H. sapiens</em> who reached the region by around 40,000 years ago also concocted novel tools and were the first in that region to grind up pigments for decorative or symbolic purposes, say archaeologist Fa-Gang Wang of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in China and colleagues.</p>





<p>Together, the studies suggest Stone Age culture was more innovative than previously thought.</p>



<p>Previous studies in Africa suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-innovation-out-africa">distinctive toolmaking methods</a> at coastal sites spread across much of the southern part of the continent from at least around 72,000 years ago until roughly 59,000 years ago (<em>SN: 10/30/08</em>). But human innovations represented by finds at a rock-shelter about 44 kilometers from southern Africa’s Atlantic coast, called Varsche Rivier 003 (or VR003), <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01667-5">challenge a popular idea</a> that developments in toolmaking and other cultural behaviors originated only in seaside, resource-rich locales where neighboring human groups could have regularly shared information, Mackay and colleagues report February 28 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>The stone tools and other artifacts found at Varsche Rivier also don’t appear at sites of comparable age situated 100 kilometers to the south. That suggests ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> at VR003 were no copycats, Mackay says. “By 92,000 years ago, humans — even those likely living in low-density populations — were more than capable of generating new ideas when left to their own devices.”</p>



<p>That doesn’t surprise archaeologist Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg. <em>H. sapiens</em> in southern Africa 100,000 years ago or more developed a range of hunting tools most likely tailored to different environments, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121002286">lightweight stone-tipped spears akin to iron-tipped javelins</a> now favored by Indigenous African hunters.</p>



<p>At that time, “<em>H. sapiens</em> populations had the necessary [mental] understanding to apply high levels of technical adaptability and creative expression wherever and whenever they needed or chose to,” says Lombard, who did not participate in either of the new studies.</p>



<p>One creative innovation at VR003 advanced stone-tool making. Stone Age people at the site slowly heated pieces of silcrete rock in open hearths, causing the chunks to shatter into small, angular fragments. Tiny, sharp-edged tools, most no longer than a paper clip, were struck off silcrete fragments. Finished products were probably used for a variety of cutting tasks and possibly hunting. Experiments with silcrete from sources near VR003 helped the researchers identify signature changes to the surfaces of heat-shattered rocks and damage produced when toolmakers struck thin flakes off those rocks.</p>



<p>Mackay’s group also unearthed 26 fragments of mollusk shells, mostly from aquatic snails called limpets. Evidence of long-distance transport of edible shellfish at the time of VR003’s occupation is rare but has been found at two other sites in arid parts of southern Africa. No evidence of interaction with coastal groups has turned up at those sites either.</p>



<p>Finally, 21 ostrich eggshell fragments uncovered at the site appear to have come from intact shells that were used as &nbsp;water vessels. Curved edges of these fragments once formed holes that were chiseled out of eggshells so that they could hold liquid, the scientists suspect.</p>



<p>People may have made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-culture-africa-inland-coasts-crystals-tools">water containers out of ostrich eggshells</a> as early as around 105,000 years ago at another inland southern African site (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).</p>



<p>More than a continent away, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04445-2"><em>H. sapiens</em> again got creative after reaching northern China’s Nihewan Basin</a> around 40,000 years ago, Wang and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Excavations at a site called Xiamabei revealed a patch of red-stained sediment, and the researchers found two pigment pieces with different mineral compositions and a pigment-stained limestone slab. The findings indicate that Xiamabei&#8217;s residents ground up colored pigment chunks roughly 9,000 years before the earliest previous evidence of pigment use in East Asia.</p>

<p>Nearly 400 stone artifacts found at Xiamabei include bladelike tools, many about the size of tiny tools at VR003. Those finds stand out as novel for northern China around 40,000 years ago, the scientists say. Seven tools displayed signs of having been attached to handles and used for tasks such as hide scraping and cutting plants or animal tissue.</p>



<p>Although no hominid fossils have been found at Xiamabei, fossils unearthed elsewhere in northern China indicate that <em>H. sapiens</em> reached the area around 40,000 years ago. Denisovans and Neandertals also inhabited northern China at that time. It’s uncertain which population — or possibly a group with mixed ancestry or cultural influences — left its mark at Xiamabei.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, a longstanding assumption that a single set of cultural innovations carried by <em>H. sapiens</em> from Africa — including beads, pendants and techniques for making tiny stone blades — swept across Asia starting perhaps 35,000 years ago appears increasingly unlikely, says archaeologist and study coauthor Shi-Xia Yang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiawatha-crater-greenland-age-younger-dryas">The mysterious Hiawatha crater in Greenland is 58 million years old</a></h4>

              
                <p>The powerful impact that created a mysterious crater at the northwestern edge of Greenland’s ice sheet happened <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2434">about 58 million years ago</a>, researchers report March 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That timing, confirmed by two separate dating methods, means that the asteroid or comet or meteorite that carved the depression struck long before the Younger Dryas cold snap about 13,000 years ago. Some researchers have suggested the cold spell was caused by such an impact.</p>





<p>Scientists spotted the crater in 2015 during a scan by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, which used airborne radar to measure the ice sheet’s thickness. Those and other data revealed that the crater, dubbed Hiawatha, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-crater-greenland-asteroid-younger-dryas">a round depression that spans 31 kilometers</a> and is buried beneath a kilometer of ice (<em>SN: 11/14/18</em>).</p>





<p>The next step was to determine how old the Hiawatha crater might be. Though the depression itself is unreachable, meltwater at the ice’s base had ported out pebbles and other sediments bearing telltale signs of alteration by an impact, including sand from partially melted rocks and pebbles containing intensely deformed, or “shocked,” zircon crystals.</p>

<p>Geochemist Gavin Kenny of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm and colleagues dated these alterations using two methods based on the radioactive decay of isotopes, or different forms of elements. For the zircons, the team measured the decay of uranium to lead, and in the sand, the researchers compared the abundances of radioactive argon isotopes with stable ones. Both methods suggest that the impact occurred about 57.99 million years ago.</p>



<p>That makes the crater far too old to be the smoking gun long sought by proponents of the controversial <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">Younger Dryas impact hypothesis</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>). The timing also isn’t quite right to link it to a warm period called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glass-bits-charcoal-hint-56-million-year-old-space-rock-impact">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>, which began around 56 million years ago (<em>SN: 9/28/16</em>). For now, the researchers say, what impact this space punch may have had on Earth&#8217;s global climate remains a mystery.</p>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274-0470">approved two more years</a> of testing Oxitec’s genetically modified mosquitoes as living pest controls, continuing a pilot program started in 2021 in the Florida Keys and expanding it to up to four counties in California. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the Florida and California state governments will consider whether to grant permission.</p>



<p>The male mosquitoes, OX5034 <em>Aedes aegypti</em> engineered by the biotech company Oxitec, carry daughter-killing genes that get passed generation to generation. When these males mate with local females outside a lab, only the sons should survive. Those inheriting the sabotage gene will grow up to mate with normal females, dooming their daughters too.</p>





<p>The wild <em>A. aegypti</em> species, an invader in North America, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquitoes-florida-now-spreading-zika-virus-health-officials-warn">can spread dengue, Zika, yellow fever and other diseases</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/16</em>). California first reported the invader in 2013, and by February 2022 had found it in 22 counties. The EPA permission, issued March 7, will now allow testing of the GM mosquitoes, if desired, in Stanislaus, Fresno, Tulare and San Bernadino counties.</p>



<p>In Florida, the permit covers just one county, Monroe, which stretches down the Keys. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">2021 mosquito releases</a> there came after more than a decade of heated debate (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Despite approval of the previous tests, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services needs to vote again on the new plans. The last time, the group voted at its next board meeting after EPA announced its decision, but “we are not sure that will happen this time around,” says Chad Huff of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District.</p>



<p>If approved and fulfilled to the EPA-set limits in both locations, nearly 2.5 billion of these GM mosquitoes could be released before permission expires April 30, 2024. Fortunately, male mosquitoes, GM or otherwise, don’t bite.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-de-extinct-christmas-rat-species-gene-editing">An extinct rat shows CRISPR’s limits for resurrecting species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Before the early 1900s, if it walked like a Christmas Island rat and talked like a Christmas Island rat, it probably was a Christmas Island rat. But if one of these now-extinct rats ever walks the Earth again, it will actually be a genetically modified Norway brown rat. And the rodent won’t be as similar to the Christmas Island rat as some would hope, a new study finds.</p>



<p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gene-editing technology such as CRISPR</a>, scientists have shifted from cloning to genetic engineering as the most promising method for “de-extinction,” or the resurrection of species that have died out (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). But unlike cloning, genetic engineering wouldn’t create an exact replica of an extinct species. Instead, the technique would edit an existing animal’s genome so that it resembles that of the desired extinct animal. The challenge is making that proxy as similar to the extinct species as possible.</p>



<p>To explore the limits of this method, researchers attempted to recover the genome of the Christmas Island rat. By comparing fragments of the extinct rat’s genetic instruction book with the genome of a living relative, the Norway brown rat, the team was able to recover about 95 percent of the extinct genome. That sounds like a lot, but it means that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00249-4">5 percent of the genes were still missing</a>, including some important to smell and the immune system, scientists report in the April 11 <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“You can only bring back what you can find. And our point is we can’t find everything,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>To get the extinct rat’s genome, Gilbert and his colleagues took ancient DNA from two preserved skin samples of the Christmas Island rat. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reviving-extinct-dna">Ancient DNA</a>, extracted from specimens that died anywhere from a few decades to thousands of years ago, is far from perfect (<em>SN: 5/19/08</em>). Gilbert describes an extinct species’ genome as a book that has been shredded. One way to reconstruct this shredded book is to scan the fragments and compare them with a reference.</p>



<p>With an intact copy of the original book, someone could theoretically reconstruct the book perfectly. When identifying a reference genome, researchers look for a species that diverged evolutionarily from the extinct species fairly recently —&nbsp;in other words, a very similar book. The genomes will match closely, but not perfectly.</p>



<p>For that reason, the Christmas Island rat (<em>Rattus macleari</em>) was an obvious choice for analysis for the scientists. It diverged from its closest relative, the Norway brown rat (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>), only around 2.6 million years ago.</p>



<p>The team found that the Christmas Island rat genome mapped to about 95 percent of the Norway brown rat genome. Further analyses showed that the roughly 5 percent that was missing could not be explained solely by a flaw in the technique or an inadequate reference genome. Rather, because of evolutionary divergence between the two species, most of that genetic information was simply lost.</p>



<p>What’s more, the missing genes weren’t random. They tended to fall within two main regions that controlled the rat’s immune responses and sense of smell. So, if a Norway brown rat’s genome was edited to resemble the Christmas Island rat, the new critter would smell in a different way than its prototype did. This could hinder a proxy Christmas Island rat’s chance at survival if it were released into its former habitat.</p>

<p>Gilbert doesn’t think it’s likely that anyone will try to de-extinct a rat. But he says that what the team has demonstrated could prove useful for people working on even more ambitious projects, like bringing back the woolly mammoth. The divergence between the Norway brown rat and the extinct Christmas Island rat, for example, is similar to that between the Asian elephant and woolly mammoth.</p>



<p>“By doing these kinds of analyses, which is not hard to do, you can at least come up with the what will you get, what will you not get, and you can use that to decide is it worth doing,” Gilbert says.</p>



<p>Despite the hurdles, using the technology to bring back species is still worth doing, says Ben Novak, lead scientist at Revive &amp; Restore, a nonprofit that uses genetic engineering for conservation projects. He plans to apply Gilbert and colleagues’ analysis to his own work on the passenger pigeon, which went extinct in 1914. There are possible solutions for how to capture some of the missing data, he says, but the fact that some data will always be missing is a limitation that de-extinction scientists have already come to terms with.</p>



<p>“The reference assembly problem will always be a barrier to de-extinction,” Novak says. “Anyone pursuing de-extinction has to settle on the fact that we want to get as close as we can to something that fools the environment.”</p>



<p>In other words, a de-extinct mammoth created using gene editing, if such a thing ever comes to be, won’t exactly be a mammoth; it will be closer to a hairy Asian elephant adapted to live in the cold. And the new analysis suggests that the proxy animal version will probably have enough differences that would make it difficult for the creature to refill its previous ecological niche. For some, that might be enough to defeat the purpose of the exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a science, it&#8217;s awesome,” Gilbert says. But “is this the best use of the money in a world where we can&#8217;t keep our rhinos alive?”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>After finding out details about a stranger, we mistakenly think that they also know about us. As a result, we act more honestly around them, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04452-3">recent study</a> in <em>Nature</em>. And this can have a real-world impact: the team finds that after residents are given biographical information about neighbourhood police officers, the crime rate in nearby areas reduces.</p>



<span id="more-45666"></span>



<p>Past research has found that we tend to assume social relationships are reciprocal. Most of the time, this assumption is accurate: someone you think of as a friend will usually consider you a friend too, for instance. But sometimes our social ties are more one-sided: for example, you might learn something about a stranger who doesn’t know you at all. Anuj K. Shah from the University of Chicago and Michael LaForest from Pennsylvania State University wondered whether, in this situation, our tendency to believe that social ties are symmetrical could lead us to mistakenly feel that a stranger does actually know us.</p>



<p>In a series of lab-based studies, this is exactly what the researchers found. In each experiment, online participants were ostensibly paired with another participant (in reality, this partner didn’t exist). Some participants were given information about their partner while others were not, before rating how well this stranger knew them.</p>



<p>In one set of studies, participants answered three multiple-choice questions about their lives; half then saw their partner’s responses to the same questions and half did not. All participants were then told that their partner was trying to guess their own answers. Participants who saw their partner’s responses believed that this stranger understood them better than those who did not.</p>



<p>In further experiments, participants wrote down four true statements and one lie about themselves. Some participants also saw statements supposedly written by a partner. Again, this group believed that the partner would be more likely to guess which of their own statements was a lie than those who didn’t read their partner’s statements. And in another study, the team found that people were more likely to give honest answers to a question if they had read information about their partner — and this effect seemed at least partly driven by the fact that these participants felt their partner knew them better.</p>



<p>These studies all suggested that when we know about strangers, we erroneously think they also know about us. But the really interesting finding came when the researchers stepped out of the lab, to conduct a field experiment in collaboration with the New York City Police Department and Housing Authority. The team developed leaflets containing fairly mundane information about local community police officers, such as their favourite food, hobbies, or reasons for joining the police force. They then sent out these leaflets to every apartment in a number of housing developments in disadvantaged areas. The officers themselves also dropped off cards to local residents containing similar information.</p>



<p>Two months later, the researchers surveyed residents at these housing developments as well as control areas that did not receive leaflets or outreach cards. Residents imagined they had committed a crime that they could be fined for, and were asked how likely it would be that local officers would find out about it. They also rated how well the officers in the area knew them.</p>



<p>The team found that residents of the developments that had received the intervention believed it more likely that local officers would find out about illegal activity than residents of the control areas (though there was no significant effect on residents’ perceptions of how well police officers knew them). Even more strikingly, the team found that immediately after the intervention, there were fewer criminal complaints and arrests in the areas around the developments that had received the intervention than around the control developments.</p>



<p>Giving people information about local police therefore seems to reduce their own sense of anonymity, and by doing so may even reduce crime rates. It’s worth noting that the reduction in crime was only seen in the first three months after the information was sent out, so this may not be a long-term solution. And, as the authors acknowledge, increasing trust in the police requires much broader reforms and changes at a societal level.</p>



<p>Still, the reduction in crime in this study was comparable to the reduction seen when police forces increase their presence in crime hotspots. This suggests that giving people more information about their local officers could be a straightforward method to achieve similar results, “without increasing the number of potentially fraught officer–citizen interactions”, the researchers conclude.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirror-beetle-shiny-camouflage-ecology">Mirror beetles’ shiny bodies may not act as camouflage after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is a story about camouflage, but forget mud-blob brown, mealy beige and somber green.&nbsp; Here scientists study mirror glitz and the paradoxical notion that there’s a shiny side to camo.</p>



<p>Mirrorlike surfaces have evolved in open-ocean fishes as well as in spiders, butterfly chrysalises and most branches of the vast diversity of beetles, says visual ecologist Amanda Franklin of the University of Melbourne. One popular idea proposes that these living mirrors might confound predators by reflecting water, leaves, twigs or whatever.</p>

<p>For a test of dry-land mirrors, Franklin and her colleagues turned to a showy group of about 40 species of scarab beetles, some with a natural gleam. In golds, bronzes, greens and blues, they climb into eucalyptus trees to flirt and mate during their native Australia’s high summer in December. “People love Christmas beetles,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>To see if good reflection gives protection, Franklin set out to create nubs of clay roughly the shape of two greenish Christmas beetles, one with a mirror finish and one matte like their real-life counterparts, <em>Anoplognathus parvulus</em> (shiny) and <em>A. prasinus</em> (dull).</p>







<p>Creating a “brushed-metal” look was easy, but she needed fake beetles with a full muscle car metal shine. Also she needed something fast to make. “If you have to sand it all day, you’re not going to be able to make a thousand,&#8221; Franklin says.</p>



<p>But prototype after prototype failed to shine. After about six weeks of frustration, “we probably had hundreds in the throw-out bin.” Working with a specialist in a hobby shop where her father for years bought supplies for making model World War II planes finally cracked the mirror mystery.</p>



<p>The trick to beetle-grade reflectivity turned out to be finding just the right super-smooth resin to coat the models before spray-painting. Then just a bit of sanding the shiny models approximated the relative difference between the mirror species and its drabber relative.</p>

<p>Franklin and her colleagues then set out more than a thousand models for six days in two regions of Australia and in both leafy and open areas. In areas with such beetle eaters as butcherbirds and cuckoo-shrikes, the researchers checked for beak marks indicating bird attacks. The mirror finish, however, <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13963">didn’t show a clear benefit</a>, Franklin and colleagues reported in the January 2022 <em>Functional Ecology</em>. The soft “bodies” of the glossy fakes had just about as many gashes and dings from bird strikes as the matte finish models did.</p>



<p>A test with people as pretend predators wearing eye-tracker rigs also failed to show that shiny things were harder to find than the scuffed, duller beetles. All faux beetles at least avoided being hungrily speared once spotted. “The benefit is that you can tell a human what to do,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>Mirror camo might still work in some predicaments, but Franklin is now wondering if the big advantage of mirror bodies perhaps has little to do with their looks. The complicated microstructures that create the mirrors might, for instance, reduce the danger of cracks or fungal cooties. <em>Homo sapiens</em> fixates on looks, but maybe the visual thrill of a Christmas beetle’s mirror is just a holiday bonus.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Olga Tveretina will talk about her work on &quot;Complexity of the Reachability and Mortality Problems for Hybrid Dynamical Systems&quot;,</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The mortality problem for a given dynamical system S consists of determining
whether every trajectory of S eventually halts.  The mortality problem is
relevant to the field of program termination, and it has been studied in
different contexts and in different variants. Closely related to mortality is
the reachability problem: does exist a trajectory starting at a given initial
state which evolves to reach a given final state. Both problems are undecidable
in general, and they are only decidable for a limited number of classes of
hybrid dynamical systems.</p>
<p>My recent related work includes results on decidability of mortality and
reachability for some hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds [1, 2].  The
complexity of these problems has received less attention of the community than
the fundamental issue of their decidability. Studying the computational
complexity of the algorithms for deciding reachability and mortality problems
presented in [1, 2] is one of my current research focuses.</p>
<p>In my talk I will discuss the computational complexity of reachability and
mortality for the closely related systems, so-called Restricted Hierarchical
Hybrid Systems. These models have been studied by P. Bell, Sh. Chen, and L.
Jackson [3], and they are a useful tool for exploring the complexity of such
problems for other kinds of systems.</p>
<p>While the current aims are to improve understanding the boundary between
decidable and undecidable systems and their computational complexity, it is
worth mentioning that hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds have important
practical applications. Areas where surfaces arise include among others
biological systems (modelling processes on cell membranes), robotics (the
configuration space of a robotic arm) and learning algorithms (finding a
low-dimensional parameterization of high-dimensional data).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-goats-vanishing-indigenous-land-culture-canada">Culturally prized mountain goats may be vanishing from Indigenous land in Canada</a></h4>

              
                <p>For thousands of years, members of the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation in Canada have prized the mountain goats that roam the craggy peaks of British Columbia’s central coast.</p>



<p>The animals have long been an important food source, explains Kitasoo/Xai’xais Chief Councillor Doug Neasloss. And “we use the mountain goat in a lot of our cultural events — songs and dances and stories.”</p>



<p>Formerly a wildlife tour guide, Neasloss remembers seeing lots of the goats in the region in past decades, but no longer. And many in the community have noticed a similar trend.</p>





<p>Goats in Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory are thought to occur at lower densities than farther east in the goats’ range in the higher Rocky Mountains. But there has been “almost zero research” on British Columbia’s coastal mountain goats (<em>Oreamnos americanus</em>), until now, says Tyler Jessen, a conservation biologist at the University of Victoria in Canada.</p>



<p>Kitasoo/Xai’xais community members partnered with Jessen and his colleagues to <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.12662">investigate the mountain goats’ status</a>. Numbers of the animals do seem to have undergone a decline since the 1980s, the team reports March 8 in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>. The reasons why remain unknown but might be a result of a warming climate, the researchers say.</p>



<p>To estimate contemporary goat numbers and density, the researchers conducted aerial surveys in 2019 and 2020, scrutinizing habitats higher than 1,000 meters above sea level in Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory near Klemtu, British Columbia. To estimate how goat numbers have changed over time, the research team interviewed individuals from the local community who regularly hunt wildlife, guide, conduct research or fish the region. For each decade back to the 1980s, participants gave estimates for how many days out of 10 they saw goats.</p>

<p>Finally, to draw inferences about goat trends over a broader geographic scale, the researchers analyzed mountain goat hunting data across British Columbia from 1980 to 2018.</p>



<p>“One of the biggest challenges we have in science, especially with population trends, is that knowledge is primarily based on the length of the study, which can be extremely limited,” says Elizabeth Flesch, a wildlife geneticist at Montana State University in Bozeman who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>That’s especially true for species tricky to count in remote, rugged habitats, like mountain goats, she says. Flesch commended the triad of independent methods that the researchers used to tackle that challenge.</p>



<p>The helicopter surveys tallied 0.25 goats per square kilometer, a low-density population. Interviews revealed that “the number of sightings of mountain goats has declined hugely since the 1980s,” says Jessen, when some Kitasoo/Xai’xais people reported seeing goats six days out of 10. That compares with 2019, “when nobody [who was interviewed] saw any goats,” Jessen says.</p>



<p>Hunting data obtained from the government of British Columbia revealed that success rates of nonresident hunters killing goats with the help of professional guides increased from the 1980s to 1990s in coastal regions all across British Columbia, and then remained relatively constant. In contrast, kills per days spent hunting have slowly and steadily declined throughout the province for resident hunters, who do not use professional guides, paralleling the Kitasoo/Xai’xais community members’ sense of declining goat numbers more locally.</p>



<p>Still, Jessen cautions, the analyses cannot distinguish population declines from shifts in distribution, meaning the coastal goats on Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory may have just relocated elsewhere, or relocated and declined. If the goat numbers are declining, the potential reasons are yet unknown, but being at low density, Jessen says, makes the goats especially vulnerable to any stressors.</p>



<p>The team suspects that climate change may be playing a role, though more research is needed. Christina Service, a wildlife biologist with the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation Stewardship Authority, says during the summer of 2019, high temperatures meant “near heatstroke for humans” hiking at those high elevations.</p>





<p>“In hot temperatures, mountain goats can be thermally stressed,” says wildlife biologist Kevin White, formerly with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. His long-term work in coastal Alaska following GPS-collared goats suggests that hot summers decrease mountain goat winter survival. But goat survival can also depend on predation, industrial disturbances and tourism, among other factors, says White, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Kitasoo/Xai’xais members have voluntarily halted goat hunting in their territory over the last two decades to avoid endangering the goats. The group is also urging provincial authorities in British Columbia to take local knowledge into account, and suspend provincially sanctioned nonresident hunting in territories like theirs where goat numbers appear low.</p>



<p>Though focused on mountain goats, the study’s methods could shed light on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silver-backed-chevrotains-have-been-rediscovered-science-after-29-years">any poorly understood wildlife population</a>, Service says (<em>SN: 11/11/19</em>) “There are lots of areas of the world where we don’t have long-term baseline information, and where there are really rich local knowledge sources.”</p>



<p>It’s a case study of what can happen, she says, “when you harness the power of different ways of knowing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">Scientists are arguing over the identity of a fossilized 10-armed creature</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ancient cephalopod fossil may be about to rewrite octopus history, but it depends on who you ask. At the very least, it’s offering up a lesson in how hard it is to classify some fossils.</p>



<p>Because their soft bodies decay easily, it’s rare to find well-preserved fossils of cephalopods, a group that includes octopus, squid and cuttlefish. The relatively slim pickings of fossils have made establishing the animals’ family tree a headache for paleontologists.</p>



<p>Enter <em>Syllipsimopodi bideni</em>, an approximately 330-million-year-old fossil with exquisitely preserved suckers and 10 arms. The specimen was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto in 1988 after its discovery in Montana’s Bear Gulch Limestone, a treasure trove for soft-bodied fossils. A closer look suggests that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28333-5">the fossil is a type of cephalopod called a vampyropod</a>, researchers from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City report March 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>If true, that would make this newly designated species the oldest ancestor of octopuses by about 80 million years. This would suggest that some ancient octopus features evolved much more quickly than previously thought. “This is overturning about 100 years of science in cephalopod evolution,” says invertebrate paleontologist Christopher Whalen. But not everyone is convinced.</p>



<p>The classification hinges on the fossil having a gladius, a hard internal body part shaped like a Roman sword of the same name. The gladius can be identified by slender growth lines along the fossil’s edge, as well as a rib running down the center of the fossil.</p>



<p>But where Whalen and paleontologist Neil Landman see a gladius, others see something else.</p>



<p>“That’s not the gladius, I’m sorry,” says Christian Klug, a cephalopod paleontologist at the University of Zurich. He argues that the slender lines are actually evidence of a flattened phragmocone, the series of chambers found in the shells of early cephalopods. And if there’s no gladius, as Klug suggests, the fossil would not be a vampyropod after all.</p>



<p>Different interpretations of fossils are not uncommon in paleontology. A famous example is <em>Tullimonstrum</em>, more commonly known as the Tully monster. First discovered in 1955, paleontologists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/identity-tully-monster-still-mystery">still disagree</a> about whether it’s a vertebrate (<em>SN: 3/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re all looking at the same fossils and the same features,” says Roy Plotnick, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. But something as simple as orientation can affect the interpretation of a fossil. Plotnick is working on a study about a fossil that was classified as a jellyfish for almost 50 years; upon flipping it upside down, he realized it’s actually a sea anemone.</p>



<p>Identifying fossil features is much more than eyeballing. For starters, paleontologists have a deep-seated knowledge of anatomy, biology and zoology. “Many of us know animal anatomy better than most biologists do,” Plotnick says. Paleontologists also need to understand the processes of fossilization and how animals decay. If a feature is missing, a paleontologist will consider whether it was absent in the animal when it was alive or just not preserved.</p>



<p>“You need to come up with a frame of reference, some sort of interpretive framework, which is based on what you see,” Whalen says. For instance, the preserved suckers allowed him to identify <em>S. bideni</em> as a cephalopod. “Once you&#8217;ve gotten that, then you can start to focus on interpreting the different structures under that framework.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prioritizing one piece of evidence over another can become somewhat subjective. “Even with well-preserved species, you can get terrific differences in interpretation,” says Kevin Padian, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Some scientists prefer not to stray from traditional means of classification. Some choose to emphasize certain parts of the anatomy over others. Some opt to lump specimens together into the same species, whereas others will differentiate them more readily.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the strength of the interpretation depends on how reasonable it is. “I usually use the phrase: What is consistent with the evidence that we have?” Plotnick says.</p>



<p>It might not sound like an exact science, but that’s the trick: Only the addition of evidence can increase certainty. In the case of <em>S. bideni</em>, the discovery of more specimens could help researchers home in on the correct interpretation. Sophisticated technologies could also help. In the last decade, new imaging techniques have been developed to look at the chemical makeup of fossils, allowing scientists to identify previously hidden details.</p>



<p>Still, “there often isn&#8217;t a definitive answer, because there&#8217;s just not enough evidence to decide for sure,” Padian says. “Nobody speaks ex cathedra in science.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Babies, monkeys and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00162/full">even bees</a> have a basic &#8220;sense of number&#8221;. They can instantly perceive that there are one, two, three or four objects in a pile, without having to count them. They can also tell at a glance that a pile of 50 objects contains more than a pile of 20, say. But what explains the unique ability of older kids and adults to go far beyond this, and mentally represent quantities much bigger than four <em>exactly</em>? Some researchers argue that language must be key — that learning to count &#8220;one&#8221;, &#8220;two&#8221;, &#8220;three&#8221;, and on and on, enables this cognitive feat. Others argue that language can’t be fundamental to this &#8220;numerical&#8221; ability.</p>



<p>Now a striking <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211034502">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> by Benjamin Pitt at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues comes down firmly on the side of language as being key. And this has a broader significance. It supports the hotly contested idea that language itself influences or even enables abilities that have been viewed as being completely independent — such as colour perception, or, in this case, understanding of number.</p>



<span id="more-45635"></span>



<p>Earlier studies have suggested that a knowledge of number words is important for understanding exact numbers above four. But these studies have suffered from various drawbacks. Take work on the Pirahã, an indigenous group living in the Brazilian Amazon who have no words for any exact quantity, not even &#8220;one&#8221;. Pirahã adults seem to be able to mentally represent only up to about four objects. But as Pitt and his colleagues note, they <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/21/episode-23-whose-psychology-is-it-anyway-making-psychological-research-more-representative/">differ from WEIRD comparison groups</a> in all sorts of ways, beyond differences in number language. Some researchers have suggested that their performance might reflect simply their society’s &#8220;indifference&#8221; to exact large numbers, rather than an inability to form concepts of them, for example. </p>



<p>Pitt and his team turned to the Tsimane&#8217;, a society of farmer-foragers who live in the remote Bolivian Amazon (but who, it has to be said, have featured in all manner of studies looking at cross-cultural differences in perception, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/17/culture-plays-an-important-role-in-our-perception-of-musical-pitch-according-to-study-of-bolivias-tsimane-people/">including music perception</a>; they may not be familiar with Western culture but they must be getting <em>very</em> familiar with Western researchers).</p>



<p>Ideally for the team’s research purposes, the Tsimane&#8217; language features a full number system, but while some adults have an excellent knowledge of it and can count indefinitely, others have a very limited knowledge of number words. This allowed the team to compare the performance of &#8220;high&#8221; vs &#8220;low&#8221; counters within the same culture.</p>



<p>To do this, they gave adult participants pebble-matching tasks. The strongest test of exact number understanding was an &#8220;orthogonal-matching task&#8221;. A line of white pebbles was placed vertically, stretching away from the participant. Their task was to use glass pebbles to create a matching horizontal line beneath. To succeed at this task, a participant had to understand the exact number of white pebbles, and place the same number of glass pebbles in their line.</p>



<p>The team first ascertained the participant’s highest verbal word count. Then high counters (who could count above 40) started with a line of 10 white pebbles, while low counters started with two fewer pebbles than their highest verbal word count (which ranged from 6 to 20). From this point on, if they placed the correct number of glass pebbles to match the white ones,  the team increased the number of pebbles in the next array by two. If they were wrong, they were given one fewer pebble in their next array. This continued until a participant did one of three things: they did not make a perfect match for the same number of pebbles three times; they correctly matched three arrays of 20 pebbles or more; they completed 20 trials.</p>



<p>The team were then able to compare each participant’s verbal word count with the number of pebbles at which they started to make mistakes — the point at which they switched from exactly reproducing the target array to approximating it.</p>



<p>The results were clear: the switch point for high counters was far higher — averaging 28, compared with just 7 (and never exceeding 11) for the low counters. Importantly, with one exception, the participants’ switch points were <em>at or below</em> their highest verbal word count — even for pebble sets smaller than ten. When the number of target pebbles approached or reached the number that they had a word for, they started approximating. And this led to the team to an important conclusion: within this group “the ability to represent exact numbers was limited to the part of the verbal count list they had mastered”. This, they argue, “represents the strongest evidence to date that number words play a functional role in representing large exact numbers”.</p>



<p>Given the debate over the extent to which language might underpin or enable very different abilities, this is a really significant finding. It doesn’t mean that language is the <em>only</em> tool that can enable understanding of large exact numbers, however. Patterns of counters on an abacus, for example, work as wordless symbols of even extremely large numbers. But as the team writes, their new findings suggest that “whatever set of symbols people use, their ability to represent large exact numbers extends only as far as their mastery of those symbols”.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211034502">Exact Number Concepts Are Limited to the Verbal Count Range</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-red-giant-age-gas-rings-new-image-white-dwarf">A new image captures enormous gas rings encircling an aging red star</a></h4>

              
                <p>Huge rings of gas surround a large red star named V Hydrae, new images show, signaling its eventual transformation into a much smaller and bluer star.</p>



<p>“It’s definitely going through its metamorphosis,” says Raghvendra Sahai, an astronomer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “Such ringlike structures have never been seen in any object like this before.”</p>



<p>Observations of the three concentric rings, all ejected from the star during the last 800 years, could help astronomers understand how giant stars lose mass toward the end of their lives and seed the cosmos with planet- and life-building elements.</p>





<p>Born roughly twice as massive as the sun and lying about 1,300 light-years from Earth, V Hydrae is what’s known as an asymptotic giant branch star. It once fused hydrogen in its core, as the sun does. But now it is a cool, brilliant, puffed-up star that alternately burns hydrogen and helium in shells around a carbon-oxygen core. Such stars cast lots of material into space.</p>



<p>“The processes by which this happens are not well-understood,” says Sahai, who has studied V Hydrae since the 1980s.</p>



<p>His team used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of radio telescopes in Chile, also known as ALMA, to detect the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09335">three rings of gas</a>. Beyond them lie three additional rings, which are fainter and seen only partially, Sahai and colleagues report in a paper submitted February 18 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>The outermost complete ring now sits about 260 billion kilometers from the star, or 1,740 times as far as Earth is from the sun — more than 40 times Pluto’s distance from Earth. By measuring the speed at which the three complete rings are moving outward and their current distances from the star, the astronomers calculate that it cast them off about 270, 485 and 780 years ago.</p>



<p>It’s thought that another star orbits the main one every few hundred years on an elliptical orbit. When the companion dives in, it can trigger the giant star to cast more material into space, the team says.</p>



<p>The new image is striking and unusual, and it illustrates how a companion star enhances a giant star’s loss of mass, says Joel Kastner, an astronomer at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York who was not part of the study. “Mass loss is very important because it’s how the elements of life get distributed from stars into the universe.”</p>



<p>Stars like V Hydrae <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">forged most of the nitrogen</a> in Earth’s air as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-mass-binary-system-carbon-factories-space">much of our planet’s carbon</a>, the basis for all terrestrial life (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>;<em> SN: 11/18/21</em>). V Hydrae has so many carbon compounds in its atmosphere that it’s classified as a carbon star. It’s also one of the reddest stars known because those compounds as well as dust particles absorb its blue and violet light.</p>



<p>Sahai expects the star’s ejection of material to continue, but, he says, “it’s anybody’s guess as to how many more rings will be produced.”</p>



<p>When the star loses all of its atmosphere, probably many thousands of years from now, it will expose its hot core, whose ultraviolet light will set the cast-off material aglow, creating a beautiful bubble of gas known as a planetary nebula.</p>



<p>When the nebula dissipates, all that will remain of the magnificent red star will be a tiny blue one — a white dwarf — a little larger than Earth, plus innumerable life-giving elements floating through the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-power-weapons-risk-physics">Russia’s war in Ukraine raises nuclear risks, physicists warn</a></h4>

              
                <p>Russia’s war with Ukraine is heightening nuclear fears on two fronts. Attacks on nuclear facilities have raised concerns about accidents, and threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin have amped up worries over the potential for nuclear warfare.</p>



<p>Physicists historically have played a role in creating these technologies, and in keeping humankind safe from the dangers posed by them. Here’s what two key physicists have to say about the nuclear issues raised by the war in Ukraine.</p>



<h4>Nuclear power</h4>





<p>On March 4, Russian forces shelled Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;nuclear power plant, causing a fire in one of the site’s buildings. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, it normally provides more than 20 percent of Ukraine’s power. Radiation levels have <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/updated-information-about-zaporizhzhia-npp-znpp">remained normal</a>, according to the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine. But the danger to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants is not over, Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a March 4 news briefing.</p>



<p>“These plants are now in a situation that few people ever seriously contemplated when they were originally built, and that is the potential that they would be in the middle of a war zone,” said Lyman, a physicist by training. “No nuclear plant has been designed to withstand the potential threat of a full-scale military attack, and the plants in Ukraine are no exception.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Nuclear zones</h3>



<p>Ukraine has four active nuclear power plants — Zaporizhzhya, Rivno, Khmelnitsky and South Ukraine — and an additional nuclear facility at Chernobyl, the site of a 1986 accident that contaminated the area.</p>

<p>The Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;plant in southern Ukraine is now under Russian control. Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces are <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-13-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine">requiring approval</a> for any actions taken by the plant management, the agency reported in a March 6 statement. Additionally, Russian forces have cut off internet access and certain other connections with the outside world, making communication with the site’s operators difficult, the statement said.</p>



<p>If workers’ access to the site is restricted, that could jeopardize the safety of the plant in various ways, Lyman warned. “It’s important to recognize that even if a nuclear reactor is shut down … that core still requires cooling to prevent dangerous overheating of the fuel that could lead to fuel damage and potential radiological release.”</p>



<p>To ensure safety, workers must be able to apply any emergency measures needed to maintain cooling. In 2011, in the aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami, reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-struggles-control-earthquake-damaged-nuke-plant">endured explosions</a>, melting of reactor cores and the release of radioactive material when a loss of power prevented workers from maintaining cooling (<em>SN: 3/14/11</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, if the Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;plant’s operators are not allowed to freely come and go, “the personnel on-site might not have the opportunity to be relieved of their duties and this could lead, obviously, to fatigue compounded by the stress of working under duress,” Lyman said. Under such conditions, operators might be more likely to make mistakes, creating a situation ripe for dangerous nuclear accidents.</p>





<p>Lyman raised similar concerns over worker fatigue at the site of the 1986 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chernobyl-may-be-worst-nuclear-accident">Chernobyl accident</a> in Ukraine (<em>SN: 5/3/86</em>). On February 24, Russian forces occupied that site, which still demands a crew of workers to maintain and monitor it to prevent any further nuclear incidents. On March 7, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported that workers had been <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/chornobyl-npp-facilities-current-situation-7-march-2022-1300">on-site for 12 days without a staff rotation</a>.</p>



<p>Russian forces also shelled a nuclear facility at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a source of neutrons used for research, the nuclear regulator reported March 6. The radiation levels at the site <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/updated-information-neutron-source-site">are normal</a>, the regulator said March 7.</p>



<p>Overall, around half of Ukraine’s electricity comes from nuclear energy: The country has four active nuclear power plants, comprising 15 nuclear reactors. As of March 7, Russian forces appeared to be approaching another nuclear plant, the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, in Yuzhnoukrains’k, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-04-22/h_5b49ad14b52420ba1a080e51c6e63180">CNN reported</a> March 4. “The Ukrainian authorities have called for the establishment of what they call ‘safe zones’ around each nuclear power plant,” Lyman said. The issues faced by the nuclear sites “demonstrate how important that is.”</p>



<h4>Nuclear warfare</h4>



<p>While the danger of a nuclear accident is alarming enough on its own, the threat of nuclear weapons is adding to the worries.</p>



<p>The global unease was almost palpable after Vladimir Putin declared February 27 that he had ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to a state of high alert or “special combat readiness.” Nuclear threats are not to be taken lightly, especially those involving Russia and the United States, which together host the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>But, says physicist Frank von Hippel, an emeritus professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, the finger was already on the trigger even before Putin’s declaration.</p>



<p>Russia and the United States each have several hundred nuclear warheads in what’s called a “launch-on-warning” posture, in which a retaliatory barrage of nuclear missiles can be launched as soon as warning systems detect an enemy launch. You don’t get higher alert than that,” von Hippel says. “That’s routine, day-to-day, irrespective of international events.”</p>

<p>While it’s not clear exactly what Russia’s “special combat readiness” means in practice, von Hippel says that the country could ready additional weapons — for example by getting bombers loaded up at the end of runways. But the hair-trigger capacity for widespread nuclear destruction is already present.</p>



<p>Still, nuclear provocations like Putin’s matter, von Hippel says. “It does increase the danger of accidental nuclear war.” If an early-warning system misidentifies a nuclear attack, responders could initiate nuclear annihilation based on a misunderstanding. And in light of Russia’s heightened nuclear status, the response in the United States to a warning might be less skeptical. “The ground might already have been prepared psychologically … to expect that this is actually the real thing.”</p>



<p>In the 1980s, when nuclear arsenals were at their peak, the United States and the former Soviet Union together had about 70,000 warheads. Now, the entire world’s cache is closer to 10,000. But the numbers have stopped going down, says von Hippel, “and 10,000 is still enough to destroy civilization and cause billions of deaths.”</p>



<p>With the help of the American Physical Society, von Hippel and others formed the <a href="https://www.aps.org/policy/nuclear/index.cfm">Physicists Coalition for Nuclear Threat Reduction</a>, a group that includes around 650 physicists. The researchers lobby the U.S. Congress for changes in nuclear policy, for example, arguing for a “no-first-use” policy that would declare that U.S. nuclear weapons would be used only in response to another nuclear attack.</p>



<p>“The nuclear weapons era has just gone on too long,” von Hippel says. “We’ve been very lucky that there hasn’t been a nuclear war, but we can’t keep depending on luck given the consequences of all the destructive power that we’ve built up.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/">New options for posting a medRxiv preprint at PLOS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Starting today, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>, will <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">join the other PLOS journals publishing medical research</a> in giving submitting authors the option to have their manuscript forwarded to medRxiv to be considered for posting as a preprint. In offering this free service, we aim to make preprint posting simple and easy, giving researchers more flexibility in how they choose to communicate their science. Researchers, of course, also remain free to post to medRxiv or another preprint server prior to submitting.</p>



<p>The initial integration between PLOS and medRxiv, implemented earlier this year, has already received an enthusiastic response from our community. In less than two months, the authors of over 250 manuscripts submitted to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS NTD</em>s and <em>PLOS ONE</em> have elected to have their submissions sent on to medRxiv.<strong><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/#asterisk">*</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why. Preprints bring both individual and community benefits. Authors can use preprints as a tool to establish priority, broadcast results, seek feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications. More broadly, preprints support efficient and inclusive scientific communications. Publicly sharing a research manuscript before peer review surfaces results sooner, opening opportunities for collaboration and facilitating peer review.</p>



<p>The immediacy and accessibility of preprints, combined with expert checks that help to ensure responsible preprint posting, make medRxiv a particularly strong partner for journals like <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>, that prioritize openness and inclusion, technological innovation, and scientific rigor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="80" height="80" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/Madhukar-Pai-GPH_profile.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20141"></figure></div>



<p>&ldquo;During the pandemic, we have all seen the value of rapid communication of medical research via preprints. But we have also seen the need for careful and rigorous peer review in tackling bad science. By integrating medRxiv with <em>PLOS GPH</em>, we are supporting both goals &ndash; rapid sharing of research as well as thoughtful peer-review before publication.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ndash; Madhu Pai, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/Leo-Anthony-Celi_-PLOS-Digital-Health_profile.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20136" width="80" height="80"></figure></div>



<p>&ldquo;Among the core values of <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> is the promotion of ethically conducted, inclusive, and immediately accessible research. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, there is a critical need for the scientific community to be able to leverage information and communication technology to create and validate knowledge that is rapidly evolving. The use of preprint servers, most notably medRxiv, is integral to this vision of a near real-time iterative knowledge system, as they facilitate the immediate dissemination, public discussion, and open discourse of emerging studies. As the analyses iterate based on feedback from the research community, however, it remains important that they undergo formal peer review before entering into the permanent scientific record. With the collaboration between <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and medRxiv, we are able to synergistically achieve both goals&mdash;ensuring that practice-informing results are not delayed from preliminary contributions to the discourse by the inherent time delays of the publication process.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ndash; Leo Anthony Celi,&nbsp; Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em></p>



<p>Going forward, we&rsquo;ll continue to grow our open research offerings for authors across all PLOS journals, including integrations with community-supported preprint servers spanning a broader range of subject areas, and more tools and services to support research integrity, access, and inclusivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-deep-sea-mom-eggs-warm-water-garden-development">Some deep-sea octopuses aren’t the long-haul moms scientists thought they were</a></h4>

              
                <p>Octopuses living in the deep sea off the coast of California are breeding far faster than expected.</p>



<p>The animals lay their eggs near geothermal springs, and <a href="https://osm2022.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/3/details/4495">the warmer water speeds up embryonic development</a>, researchers report February 28 at the virtual 2022 Ocean Sciences Meeting. That reproductive sleight of hand means that the octopus moms brood for less than two years, instead of the estimated 12.</p>



<p>In 2018, scientists working off the coast of California discovered thousands of deep-sea octopuses (<em>Muusoctopus robustus</em>) congregated on a patch of seafloor about 3,200 meters below the surface. Many of the grapefruit-sized animals were females brooding clutches of eggs, leading researchers to dub the site the Octopus Garden.</p>





<p>But with water temperatures hovering around a frigid 1.6° Celsius, growth in this garden was predicted to be leisurely. In octopuses, embryonic development tends to slow down at low temperatures, says marine ecologist Jim Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif. “When you get really cold, down near zero, that’s when brood periods get really long.”</p>



<p>The record for the longest brood period of any animal, just over four years, is held by a different species of octopus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octomom-sets-egg-brooding-record">living in warmer water</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/14</em>). <em>M. robustus</em>, thriving in the chilly depths of the Octopus Garden, was therefore a serious contender to snatch that title, Barry says. “If you look at its predicted brood period at 1.6° C, it’s over 12 years.”</p>



<p>To verify what would be a record-setting stint of motherhood, Barry and his colleagues repeatedly visited the Octopus Garden from 2019 to 2021 using a remotely operated vehicle. The team trained cameras at the octopus eggs, which resemble white fingers, to monitor their rate of development. With one of the submersible’s robotic arms, the researchers also gently nudged dozens of octopuses aside and measured the water temperature in their nests.</p>



<p>The team found that relatively warm water — up to 10.5° C — bathed all the egg clutches. The female octopuses are preferentially laying their eggs in streams of geothermally heated water, the researchers realized. That discovery was a tip-off that these animals are not the long-haul moms people thought them to be, Barry says. “We’re virtually certain these animals are breeding far more rapidly than you’d expect.”</p>

<p>Based on observations of the developing eggs, Barry and colleagues calculated that the moms brooded for only about 600 days, or about a year and a half. That is much faster than predicted, says Jeffrey Drazen, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who was not involved in the research. “They’re cutting a huge amount of time off of their parental care period.”</p>



<p>There is also an evolutionary advantage to seeking out warmer water: Shorter brood periods mean that fewer eggs are likely to be gobbled up by predators. And these octopuses seem to know that, Barry says. “We believe they’re exploiting that thermal energy to improve reproductive success.”</p>



<p>Only a few other marine animals, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group">icefish in Antarctica’s Weddell Sea</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/22</em>), are known to seek out warmer conditions when breeding. But there are probably other species that do the same, Drazen says. The challenge is finding them and their breeding grounds in the vast expanse of the deep ocean. “I imagine that as we keep looking, we will keep finding really interesting sites that are important to certain species,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tarantula-bamboo-bambootula-thailand-biology">This newfound tarantula is the first known to make its home in bamboo</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meet “bambootula.” This newfound tarantula gets its nickname from the tall, stiff-shafted grass in which it makes a home in northern Thailand.</p>



<p><em>Taksinus bambus</em>, as the spider is officially known, “is the world’s first tarantula with a biology tied to bamboo,” says arachnologist Narin Chomphuphuang of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.</p>



<p>Bamboo stems, or culms, give the tarantula ready-made burrows and nests. But <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/76876/"><em>T. bambus</em> lacks the tools to bore into culms</a>, so it relies on natural forces or animals such as borer beetles and rodents to create openings, Chomphuphuang and colleagues report January 4 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. Once inside, bambootula builds a silk “retreat tube” that keeps the spider secure and helps it move around easily.<br><br>Chomphuphuang was introduced to the tarantula by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7NsgZvnbBs">JoCho Sippawat</a>, a popular wildlife YouTuber who discovered it when cutting bamboo in the forest near his home. Chomphuphuang’s team confirmed the spider belonged to a new genus and species based on the size and shape of its reproductive organs. It’s the first time in 104 years that anyone has turned up a new genus of tarantula in Asia, the researchers say.</p>

<p>Habitat type also was key to confirming the spider’s novelty, Chomphuphuang says. Other Asian tree-dwelling tarantulas are found in habitats unlike where bambootula showed up — a bamboo forest about 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>



<p>Cornell University arachnologist Linda Rayor isn’t too surprised by the find. So far, some 49,000 species of spiders are known to science and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-tarantula-black">new ones are frequently discovered</a> (<em>SN: 2/4/16</em>). Researchers estimate that 1 in every 3 to 5 spider species alive has yet to be found and named. Anyone can find a new spider, she says, including “local people looking and exploring and watching things.”</p>



<p>But “few people realize how much wildlife in Thailand is still undocumented,” Chomphuphuang says. Forests now cover only about one-third of the country. It’s important for scientists to keep looking for new species in such areas, he says, so the animals can be studied — and, where needed, protected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/07/here-are-the-personality-traits-shared-by-famous-psychopaths/">Here are the personality traits shared by famous psychopaths</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What <em>is </em>psychopathy? For a concept that gets endless attention, there’s surprisingly little agreement. Various models have been put forward over the years. Robert Hare’s <a href="https://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/store/ukassessments/en/hare/Hare-Psychopathy-Checklist-Revised-%7C-Second-Edition/p/P100009043.html">Psychopathy Checklist &#8211; Revised</a> has been particularly influential. But it, too, has been questioned, with debate centring on the nature of the fundamental traits that together make someone a psychopath.</p>



<p>In a bid for clarity, Cristina Crego at Longwood University and Thomas A. Widiger at the University of Kentucky decided to look for shared traits in six people, real and fictional, who have been identified as psychopathic. They present their work in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-28155-001">new paper</a> in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment</em>. Their list includes a few names that might be come as a surprise. But this turned out to be an advantage — the pair feel that it drew them closer to understanding which are the core traits of psychopathy, and which are red herrings.</p>



<span id="more-45627"></span>



<p>This is the list:</p>



<p>Theodore (Ted) Bundy: a serial killer who admitted to at least 30 murders in the 1970s. Hare reports that Bundy described himself as “the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet”.</p>



<p>Clyde Barrow: a man who murdered a long list of people, including members of the public and prison guards; also said to be charming and engaging.</p>



<p>Bernie Madoff: a “snake in a suit”, he was responsible for what’s regarded as the largest Ponzi scheme and financial fraud in US history.</p>



<p>Chuck Yeager: a highly successful US test pilot; he had what Tom Wolfe famously called “the right stuff” — in particular, fearlessness. Various researchers have suggested that Yeager might have been psychopathic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus:</p>



<p>James Bond: there are claims that he, too, is a (fictional) psychopath</p>



<p>Sherlock Holmes: fearless, ruthless in his pursuit of his goals… psychopathic? Some researchers think so, the authors note.</p>



<p>Yeager, Bond and Holmes are also all seen as heroes. But, as Crego and Widiger add, it has been claimed that “the hero and psychopath are twigs from the same branch”.</p>



<p>The pair’s approach was pretty straightforward. Rather than taking traits that have been associated with psychopathy and checking to see if they matched the personalities of purported psychopaths, they took the reverse approach. They prepared 3- to 5-page-long case histories for each of the six individuals. Online participants read these, then used three different rating forms to score them on a very comprehensive range of traits — then the researchers looked for any patterns in the results. The participants were not told that the purpose of the study was to investigate psychopathy (though no doubt many guessed this).</p>



<p>The first form consisted of 39 traits from Hare’s psychopathy checklist, and also traits from other psychopathy measures, such as Paulhus’s Self-Report Psychopathy-III. These traits included &#8220;lack of remorse&#8221;, &#8220;cruel&#8221; and &#8220;arrogant&#8221;, for example. Definitions were provided for each one.</p>



<p>The second form consisted of 12 traits identified by psychopathy pioneer Hervey Cleckley, but not included in the first form. These included &#8220;good intelligence&#8221; and an absence of delusions (again, definitions were given).</p>



<p>The third form contained 30 items from the Five Factor model of personality. This was included because some researchers argue that psychopathy can be understood as a mixture of scores at the extreme end of normal on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness.</p>



<p>The results led Crego and Widiger to identify eight traits as cropping up time and again. These were: low vulnerability, low self-consciousness, low anxiousness, fearlessness, boldness, assertiveness, dominance and excitement-seeking. However, the traits that really stood out and that overlapped in the cases of Bundy, Barrow and Madoff — the most undisputed psychopaths — were ones that related to antagonism. These included callousness, manipulativeness, dishonest, arrogance and cruelty.</p>



<p>In fact, Yeager, Bond and Holmes didn’t show these antagonistic traits, and didn’t meet traditional criteria for psychopathy. Instead, the authors suggest they may have been mistakenly identified as psychopathic in the past simply because of their fearlessness and boldness. And while these traits are found in psychopaths, they are not exclusive to them. “From this perspective, the hero and psychopath may not represent twigs from the same branch but entirely independent branches,” the pair writes.</p>



<p>Interestingly, low conscientiousness has been identified by other researchers as a key psychopathic trait. But Madoff scored highly in many aspects of conscientiousness, including striving for achievement and being competent. So either Madoff isn’t a psychopath — or low conscientiousness is not a key psychopathic trait.</p>



<p>There are various limitations to the work. One is that the &#8220;psychopath&#8221; is a hugely popular concept, featuring often in the media and in fiction. It’s certainly possible that the participants not only guessed the purpose of the study, but that their ideas about psychopathy coloured their ratings. Also, of the six individuals, only three would be widely seen as &#8220;obvious&#8221; psychopaths — and two were of course fictional. Their relevance to understanding actual psychopaths is debatable. It’s also hard to see how this particular work will change the mind of anyone who thinks that Holmes and Bond, say, <em>are</em> psychopaths.</p>



<p>Still, the results will feed into the ongoing argument about which traits are core to psychopathy. According to this work: traits relating to antagonism, yes; fearlessness, boldness, and level of conscientiousness, no. </p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/EvT-in-field-e1645816701889-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><em>Welcome to our </em><strong><em>SDG Editorial Board Members</em></strong><em> blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members’. </em></p>
<hr />
<p>I am a medical sociologist working in the fields of maternity care, public health, and global health. For the past 13 years I have been Professor of Reproductive Health Research at Bournemouth University, in the south of England. Before that I spent 17 years at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland as Senior Lecturer, and subsequently, Reader in Public Health. My work is based in the UK and in low-income countries, especially in South Asia. All my work, or nearly all my work, is interdisciplinary in nature. Often, I bring a sociological or social science perspective to a team focusing on health, health promotion, or health services research. Because of my involvement in many different research teams my work relates to quite a few UN SDGs. However, the main SDGs for me are probably 3, 5, and 17. SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-being’ is at the core of my work as sociologist of health and illness, closely followed by SDG 5 ‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’ which is key in all health fields, and especially in my post as Professor of Reproductive Health Research studying maternity and midwifery.</p>
<p>The first project I would like to highlight focusing on SDG 3 is an interdisciplinary project, studying the effects of Nepal becoming federal republic in 2015 on its health system. This ‘<a href="https://www.nepalfederalhealthsystem.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Nepal Federal Health System Project</a>’ is UK-funded by the MRC (Medical Research Council), the Wellcome Trust and DFID (Department for International Development) under the Health Systems Research Initiative grant. This exciting project is collaboration between researchers at four UK universities, including Bournemouth University, and two organizations in Kathmandu, Nepal: Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Science and PHASE Nepal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Strengthening midwifery education to international standards is a key step to improving quality of care and reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central focus of the project is on health policies, clearly linking it to SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, but health is of course connected to almost all other goals and therefore demands a multi-sectoral systems approach. In Nepal, social and health inequities, environmental pollution, large-scale labor migration, disaster planning, the gap between rural and urban populations, and many more societal problems require health systems thinking. We know that general policies and non-health interventions can have health implications at levels of society, from the local community to the national level. This project had a slow start as it coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which seriously restricted both international travel between the UK and Nepal and local travel in Nepal.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to highlight my contribution to SDG 17 ‘Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development’ in this blog. This is perhaps a less obvious choice. Many of our projects run in collaboration with partners in low-income countries, including strengthening partnerships and building capacity in-country as a key element. The Nepal Federal Health System Project incorporated elements of staff and organizational development for our partners in Nepal. These training sessions to date have included sessions on, for example, systematic reviewing and writing and publishing in English-language journals.<img class="size-medium wp-image-12783 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-300x224.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-768x575.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-640x479.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier.jpg 1013w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The second project in this blog highlights the importance of midwives in ensuring safe, woman-centered maternity care. Nepal, like many low-income countries, still does not have enough appropriately skilled midwives. Strengthening midwifery education to international standards is a key step to improving quality of care and reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.</p>
<p>Our Bournemouth University team, supported by midwifery colleagues at <a href="https://www.du.se/en?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Dalarna University</a> from Sweden, helped develop midwifery education in Nepal in a project funded by GIZ (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit), the German equivalent of DFID 2019-2021. In Nepal there is a shortage of appropriately trained and educated midwives to teach newly established undergraduate midwifery courses. Our project involves developing a framework for providing academic support to nurse/midwife educators with the aim to enhance their midwifery knowledge and skills. It also involves designing, in collaboration with key stakeholders in Nepal, a bridging program to upskill current maternity workers so they can apply for their midwifery license to practice. This project clearly links to SDG 3, 4 and 17. We faced the same problems as in the project above, that the COVID-19 pandemic started shortly after the start of the project. This seriously hindered our ability to travel to Nepal and deliver clinical training. Some training we managed to do by Zoom but midwifery training needs hands-on, face-to-face delivery.</p>
<p>COVID-19, the disease as well as associated restrictions and lockdowns, will have affected the progress towards achieving the SDGs. My worry is that some will use the pandemic as an excuse for not achieving as much as planned. As researchers we must consider the benefits as well as the limitations of working remotely. We have realized that many research meetings, training exercises and conferences can be conducted online without people have to travel across the globe, thus reducing our carbon footprint as academics. I believe that what we have learnt during the pandemic should continue to be part of our working practice.</p>

<h4>Defining boundaries</h4>



<p><em>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe is the first spacecraft to enter the sun’s atmosphere, crossing the boundary between interplanetary space and solar territory called the Alfvén critical surface, <strong>Lisa Grossman </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">NASA probe is the first to visit the sun</a>” (</em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 10<em>).</em></p>



<p>The probe’s solar visit allowed researchers to determine that the Alfvén critical surface lies about 13 million kilometers above the sun’s surface, <strong>Grossman</strong> reported. Reader <strong>Jeff Engel </strong>wondered what is considered the sun’s “surface,” given that the star is made of plasma and doesn’t have a distinct, solid surface.</p>





<p>In this context, the sun’s “surface” refers to its photosphere, from which most of the sun’s photons are emitted, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. The photosphere doesn’t have a solid surface either. Instead, it consists of a layer of gas and plasma about a few hundred kilometers thick.</p>



<h4>Rising seas</h4>



<p><em>The ice shelf holding Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier back from the sea could collapse within five years, raising the risk of dramatic sea level rise, <strong>Carolyn Gramling </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">Ice shelf could collapse within 5 years</a>” (</em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Gramling</strong> wrote that if the whole glacier were to slide into the ocean, it would raise Earth’s sea levels by 65 centimeters, or more than two feet. Reader<strong> Jim Schmitz</strong> wanted to know if water flowing into low-lying areas could possibly reduce the potential sea level rise.</p>



<p>Actual measurements of sea level rise do and will vary from place to place around the globe for various reasons, including expanding seawater, postglacial rebound, the rotation of Earth and sinking lands. The estimated sea level rise of 65 centimeters takes these factors into account, but none of them change the big picture, <strong>Gramling</strong> says.</p>



<p>As for already low-lying coastal areas, they won’t be able to disperse the rising waters; they’ll just become inundated themselves, <strong>Gramling</strong> says. “Melting of a major piece of an ice sheet will drown out everything else, pun intended.”</p>

<h3>Imagine this</h3>



<p>Recent experiments (one shown below) suggest that a quantum physics theory based only on “real” numbers fails to explain the real world, <strong>Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-imaginary-numbers-math-reality">Physics requires imaginary numbers</a>” (<em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 14</em>). Twitter user <strong>@DwightWebster45</strong> mused on the findings: “The closer we look, the more complexity we find.”</p>

<h4>Ancient landscapers</h4>



<p><em>Neandertals’ campfires, hunting and other activities may have helped transform an area in Europe from forest to open grassland around 125,000 years ago, making the hominids the first known to dramatically impact their environment, <strong>Bruce Bower</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-first-hominid-modify-environment-forest-grassland">Neandertals shaped European terrain</a>” (</em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Morten Lindhard</strong> asked how much of that European landscape was opened with Neandertal-made fire, rather than by wild grazing animals.</p>



<p>Researchers don’t know for sure the percentage of the landscape transformed by fire,<strong> Bower</strong> says. A considerable area of the study site — which borders what is now a 24-hectare ancient lake basin and a nearby smaller basin in Germany — appears to have changed from forest to grassland. Extensive evidence suggests that ancient fires were the primary driver of this change, <strong>Bower </strong>says.</p>



<p>Several readers wondered if some of the Neandertal-made fires that cleared the forest may have been spread accidentally.</p>



<p>Scientists currently aren’t able to distinguish archaeologically between one or a few large fires that spread accidentally or many smaller, controlled campfires, <strong>Bower</strong> says. Signs of numerous campfires at the study site over a period of around 2,000 years suggest the latter. But there is always some uncertainty when reconstructing ancient behavior from archaeological evidence, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-arent-we-listening-to-science">Why aren’t we listening to what science is telling us?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over the last 170 years, climate science has evolved from a collection of observations and hypotheses to as close as we’ve got to a crystal ball, revealing what lies ahead for Earth and those who dwell here.</p>



<p>In this issue’s cover story, contributing correspondent Alexandra Witze details the remarkable story of scientists’ efforts to learn how<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact"> increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere might affect our planet</a>. It’s a saga that starts back in the 1850s, when Eunice Newton Foote, a women’s rights activist and amateur scientist, devised an experiment showing that carbon dioxide heats up more quickly than regular air. As so often happens in science, other people were asking similar questions about the planet, climate and heat. But since our planet’s climate systems are astonishingly intricate, these have not been easy questions to answer. It wasn’t until 1938 that the burning of fossil fuels was linked to rising temperatures worldwide, and not until the late 1950s that scientists showed that atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing, and that human activities, including fossil fuel burning and land use changes, are to blame.</p>



<p>Now the relatively new field of attribution science is showing us how climate change is fueling extreme weather, including the 2021 extreme heat wave in western North America. But as Witze notes, leaders in government and business worldwide have largely failed to act to prevent even more extreme consequences.</p>





<p>There’s good reason to be furious at the fossil fuel companies and politicians who have invested vast effort into denying the legitimacy of climate science, thus delaying the coordinated efforts required to safeguard our future on Earth. But few of us are blameless.</p>



<p>My life is entwined with fossil fuels, from the gas stove I just used to make a cup of tea to the airplane I’ll take to visit my dad next week. His life, I realize, mirrors a century of change. As a child in a Pennsylvania coal town, he traveled by horse and wagon and read by kerosene lamps. He took a bus to college, shipped off to the South Pacific in World War II and later flew worldwide for business and pleasure. Now retired in Oregon, he has had to evacuate due to wildfires, and he suffered through last summer’s 115° Fahrenheit “heat dome.”</p>



<p>Humans have been ingeniously adapting fossil fuels for millennia. The bricks in Mesopotamian ziggurats were set with bitumen from oil seeps, and people in China were drilling oil wells in the fourth century. It’s time to apply the same ingenuity, industriousness and attention to inventing a world where we can flourish without having to rely on burning fossil fuels.</p>



<p>Last month we got a letter from 14-year-old Nico Santin. He had read an article in<em> Science News </em>on how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal">seabirds are threatened by ocean heat waves</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/22, p. 15</em>). Nico lives in Hawaii, and he writes eloquently on how essential seabirds are to his island home. “Most of Hawaii’s native plants would not have been there without the help of birds,” he writes. “It would be devastating if seabirds native to Hawaii would starve and possibly go extinct because of rising temperatures.” It’s time for us all, he says, to take practical steps to make sure that doesn’t happen. I’m with Nico.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-coli-viral-grenade-bacteria-dna-toxin-colibactin">Some E. coli set off viral grenades inside nearby bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bacteria can trigger unexploded viral grenades in neighboring bacteria’s DNA.</p>



<p>Certain <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria, including some that live in human intestines, make a chemical called colibactin. That <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04444-3">chemical awakens dormant viruses inside nearby bacteria</a>, sometimes leading to their destruction, researchers report February 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>This type of biological warfare among bacteria hasn’t been described before. “It’s an interesting strategy, and it’s also a dangerous strategy,” says Heather Hendrickson, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, who was not involved in the work.</p>





<p>Colibactin producers must creep up on their bacterial enemies and trigger the unexploded ordinance hiding in the enemies’ DNA. Those grenades are prophages — bacteria-infecting viruses that have inserted themselves into their hosts’ DNA, where they hide out harmless and dormant until something triggers their awakening. That something, in this case, is DNA damage caused by colibactin.</p>



<p>When colibactin dings DNA, a bacterial repair system called the SOS response kicks in, chemical biologist Emily Balskus and colleagues found. “What many phages have done is to tap into that response,” says Balskus, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Harvard University.</p>



<p>“It’s a signal for them to move out of this dormant lifestyle and awaken to kill their host and move on to find a new host,” she says. Once phages wake up, they replicate and burst out of the host cell, destroying it.</p>



<p>But once these viral grenades go off, they can infect other bacteria, potentially exposing the attacking bacteria and other close-by microbes to biological shrapnel.</p>



<p>Humans might also get caught in the cross fire. Researchers already knew that colibactin can cause damage to human DNA that may lead to colon cancer. But why the bacteria would use the chemical against people wasn’t known.</p>



<p>The new research suggests that <em>E. coli</em> may not be producing colibactin to assault its human hosts, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">as a countermeasure</a> against other microbes, Hendrickson says (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). “It’s easy to forget that there’s this continual conversation and warfare going on between bacteria, and we might not be the focus of their activities.”</p>



<p>Among bacteria, colibactin isn’t usually a lethal weapon. In most bacteria that Balskus and her colleagues examined, colibactin caused DNA damage, but the bacteria were able to repair the wounds. That may be because colibactin is an unstable chemical that quickly degrades before it can break enough DNA to do irreparable harm, Balskus says. Some bacteria also make other chemicals that defuse colibactin before it can damage DNA, her team found. Only bacteria that have unexploded prophages in their DNA and no other defenses were vulnerable to colibactin-producing bacteria in laboratory dishes.</p>



<p>Because colibactin decays quickly, “it suggests this is a very short-range communication,” says Michael Dougherty, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. “Maybe it could have an effect when bacteria are forming biofilms where you have trillions of bacteria stacked on top of each other.”</p>



<p>Colibactin may not be the only factor involved in exploding neighboring bacteria, says Dougherty’s University of Florida colleague Christian Jobin. Balskus’ team did not demonstrate that colibactin alone could detonate prophages. Perhaps something else about the colibactin-producing bacterium’s presence is required to kick off the fireworks, he suggests.</p>



<p>The researchers don’t yet know whether colibactin can trigger prophages when bacteria are in their natural habitats, such as human and other animal intestines. And perhaps awakening the viruses is an accident, Balskus speculates.</p>



<p>“Maybe [colibactin] didn’t really evolve to kill. Maybe its primary ecological function involves doing something else,” she says. What that might be is a mystery that Balskus and her colleagues are working to solve.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">Astronomers may not have found a sign of the universe’s first stars after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new study casts a haze over a hint of the universe’s first glimmers of starlight.</p>



<p>In 2018, researchers claimed that a subtle signature in radio waves from early in the universe’s history had revealed the era when the first stars switched on, known as the cosmic dawn. But the first experiment to test that study’s conclusions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01610-5">found no sign of those early stars</a>, scientists report February 28 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Just after the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was a hot stew of matter. Stars probably didn’t flicker on until at least 100 million years later — a poorly understood era of the cosmos. Finding signs of the first beams of starlight would flesh out the cosmic origin story. So the 2018 claim of pinpointing those earliest gleams, from the EDGES experiment in the Australian outback, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-born-big-bang">caused an astronomical hubbub</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/18</em>).</p>





<p>“It definitely completely excited our whole community with this fascinating result,” says radio astronomer Saurabh Singh of the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India.</p>



<p>The researchers reported detecting a dip across particular wavelengths of radio waves, a sign of light from the first stars interacting with surrounding hydrogen gas. But the result quickly raised skepticism, because the dip was deeper than expected. To know whether the hint of the first starlight was real, scientists would need to make more measurements.</p>



<p>Singh and colleagues did just that with the Shaped Antenna Measurement of the Background Radio Spectrum 3, or SARAS 3. Similar to EDGES, the experiment uses an antenna to pick up radio waves. But SARAS 3 has a different design from EDGES, with a differently shaped antenna. And SARAS 3 is designed to float atop a lake. “That gives us a very distinctive advantage,” Singh says.</p>



<p>On Earth, radio waves come from a variety of sources, which must be carefully accounted for to reveal the subtler signal from the cosmic dawn. Misunderstanding those other sources of radio waves could lead to an unaccounted-for experimental error that might give incorrect results.</p>



<p>In particular, experiments on land must contend with radio waves emitted from the ground, which are difficult to estimate due to the complex, layered nature of soil. When the antenna is atop a lake, it’s easier to estimate what kinds of radio waves come from the uniform water below. Data taken from two lakes in India revealed no sign of the dip.</p>



<p>The new study “highlights just how difficult this measurement is,” says physicist H. Cynthia Chiang of&nbsp;McGill University in Montreal. It’s uncomfortable that the two studies disagree, she says, but notes that the disagreement “isn&#8217;t quite enough to make any definitive conclusions at this point.”</p>



<p>And some of the same types of experimental issues that may affect EDGES could also affect SARAS 3, says experimental cosmologist Judd Bowman of Arizona State University in Tempe, a member of the EDGES team. “We still have more work ahead to reach the final outcome.”</p>



<p>An improved version of EDGES will be deployed later this year, and the SARAS 3 team has additional deployments planned. Other experiments are also working on similar measurements. Those tests may finally illuminate the universe’s transition from darkness to light.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Searching for meaning is something many of us experience throughout our lives: finding something to strive for that gives shape, direction, and purpose to the things we choose to do. For some, this meaning is religious; some political; some interpersonal. And having a sense of meaning can bring us happiness (or, if we lack meaning, unhappiness).</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/RP4003.pdf">new study</a> to be published in <em>Emotion</em> looks at the relationship between meaning and happiness in the context of financial resources. Rhia Catapano from the University of Toronto and colleagues find that meaning is a far weaker predictor of happiness for rich people than poorer people — suggesting economic resources can impact how we experience meaning.</p>



<span id="more-45610"></span>



<p>The team analysed data from over 500,000 people across 123 countries. The first study used data from a daily poll of US residents collected between 2013 and 2015. Wellbeing was tracked using measures of positive affect — whether, during the day before they were surveyed, participants had smiled or laughed a lot, experienced a lot of enjoyment, or experienced a lot of happiness.</p>



<p>Meaning was measured through a daily &#8220;purpose index&#8221;, which explored the extent to which participants felt that they like what they do every day and are motivated to achieve their goals. (Though this may be more accurately described as a measure of purpose than meaning, the team note that the terms are somewhat interchangeable in this part of the study). Finally, income levels were assessed.</p>



<p>The results showed that the correlation between meaning and happiness was strongest among those in lower income brackets. But as income levels increased, the correlation became weaker: in other words, having a sense of meaning or purpose was not as good a predictor of happiness among those with a higher income. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The second study looked at worldwide data. Happiness was measured using the same questions as in the first study, while meaning was measured using the single question: “Do you feel your life has an important purpose or meaning?”. Again, the strength of the relationship between meaning and happiness depended on participants’ income: meaning had a greater influence on happiness for those on lower incomes compared to those in higher brackets.</p>



<p>In the final study, French participants indicated the extent to which they felt they led a purposeful and meaningful life and how much they considered themselves a happy person. Finally, rather than using specific income brackets, they placed themselves on a &#8220;social ladder&#8221; representing where they stand in society with regard to wealth, education, and career. The results from this study replicated the first two.</p>



<p>So, overall, meaning and happiness had a stronger relationship in those with fewer resources than those with more. This might be the case because richer individuals have more access to other sources of happiness — many of which will be external, like lack of stress or community. Thus, a focus on an internal sense of satisfaction, purpose or meaning is less important. Future research could explore the relationship more fully, and look at how happiness impacts meaning as well as vice versa.</p>



<p>The team also notes the higher levels of depression and anxiety in people in lower income brackets and suggests that focusing on meaning may be one way of improving mental health. It’s crucial not to avoid the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/austerity-and-inequality-fuelling-mental-illness-says-top-un-envoy">structural factors</a> involved here, however: designing interventions that focus on meaning are not going to alleviate systemic injustices many people on low incomes face.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">How Russia’s war in Ukraine hinders space research and exploration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Space exploration may seem like a faraway endeavor from Earth’s surface, but events on the ground ripple into space. The Russian war on Ukraine is no exception.</p>



<p>From a rocket launch system to a rover set to explore Mars, a wide range of space missions is facing postponements or cancelations due to escalating tensions on the ground in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion into Ukraine on February 24. The European Union, United States and others have imposed sanctions on Russia; Russia, as a result, is continually changing and canceling its space-related plans. The shifts are having an impact on everything from international collaborations to missions that rely on Russian rockets to get to space.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at some of those projects.</p>





<h4>ExoMars rover</h4>



<p>The ExoMars mission is a partnership between the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. This is a two-part mission to Mars consisting of an orbiter and a rover. The orbiter has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/exomars-mission-set-arrive-red-planet-october-19">at the Red Planet since late 2016</a>, but the Rosalind Franklin rover was supposed to launch this September (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>).</p>



<p>“The sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,” the European Space Agency, or ESA, said <a href="https://www.esa.int/Newsroom/Press_Releases/ESA_statement_regarding_cooperation_with_Russia_following_a_meeting_with_Member_States_on_28_February_2022">in a February 28 statement</a> in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Due to Earth’s and Mars’ orbital geometry, the most direct trajectory for a spacecraft from our planet to Mars repeats every two years, and that launch window remains open for less than two weeks. The ExoMars rover, which will look for signs of past life, was originally to launch in 2020, but due to the pandemic and technical issues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-exomars-coronavirus-technical-issues-delay">it slipped to 2022</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>). Now it’s at risk of slipping again to 2024.</p>



<h4>The eROSITA telescope</h4>



<p>Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma is a space-based X-ray observatory, run jointly by Germany and Russia, that has been mapping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xray-map-sky-erosita-telescope-milky-way">the large-scale structure of the universe</a> for the last two and a half years (<em>SN: 7/8/20).</em> The probe’s main telescope, eROSITA, has discovered hundreds of celestial objects, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-glow-cow-supernova-explosion-black-hole-neutron-star">a bizarre stellar explosion known as a “cow”</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). On February 26, the Germans <a href="https://twitter.com/eROSITA_SRG/status/1498699903480049670">placed eROSITA into safe mode</a> as an action to “freeze co-operation with Russia,” according to a statement from SRG leadership at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a standard, reversible, operation mode of the telescope, in which we do not take data, but keep the vital subsystems on,” says Andrea Merloni, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, also in Garching, and eROSITA’s project scientist. He declined to comment on any other aspect of the mission or collaboration with Russia.</p>



<p>The Russian News Agency TASS reported March 1 that Roscosmos intends to estimate the financial loss of that safe-mode action and other European space-related sanctions, and the Russian space agency will then bill “the European side” of the projects.</p>



<p>ESA, meanwhile, is “assessing the consequences on each of our ongoing programmes conducted in cooperation with the Russian state space agency,” the agency said in its February 28 statement.</p>



<h4>Navigation satellites</h4>



<p>In response to international sanctions against Russia, the head of Roscosmos announced February 26 that the agency was <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rogozin/status/1497456152442978305">suspending cooperation</a> with the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, and withdrawing its dozens of employees from the site. Several space missions were set to launch from this location via a Russian Soyuz rocket in the next year, including a pair of European navigation satellites in early April.</p>



<p>These satellites would have joined with the already-launched two dozen that make up the Galileo navigational system, the European answer to the United States’ GPS system. Two additional Galileo satellites are also in orbit, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-oops-reaffirms-einstein-theory-gravity">they were placed incorrectly</a> and instead focus on science and search and rescue (<em>SN: 12/10/18</em>).</p>



<h4>OneWeb internet network</h4>



<p>The U.K. company OneWeb, which is building a space-based internet network with hundreds of low-Earth satellites, is also facing a launch postponement.</p>



<p>A Soyuz rocket was scheduled to send up a few dozen OneWeb satellites March 4, one of a series of launches aimed at completing the network in 2022. But in the early hours of March 2, the head of Roscosmos tweeted <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1498967071727706114">the space agency wouldn’t launch the satellites</a> without a guarantee from the company that they wouldn’t be used for military purposes. He also demanded the U.K. government sell its share of the mission, which it has refused to do.</p>



<h4>Venera-D mission to Venus</h4>



<p>The Russian-Ukraine war has also affected U.S. space activities, but to a lesser extent than its impact on its European counterparts. NASA has relationships with several commercial partners, so the agency relies less on Roscosmos. But NASA is still feeling some effects.</p>



<p>For instance, in retaliation to U.S. sanctions, the head of Roscosmos tweeted on February 26 that NASA’s participation in <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1497473032813690884">the Russian-led Venera-D mission to Venus would be “inappropriate.</a>” This mission will include an orbiter, lander and surface station, and it will focus on understanding Venus’s former and present habitability.</p>



<p>However, Venera-D won’t launch until late this decade, and NASA has been involved only in some planning groups. The U.S. space agency already has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two of its own Venus missions</a> in the works (<em>SN: 6/02/21</em>).</p>



<h4>International Space Station</h4>



<p>While many areas of cooperation in space with Russia are fraying, the International Space Station collaboration so far remains unchanged. “NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station,” NASA public affairs officer Joshua Finch, at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, said in an e-mailed statement.</p>



<p>Currently, there are two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one ESA astronaut aboard the station. Later this month, a Russian Soyuz capsule is set to return the two cosmonauts and one of the NASA astronauts to Earth, landing in Kazakhstan as scheduled, Finch said.</p>



<p>However, during a March 1 NASA Advisory Council meeting, Wayne Hale, a former NASA associate administrator, recommended the U.S. space agency consider contingencies in case Russia no longer collaborates on the space station. At the same meeting the following day, former U.S. representative Jane Harman recommended that NASA think about what cooperation with Russia will look like going forward.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Other science collaborations at risk</h4>



<p>Space research is not the only area of science experiencing uncertainty due to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Here are two other scientific collaborations showing signs of strain.</p>



<p><strong>Nuclear fusion:</strong> In Southern France, an international group of physicists is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">constructing ITER</a>, which will be the world’s largest plasma physics experiment to produce energy the same way stars do at their cores (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). Seven partner members — including the European Union, Russia and the United States — lead the project and develop the equipment used in the experiment. No one yet knows what the effects on ITER will be because this is a <a href="https://twitter.com/iterorg/status/1498944207024795650">“situation without precedent,”</a> the ITER organization said in a March 2 tweet. <em>— Liz Kruesi</em></p>



<p><strong>Arctic research:</strong>  Since the Arctic Council was established in 1996, its eight full members — including Russia and the United States — have forged agreements on issues from oil spill cleanup plans to scientific cooperation, leading to nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, <a href="https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/arctic-council-nominated-nobel-peace-prize">including in 2022</a>. It’s not yet clear what impacts the war will have on this cooperation, or on other international Arctic efforts, such as U.S.-Russia joint patrols in the Bering Sea and an E.U.-Russia plan to retrieve sunken nuclear submarines from Russian waters. <em>— Carolyn Gramling</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dopamine-mice-rem-sleep-dream">A hit of dopamine sends mice into dreamland</a></h4>

              
                <p>A quick surge of dopamine shifts mice into a dreamy stage of sleep.</p>



<p>In the rodents’ brains, the chemical messenger <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1987">triggers rapid-eye-movement sleep</a>, or REM, researchers report in the March 4 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>During a night’s sleep, people and other animals cycle between phases called non-REM sleep and REM, a sleep stage that usually comes with vivid dreams. But what causes those transitions is mysterious, says neurologist and sleep researcher Thomas Scammell of Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. These new results are some of the first to show a trigger for the shifts, Scammell says. Understanding these transitions in more detail could ultimately point to ways to treat sleep disorders in people. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Certain nerve cells residing in a part of the mouse brain called the ventral tegmental area can pump out dopamine, a molecule that has been linked to pleasure, movement and learning, among other things. These cells can deliver dopamine to the amygdalae, two almond-shaped structures deep in the brain that are closely tied to emotions.</p>



<p>Using a molecular sensor that can tell exactly when and where dopamine is released, neuroscientist Takeshi Sakurai from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and colleagues saw that dopamine levels rose in the amygdalae just before mice shifted from non-REM sleep to REM sleep.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers forced the mice into the REM phase by controlling those dopamine-producing nerve cells using lasers and genetic techniques — a method called optogenetics. Compelled with light, the nerve cells released dopamine in the amygdalae while mice were in non-REM sleep. The mice then shifted into REM sleep sooner than they typically did, after an average of about two minutes compared with about eight minutes for mice that weren’t prompted to release dopamine. Stimulating these cells every half hour increased the mice’s total amount of REM sleep.</p>



<p>Additional experiments suggest that these dopamine-making nerve cells may also be involved in aspects of narcolepsy. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-gone-awry">sudden loss of muscle tone</a>, called cataplexy, shares features with REM sleep and can accompany narcolepsy (<em>SN: 10/9/10</em>). Stimulating these dopamine-making nerve cells while mice were awake caused the mice to stop moving and fall directly into REM sleep.</p>



<p>The results help clarify a trigger for REM in mice; whether a similar thing happens in people isn’t known, Sakurai says. Earlier studies have found that nerve cells in people’s amygdalae are active during REM sleep, he says, hinting at a role for the brain structure.</p>



<p>Many questions remain. Drugs that change dopamine levels in people don’t seem to have big effects on REM sleep and cataplexy, Scammell says. But these drugs affect the whole brain, he points out, and it’s possible that they are just not selective enough. “My overall question about this is, ‘How can we translate this to humans?’” Scammell says.</p>
