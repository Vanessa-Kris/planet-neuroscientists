One of these pledges was to ensure that 80% of drink containers include labels detailing alcohol content, daily intake guidance and warning against drinking during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Whilst these pledges may be well intentioned, their actual effectiveness has been called into question. Researchers argue that the most effective strategies to reduce alcohol related injury are <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12855/abstract;jsessionid=4672011288F47CCC0DD2308562874FBA.f04t02">not consistently reflected</a> in the pledges and that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395901000779">labeling is generally ineffective</a> in modifying consumer behaviors.</p>
<p>The effects of labeling on alcohol is an area that is poorly understand in general. For instance, there is considerable uncertainty over whether the labeling of lower strength alcohol products reduces alcohol consumption, with consumers purchasing these drinks over higher strength counterparts, or whether it in fact encourages higher consumption due to ‘self-licensing’. This was investigated in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3956-2">systematic review</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. It found there was low quality evidence suggesting consumers’ perceptions of products could be shifted by low alcohol labeling but there was still considerable uncertainty over what the effects might be.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages</p></blockquote>
<p>The apparent ineffectiveness of warning labels on alcohol products has been explored in another <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4055-8">recent study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. Here the authors theorized that the limited effect of warning labels may be due to consumers paying little attention to them. It has previously been shown that consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages. Increasing attention to warning to warning labels may then be the key to increasing their effectiveness. This has been shown in bar visitors who <a href="http://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsa.1993.54.457">drank less alcohol</a> when their attention was drawn to warning labels.</p>
<p>To find out if warning labels could impact alcohol consumption on a population level, if they were made sufficiently attention grabbing, the authors devised two studies that investigated how much attention is paid to warning labels and how individual differences in drinking behaviors are associated with attention to warning labels.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>The authors recruited students at the University of Liverpool. In the first study, 60 participants were asked to view images of beverage containers on a screen whilst their eye movements were tracked. Students were told to pay close attention as their memories of the containers would be tested.</p>
<p>In the second study the viewing phase was proceeded by either an alcohol intervention talk to manipulate participants (120) drinking motivations or a control intervention giving study advice. The researchers also manipulated attention to alcohol packaging using brightly drawn borders on either the warning label or the branding. The participants then completed a questionnaire to asses motivations to drink in the following week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Results of the study showed that although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels or influence motivations to reduce drinking. Study participants who viewed containers with highlighted health warnings did fixate longer on these however this did not affect drinking intentions.</p>
<p>The researchers propose that a possible reason that participants did not particularly notice the warning labels is because they only occupy 5% of the packaging. This is supported by research on warning labels in tobacco adverts which found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034984?dopt=Abstract">message recall</a> was increased with larger labels. Other reasons could be that current warning labels do not show the consequences of exceeding the recommended intake and features of the labels like the “drink responsibly” message are associated with <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871614009156">promoting the drink</a> and therefore seen as part of the branding.</p>
<p>In order to make alcohol warning labels more effective, the researchers call for further studies exploring the effects of label design and content on consumers’ attention to them. They also suggest that increasing the noticeability of warning labels could be achieved through plain packaging, graphic warnings and front of pack labeling which have all been shown to be effective in food and tobacco research.</p>

<p>There’s increasing recognition that our vulnerability to mental health problems isn’t just about how much we are prone to certain emotions such as anxiety and low mood, but also how we relate to those emotions. If we find them aversive and intolerable, we’re more likely to develop problems. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2071/abstract">new study</a> in <em>Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy</em> applies this principle to people’s experience of guilt and their vulnerability to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), helping make sense of why past research has been inconsistent on whether guilt-proneness is a risk factor for OCD or not. Gabriele Melli and his colleagues provide new evidence that the inconsistent results might be because the key factor is not how much guilt you suffer, but whether you’re highly guilt-sensitive. They found that clients with OCD who said they found guilt unbearable were especially likely to have OCD symptoms related to compulsive checking, such as checking doors are locked and ovens switched off. Though preliminary, the results point to new ways to help clients with this kind of OCD.</p>
<p><span id="more-18447"></span></p>
<p>Melli and his colleagues began by creating a new scale for measuring guilt sensitivity because no such questionnaire existed. The new scale had 20 items, such as “Guilt is one of the most intolerable feelings” and “The idea of feeling guilty because I was careless makes me very anxious”.  Nearly 500 volunteers from a local community in central Italy rated their agreement or not with these items, and they completed other questionnaires tapping their tendency to experience guilt, and their levels of OCD, depression and anxiety symptoms. The results showed that guilt sensitivity is a separate concept from guilt proneness, and that it was more strongly related to checking-related OCD symptoms than depression or general anxiety.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers asked 61 clients diagnosed with OCD and 47 others diagnosed with general anxiety disorders to complete the new guilt-sensitivity questionnaire and other scales measuring their levels of anxiety and depression. The results showed there was a strong correlation between levels of guilt sensitivity and OCD symptoms related to compulsive checking, even after controlling for different levels of general anxiety and depression and obsessive beliefs, such as an irrational sense of responsibility. Moreover, guilt-sensitivity was especially high for OCD clients whose principle symptoms related to ritualistic checking.</p>
<p>“Guilt sensitivity may indeed cause individuals to be vigilant and sensitive to ways in which actions or inactions could potentially cause harm, performing checking compulsions in order to avoid, prevent, or neutralise the feared feeling of guilt,” the researchers said. This could have implications for therapy, they added, suggesting that in CBT, “cognitive restructuring should target not only inflated responsibility beliefs, but also beliefs concerning the intolerability and dangerousness of experiencing guilt.” Note, however, that the new findings were purely correlational so it’s not certain that guilt sensitivity causes OCD checking symptoms or if the symptoms lead to guilt sensitivity. It may be a bit of both. Or it’s even possible some unknown factors contribute to the symptoms and the guilt-sensitivity.</p>

            <img alt="Elephants enjoying the river adjacent to The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage in Sri Lanka, where they spend ~4 hours per day." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Elephants-at-PEO-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Our paper, published in <em>BMC Zoology</em>, is a labor of love, and for me came 30 years after I accidentally stumbled into the world of elephants. I was a postdoctoral fellow in 1987 at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, MD studying testicular function in rat and sheep models when I got a call from the elephant curator at the National Zoo, who asked if I could measure hormones in elephants. He had a young female (a 13 year old named Shanthi) they wanted to breed, but didn’t know if she had reached puberty. Having dreamed of a possible career with wildlife, I jumped at the chance and said ‘YES’ immediately.</p>
<p>Little did I know that there was almost nothing known about the biology of elephants, including puberty, so I started from scratch to find a way to assess ovarian cycle function. Estrogens weren’t very informative, so I focused on progesterone to characterize luteal activity and found a sensitive immunoassay that produced good results. Turns out Shanthi was cycling and she was sent out for breeding. I monitored hormones during her pregnancy and postpartum lactation, and then got interested in the other elephants at the zoo. I published a few papers and before I knew it, I was being inundated by requests from other zoos to monitor hormones in their elephants too.</p>
<p>Little did I know this was going to be the start of a whole new career, and that I would become obsessed with a love for elephants. In 1991, I was hired by the zoo and quickly established the first wildlife endocrine service lab, which focused on elephants initially, but today has produced data on over 250 species (<a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-species-survival/wildlife-endocrinology">https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-species-survival/wildlife-endocrinology</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Little did I know that there was almost nothing known about the biology of elephants</p></blockquote>
<p>As with so many things in life, the more you learn, the more interested you become. This certainly happened to me with elephants. I soon learned how important elephants are in the natural world. They are <u>keystone</u> species because of how they modify habitat, converting forests to grassland, creating water holes in times of drought, and spreading the seeds of plants. They also are <u>umbrella</u> species, as the conservation of elephants preserves not only habitat, but other species therein.</p>
<p>As a zoo biologist, I became acutely aware of how important elephants are as a <u>flagship</u> species, raising awareness for action and funding of broader conservation efforts. Asian elephants are endangered, with only 35,000 – 50,000 remaining in the wild, and populations are being decimated by habitat destruction and poaching. There are almost no wild elephants left in several range countries, like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Nepal and Vietnam (&lt;500 each). For this reason, captive breeding is increasingly viewed as an important means of maintaining insurance populations in case of environmental or anthropromorphic catastrophe.</p>
<p>The problem is that not many captive populations are self-sustaining, here or abroad, and supplementation by wild capture has been widespread, putting further pressures on already fragile wild populations. So, at least in the U.S., I felt I could help by at least making sure we could identify all reproductively viable females (via blood hormone monitoring) for breeding. Teased by the zoo community for a while as being part vampire because of my insistence that all elephants be bled weekly to assess ovarian cyclicity, today it is standard practice.</p>

<p>There are about 16,000 captive elephants in Asia, where they are used in tourism, religious activities and logging. In the mid 2000’s, I began working in Asia, where they face similar problems with elephant population management. I first visited The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage (PEO) in Sri Lanka in 2003, and have returned every few years after that. The PEO has one of the few sustainable populations in Southeast Asia. It began as an orphanage in 1975 with five baby elephants, and today has over 80, including 45 that were born there and span three generations. It is an amazing place, with elephants managed in semi-captive conditions. They do not have individual mahouts (keepers), which is common in most Asian tourist facilities. However, this means they are a bit wild, and certainly not used to being handled or blood sampled.</p>
<blockquote><p>[I was] teased by the zoo community for a while as being part vampire</p></blockquote>
<p>It was in 2007 that I met Dr. Samanthi Mendis, who was the vet at the PEO. It was clear she loved the elephants as if they were family; she knew each one by name, who liked whom, and who were the best mothers and aunties (allomothers). Elephants are a highly social species, and form close social bonds with each other. Samanthi said she was interested in doing a Master’s project and asked if would I be willing to mentor her with a Senior Academic (our co-author, Niromi Jayasekera) at the Perideniya University in Kandy. She wanted to know when the young elephants at PEO started to cycle, and because there were no papers published on the endocrinology of puberty in elephants, I knew this was would be a unique opportunity to amass new information on an understudied species.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8497" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Dr Samanthi Mendis at the PEO" class="wp-image-8497 size-large" height="480" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/SamanthiMendis2-1024x768.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Dr Samanthi Mendis at the PEO</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>She picked out 11 females less than 15 years of age for her study and set about training them to obtain measures of body weight, height and length, and blood samples from the ear veins. In a region where positive reinforcement training was rarely, if ever, used, she recognized the need to treat the elephants humanely and found they readily performed desired behaviors in exchange for favored treats, such as bananas and sugar cane.</p>
<p>When all of the samples were collected, I brought my Mobile Endocrine Laboratory to Sri Lanka to analyze them (it was not possible to export the samples because of USDA concerns over diseases, like foot and mouth). At the same time, Samanthi received training in endocrine techniques as part of our commitment to building capacity in range countries.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that these elephant females initiated ovarian cyclicity earlier than expected, compared to observational data on wild elephants. We just assumed elephants reached puberty around 12 years of age, but this study found many were cycling as young as 4.5 years. We believe this may be related to higher levels of nutrition in captivity compared to diets in the wild, and may be analogous to early puberty associated with increased body fat in modern girls.</p>
<p>Knowing when an elephant reaches puberty is important for preventing unwanted pregnancies in very young females, and can help guide breeding management decisions to maximize overall reproductive success. It has resulted in many zoos starting to collect blood samples from elephants at younger ages (starting at 5 instead of 8 years of age), and making sure young females are not left with bulls unsupervised.</p>
<p>What makes me so proud is that this study has not only resulted in important, new information, but that it fulfilled the dream of a young veterinarian to learn more about the elephants she cared so much about, and contributed to the scientific literature in a way that has changed how elephants are managed today. Our mission at the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation/about-scbi">National Zoo and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute</a> is to save wildlife species from extinction and train future generations of conservationists. This study certainly met that mandate.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="Migration to Europe" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18424" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/thinkstockphotos-488564236.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Some would say that the political events currently convulsing the globe have been driven, at least in part, by widespread prejudice towards immigrants. To begin healing divisions, it would help if we understood more about how such prejudices can be passed from one generation to the next, so that we might intervene to stop this happening. To that end, a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12236/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> has tracked the immigrant attitudes of over 500 Swedish teenagers over a six year period, to see how their attitudes changed over time, and if and how they might be related to the prejudices held by their parents and friends.</p>
<p><span id="more-18285"></span></p>
<p>Marta Miklikowska first surveyed the immigrant attitudes, friendships and empathy levels of the teenagers in 2010 when their average age was 13, and then measured their attitudes toward immigrants again in 2012 and 2014. At the start of the study only, she also surveyed the immigrant attitudes of the teenagers’ parents and peers. The survey included items like, “Immigrants often come here just to take advantage of welfare in Sweden” and participants rated how strongly they agreed or disagreed.</p>
<p>Overall, Miklikowska found that the teenagers’ prejudice towards immigrants increased in early adolescence, and then reduced in mid adolescence. The results suggested that parental prejudice may have a particularly lasting influence: teens with more prejudiced parents were more likely to display increasing negative attitudes toward immigrants through the study. In contrast, having more prejudiced peers was only associated with increasing prejudice in early adolescence, suggesting that the influence of peers diminishes over time. Note thought that this might be because the teen participants’ peer group had changed by the later stages of the study (remember peer prejudice was only surveyed at the beginning).</p>
<p>In the earlier surveys, those teenagers who had prejudiced parents but who also had their own immigrant friends did not show increases in their prejudice over time. This suggests having immigrant friends had a protective effect, but only in early adolescence, again perhaps because these friendships changed later in the study. Intriguingly, whether or not teenagers had immigrant friends at the beginning of the study did not appear to be related to the levels of their parents’ prejudice.</p>
<p>Looking at <em>how</em> parents and peers prejudices might shape teenagers’ own attitudes, the study suggested that empathy might be a key mechanism. Teenagers with more prejudiced parents and/or peers tended to report lower levels of empathic concern for other people in general (though there was no association with their levels of non-emotional perspective taking). Miklikowska suggested that “prejudiced parents and peers might constitute empathy-impeding environments”, which could contribute towards the formation of negative immigrant attitudes in teenagers.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic background and parental education were also relevant. Teenagers from poorer backgrounds and with less educated parents tended to report greater prejudice towards immigrants.</p>
<p>All the above discussion, especially talk of parents and peers <em>shaping</em> teenagers’ own attitudes, comes with a huge caveat. Although the longitudinal aspect of the research is a strength, the methodology was purely observational, so the apparent associations between teenagers’ attitudes and those of their parents and peers might not be causal. Interpreting social research of this kind is also complicated by inevitable genetic influences at play. If a teenager of prejudiced parents displays increasing prejudice of his or her own, it’s possible, perhaps likely, that this is at least in part because they share the same genetic dispositions toward empathy and prejudice as their parents.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, there is a dearth of longitudinal research into the formation of prejudiced attitudes in teenagers, so Miklikowska’s study therefore makes an important contribution. Indeed, she believes her findings could help inform anti-prejudice programmes. “The fact that intergroup friendships [i.e. having friends who are immigrants] are independent of parent prejudice while they buffer against its effects encourages the use of intergroup contact in programmes targeting youth with prejudiced parents,” she said. The tendency for teens with more prejudiced parents and peers to show lower empathy levels also suggests another possible avenue for intervention – perhaps fostering greater empathy skills could buffer teens against the influence of any prejudices swirling around their social circle.</p>

Office workers are at particular risk. In the UK, around half of the workforce is office-based, and spends much of the working day seated at a desk. We<a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-014-1338-1"> previously</a> showed that, on average, London office workers sit for 10.5hr each weekday, with little standing or movement observed during core working hours.</p>
<blockquote><p>On average, London office workers sit for 10.5hr each weekday.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to these concerns, in June 2015 a public health guidance statement was <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/21/1357">published</a> that recommended office workers should aim to stand or do light activity (e.g. walk) for 2-4hrs per workday. The authors – seven UK academics and the director of a national sitting-reduction campaign – suggested this target could be achieved by, for example, using height-adjustable ‘sit-stand’ desks, or taking regular breaks to stand and move around.</p>
<p>As the first guidance to offer specific recommendations for standing and sitting time, the statement was reported by several major media outlets in the UK and further afield. Five UK newspaper websites reported on the statement, and allowed readers to publicly post comments on the story, for example: the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3106596/Office-workers-stand-two-hours-day-Doctors-say-constant-sitting-leading-health-issues-including-obesity-cancer-Type-2-diabetes.html">Daily Mail</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health">Guardian</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3974-0">new paper</a>, published today in <em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Public Health</a></em>, examines public responses to media coverage of the 2015 workplace sitting guidance statement, via an analysis of all available comments posted on newspaper websites. We wanted to explore these comments because public acceptability can be vital to the success of public health interventions; strategies that are unacceptable to the people that they target may be practically or politically feasible.</p>
<p>Each of the 573 comments we analyzed fitted into one of three categories. Those in the first category questioned the credibility of the workplace sitting guidance, querying whether the authors had the knowledge and experience to offer implementable guidance, or challenging the evidence base. Some commentators felt the guidance was impractical in their own workplace, because their managers prioritized productivity over employee health, and would penalize employees for taking breaks from their desk.</p>
<p>The second category questioned the credibility of public health more broadly. Public health stakeholders were commonly mistrusted, and portrayed as a group with clandestine motives that conflict with those of the ‘real’ public. Some commentators, for example, felt public health serves hidden financial interests (such as increasing sales of sit-stand desks).</p>

<p>The third category showed commentators acting as ‘citizen scientists’, sharing their own knowledge and experiences relating to sitting and standing, and how to adhere to the guidance. Some shared advice on how to build inexpensive makeshift standing workstations, or integrate more movement into seated work routines.</p>
<p>The comments we analyzed may not represent the views of the general public; they capture the views of website readers that were sufficiently affected by a media report of the guidance to publicly respond to it. Nonetheless, they provide a glimpse into some of the possible reactions that may face public health stakeholders who attempt to implement sitting-reduction initiatives in the workplace.</p>
<p>Our new paper is part of a program of research that we are undertaking, with UK Medical Research Council funding (MR/N008979/1), to investigate aspects of the workplace context, and how they may shape how people respond to sitting-reduction methods. For example, previous studies (<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3611-y">1</a>,<a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-2635-z">2</a>,<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3023-z">3</a>) suggest office workers find the idea of standing in meetings to be acceptable in principle. We are currently writing up the first study, to our knowledge, to document the experiences of employees who have tried standing in meetings where all other attendees are seated. Findings point to standers’ perceptions of social processes – e.g., power dynamics, violation of social norms, public self-awareness – in shaping their experiences. We are also co-designing, with desk-based office employees, content for a new sitting reduction intervention that speaks to employees’ priorities.</p>
<p>Our new paper, and our upcoming work, reveals the real-world social contexts in which workplace sitting interventions would be implemented, and within which the public acceptability of such interventions is negotiated. We think it is essential that researchers, practitioners, and employers interested in reducing office workers’ sitting time acknowledge these contexts. There has been considerable work to understand which strategies may be most promising for reducing office employees’ sitting time (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2015.1082146">1</a>,<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010912.pub3/abstract">2</a>). Our new work broadens this discussion to consider which strategies may work for whom, how, and in what contexts.</p>

</strong>Myeloid cells produced in the spleen have been defined to have dendritic cell subsets in regards to their phenotype, development and functional roles. A novel dendritic-like cell in the spleen has recently been identified. This <em>BMC Immunology </em>research article uses a new flow cytometric procedure to characterise the activation of T cells by this new subset. Hey et al. show this subset is clearly distinguishable from conventional dendritic cells in its ability to activate cytotoxic effector T cells via  CD8+  T cell induction while remaining unable to activate CD4+ T cells.</p>

</strong>A cluster randomised cross-over trial was implemented to determine the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment strategies with beta-lactam with macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy compared to beta-lactam monotherapy alone. Cost-minimisation analysis is important as it aids the choosing of an optimal treatment from a third payer and social perspective. Crude average costs per patient were calculated for each scenario and it was shown that there were no significant differences in the cost-effectiveness of these antibiotic treatment strategies.</p>

</strong>While studies on wild Asian elephants show that females give birth at 12-18 years of age, there are examples of zoo elephants giving birth at only 5-6 years old. Little work has been carried out to determine the age at which young elephants reach puberty. This study in <em>BMC Zoology</em> measures hormone levels in elephants ranging in age from 3.5 years to 15 years to document initiation of ovarian cyclicity. It was identified that elephants in human care may reach puberty earlier than their wild counterparts, and perhaps this is due to a better nutrition and reaching a suitable bodyweight at a younger age.</p>
<p><strong>Image of the month: </strong><a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0858-y"><strong>Cambrian suspension-feeding lobopodians and the early radiation of panarthropods</strong></a><strong><br />
</strong>Lobopodians are a group of Palaeozoic animals with soft legs, from which the Panarthropoda groups evolved. This group likely illustrates the importance of niche diversification on morphological diversity, however their ecology is poorly characterised. A study in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em> describes a new species found in Canada whose morphology and suspension-feeding ecology is convergent with some modern marine animals. A Bayesian approach to biological classification supports the view that the sort this semi-sessile, suspension-feeding lifestyle of this taxon characterised the origin of Panarthtopoda. A wonderful artistic representation of this <em>Ovatiovermis cribratus </em>has been produced by Danielle Dufault.</p>

</strong>Associative learning results from the pairing of unrelated stimuli while non-associative learning occurs in response to single stimuli. This study by Schausberger and Peneder determines how these learning processes contribute to learning tasks and overall behaviour in the predatory skills of foraging mites. In numerous scenarios where the foraging mites are predisposed to the prey in different associative and non-associate learning environments, it is shown that both learning forms operate in predatory mites and both result in persistant memory, with the argument that non-associative learning is an inevitable component of the associate learning counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>Microbiology: </strong><a href="http://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-016-0916-z"><strong>Evolutionary diversification of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> in an artificial sputum model</strong></a><strong><br />
</strong>Vast diversification of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> occurs in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients during infection. This study in <em>BMC Microbiology</em> looks at identifying selective drivers behind this evolutionary process. Bacterial populations were experimentally evolved with or without a community of bacteriophages. Analysis of the final populations revealed large phenotypic diversity but no difference in relation to the presence or absence of phages. Most commonly, a loss of motility and gain of resistance to the phages was observed. Some evolved populations even demonstrated antibiotic resistance. The concluding populations are similar to those observed amongst clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis infections, indicating a useful model for this infection.</p>

</strong>Appropriate terminology in nutrition education programs and behaviour change campaigns is important in optimising the effectiveness of these efforts. An online survey was carried out by Pettigrew et al. to assess the perceptions of adults to the meaning of four terms  used to describe unhealthy foods. Within the results,  ‘Junk food’ was the term most clearly associated with unhealthiness, while ‘Snack food’ was thought to represent both healthy and unhealthy food. This study shows that a detailed understanding of these meanings is pivotal to ensuring nutrition guidance and health campaigns use appropriate terminology.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <img alt="Open-Science-blog-post-image" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/02/Open-Science-blog-post-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><blockquote><p>“You look at science (or at least talk of it) as some sort of demoralizing invention of man, something apart from real life, and which must be cautiously guarded and kept separate from everyday existence. But science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated.” -Rosalind Franklin</p></blockquote>
<p>In this current political climate, facts matter more than ever. With responsibility as a leading Open Access publisher, a beacon of positive change to archaic systems, PLOS loudly stands up for science and scientists around the world in their efforts to improve the health and well-being of societies and explain the wonder of the world around and beyond us.</p>
<p>Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, enlightenment thinkers advanced politics, philosophy, science and communication; they supported <strong><a href="https://prezi.com/lhqmhzz452rb/enlightenments-influence-on-the-us-constitution/" target="_blank">equality and human dignity</a></strong>, and opposed superstition, intolerance and bigotry. Scientific thinking and the scientific method was a critical shaper of the enlightenment. As we look at the world around us, we must ask, what has the scientific method brought to our world, and to our world view? To answer this question, we must let the data speak for itself. Your data. My data. And the data of every geologist, atmospheric scientist, evolutionary biologist, geneticist, physicist, engineer, software developer and physician scientist. This is a position PLOS has exemplified through its <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank">Open Data policy</a></strong> and we strongly support the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s guidance, provided most recently in its <strong><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2017/01/06/strengthening-global-sharing-scientific-data-and-research-findings" target="_blank">January 6, 2017 memo</a></strong>, on this important area.</p>
<p><strong>Science in Action</strong></p>
<p>But how can this data speak when science communication is blocked from reaching the public and the scientists themselves are prevented from reaching their labs, their communities, their places of work? Access to information, access to research and data enables better policy decisions. In turn, policies informed by <strong><a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge" target="_blank">publicly and privately funded data</a></strong> and created by enlightened governments, academic communities, patient advocacy groups and global coalitions all power improvements in our world. <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change" target="_blank">Climate change</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198" target="_blank">vaccine safety</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/elephant-welfare" target="_blank">animal welfare</a></strong> are among the many areas where we support the scientific endeavor to inform the debate with data-based evidence, and organizations like the <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ferg2015" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a></strong> rely on data-based evidence to foster human health both in the US and around the world.</p>
<p>It is impossible for PLOS to know how many of our global network of nearly 7,000 editors, more than 78,000 reviewers and authors from more than 190 countries are on any particular type of visa. We do know science is, and has been for generations, an international endeavor. Scientists collaborate and travel for post-doctoral fellowships, conferences, review panels, sabbaticals and speaking engagements. Conceptual understanding, testable hypothesis, well-designed studies, observational methods and sufficient replication are the tenets of science discussed during these meetings, as well as during routine days in the lab. These tenets of science are upheld by all researchers, regardless of nationality, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, career stage or professional stature. Immigration restrictions inhibit that free exchange of knowledge.</p>
<p>As a nonprofit publisher, innovator and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science communication, we must advocate for what we know to be true: <strong>PLOS must not only liberate science communication from the constraints of traditional publishing, we must stand up for science to ensure the liberation of scientific facts, intelligent discourse and conclusions based on data.</strong> Given that PLOS’ primary mission is the elimination of barriers to the open dissemination of scientific research, we’re naturally against policies and practices that increase, rather than decrease, obstacles.</p>
<p>In a world that abruptly and forcefully presents challenges of accessibility, accountability and discovery, a rigorous commitment to <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/core-principles" target="_blank">our core principles</a></strong> and mission to transform how research results are communicated is even more critical. A growing international community of readers, educators, policy makers, scientists and entrepreneurs share, reuse and remix Open Access research article content without restriction—advancing the innovation economy and the health of communities around the world.</p>
<p>We continue to support the scientific community from which we were founded and to be vocal in pushing the continued expansion of open science. <strong>We support, and will be represented at, the <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/" target="_blank">March for Science</a> in Washington—now scheduled for Earth Day April 22nd!</strong> We look forward to seeing you there.</p>

 Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as an explosive pandemic associated with severe neuropathology in newborns and adults1. There are no ZIKV-specific treatments or preventatives; thus, development of a safe and effective vaccine is a high priority. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a versatile and highly effective platform to deliver vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins2,3. Here, we demonstrate that a single low-dose intradermal immunization with lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) glycoproteins of a 2013 ZIKV outbreak strain elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice and non-human primates. Immunization with 30 μg of nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNPs protected mice from ZIKV challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months post-vaccination, and a single dose of 50 μg was sufficient to protect non-human primates from a challenge at 5 weeks post-vaccination. These data demonstrate that nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs elicit rapid and durable protective immunity and thus represent a new and promising vaccine candidate for the global fight against ZIKV.

related to my current research: using polygon meshes as a way to represent
neuronal morphologies. I will revisit the previous presentation as a way to
provide the required background, touching briefly on the acquisition of
neuronal morphology data from microscopy and the generation of computer
representations using the SWC format.  The second part of the presentation will
focus on the advantages of 3D meshes and the internal code structure of the

            <p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/01/25/the-curious-case-of-wobblers/">In the last post</a>, we wrote about people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD), who sometimes call themselves <em>wobblers</em>. Quick recap: as a rare side effect of taking antibiotics in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycosides" title="Aminoglycosides">aminoglycoside</a> family, some people suffer ototoxicity, and lose vestibular function bilaterally. The vestibule is an organ that tracks one’s position in space, not unlike a the gyros and accelerometers in smartphones. Having lost their sense of equilibrium, people with BVD have difficulty standing and walking without falling down.</p>
<p>Their equilibrium can be recovered in the short term with sensory substitution. A stimulation device on their tongue feeds information equivalent to the vestibule’s; when they tilt their head to the left, they get a jolt on the left of their tongue; when they tilt forward, they get a jolt on the front of the tongue, and so on. After continuous usage over a period of months, neural plasticity kicks in, increasing the gain of other sensory modalities and recalibrating the residual signal in the damaged inner ear. As a consequence, they partially recover their sense of equilibrium even when not using the device.</p>
<p>Dr. Marissé Masis-Solano and I set about make a more practical version of this system, using off-the-shelf open electronics. This was our first large project with open-source electronics, and we learned a lot about how important it is to iterate quickly to find the design pain points. Here’s how we made our prototype.</p>
<p><span id="more-5916"></span></p>
<h2>The premise</h2>
<p>Our basic idea was to attach a measurement device to a person’s head to measure its tilt; to relay that information via RF to another device on the person’s body; and to actuate haptics using a receiver device so the tilt could be felt through another sense.</p>
<h2>The glove</h2>
<p>We decided to build a glove to house haptics. The haptics information would be relayed via vibration motors. ERM motors — eccentric rotating mass motors — are DC motors with an eccentric mass, which makes them vibrate when applying a DC current; it’s the same kind of device that makes your smartphone vibrate.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6229" style="width: 310px;"><img />ERM motor components, from Precision MicroDrives</figure>
<p>I assembled 4 ERM motors into an array with some solder, shrink-wrap and a bit of hot glue. Marissé then sewed into a glove via a reinforced flap. Fun fact: Marissé is a talented eye surgeon, and as a consequence, she can sew, but she can only sew with curved needles; thankfully, there were a few of those lying around at <a href="https://noisebridge.net/">NoiseBridge</a>.</p>

<h2>The headpiece</h2>
<p>Next, we scoped out the headpiece. We had originally intended to use a simple analog accelerometer to measure the vector of gravity, but in our initial tests it was tricky to reliably calibrate, and didn’t provide the resolution we needed for our experiments.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We decided to upgrade to a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/overview">BNO055 9-DOF</a>, a board which integrates an accelerometer, a gyro, as well as a compass to measure the 9 different vector components of absolute spatial orientation. An IC on the board does Kalman filtering to reliably output absolute orientation, and has its own on-board calibration routines, as well as means of loading previous calibrations.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>At 30$, it’s one of the most expensive components in the whole design. That being said, a comparable device could easily have run into the thousands of dollars only a few years ago — smartphones have made 9-DOFs big business, and prices have fallen steadily.</p>
<p>The cheap accelerometers still have their uses, however; we used one to take some measurements of the impulse response function of the coin ERMs when applying a DC current.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6255" style="width: 310px;"><img />Standalone Nordic RF boards</figure>
<p>We originally experimented with sending the signal from the headpiece of the receiver via standalone Nordic radio boards. However, we found that the combined size of a radio, a 9-dof plus the microcontroller was a little unwieldy. Therefore, we switched over to a microcontroller with integrated RF capabilities.</p>
<p>I bought a couple of Adafruit’s Bluefruit LE Arduino-compatible boards, but quickly found out that they weren’t appropriate for our project, as they don’t support peer-to-peer communication. So I ordered a couple of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/3076">32u4 with RFM69 radios</a>, which have the exact same form factor as the Bluefruit, but instead communicate via an ad-hoc RF protocol.</p>
<p>A big advantage of this line of microcontrollers is that they are directly compatible with LiON battery packs, which can be found in a large range of form factors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6258" style="width: 4000px;"><img />The microcontroller, with soldered 9-dof, and its LiON battery </figure>
<p>A bit of soldering later, we had our prototype headpiece. Originally, we had planned to keep it simple, and put the assembly inside of giant earmuffs, the kind that construction workers use to drill asphalt without suffering hearing loss. However, at that point, the whole assembly was so small that it seemed feasible to attach it directly to an ear.</p>
<p>We 3D printed a couple of different ear hooks we found on thingiverse, but nothing was very satisfactory.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6261" style="width: 200px;"><img />This hook looked cool, but it was unstable</figure>
<p>Then we struck gold at NoiseBridge: in the random discarded electronics bin, we found an old Bluetooth headset! We gutted the old electronics, and our assembly fit perfectly within the shell of the old headset.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6264" style="width: 310px;"><img />The gutted headset</figure>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6266" style="width: 2448px;"><img />The headset assembly worn by a handsome man </figure>
<h2>Initial tests and adjustments</h2>
<p>We started out with a second 32u4 Arduino device as the sole component of the receiver, directly controlling the ERM vibration motors. The headpiece would continuously transmit its position in space, and the receiver would transduce that information to vibration on the palm. You would tilt your head to the right, and the ERM motor in the right part of the glove would vibrate.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Several things became immediately apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calibrating the headpiece was clunky; you needed to plug in the headpiece to a computer via USB and enter a series of commands in the Arduino serial monitor to set the zero point of the accelerometer.</li>
<li>Understanding the status of the receiver — whether it was receiving RF input or not, and whether that input was calibrated or not — was difficult because it didn’t have any way of showing its status beyond flashing a single red LED.</li>
<li>You couldn’t really feel the vibration of the ERM motors within the glove.</li>
</ul>
<p>We went back to the drawing board and made a series of modifications to solve each of these three problems.</p>
<p>First, we worked on the calibration. We originally used 4-point calibration — the user was instructed to tilt their head forward, backward, left, right and then the headpiece would send calibrated information to the receiver. We got that down to two-point calibration: a simpler sequence in which the user was instructed to keep their head at a neutral position, and then move forward.</p>
<p>The was enough to measure the location of the gravity vector in the neutral position, as well as an orthogonal vector corresponding to the forward direction; their cross-product gave the third axis, corresponding to tilt towards the right. Arduinos have very little memory, so I had to come up with a means of measuring the variance of the measurements online to make sure that the calibrations were accurate. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online_algorithm">Welford’s algorithm</a> to measure the variance of the 9-dof measurements online in each of the two calibration positions, rejecting calibrations that were too noisy.</p>
<p>This calibration procedure still required the user to plug the headpiece into the USB, so I made some modifications to allow the calibration sequence to be started from the receiver. I added a capacitive touch board to add a few flexible buttons to the glove, and an RGB LED to tell the user the status of the device: green for calibrated, red for uncalibrated, or blue for mid-calibration.</p>
<p>Because the calibration was now triggered from the receiver, I had to set up bidirectional communication between the receiver and the headpiece. The Arduino IDE is not well-adapted to this kind of multiple device project, so I upgraded to <a href="http://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>. See <a href="https://xcorr.net/2016/12/13/multi-arduino-projects-with-platformio/">my previous post on PlatformIO</a> on how to set up a multi-Arduino project.</p>
<p>To get better haptic feedback from the glove, I decided to use a booster circuit. The 32u4 uses 3.3 volt logic, while the coin ERM motors support up to 5V; I figured that by increasing the voltage, it should be possible to get a stronger vibration, which would be easier to feel. I re-used the same logic transistor logic that I has used previously in the <a href="https://xcorr.net/2016/08/28/flicker-fusion-threshold-circuit-with-arduino/">flicker fusion project</a> to boost the ERM devices up to 4.2V.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6273" style="width: 4032px;"><img />The completed prototype</figure>
<p>The whole thing, with three stacked boards, was a little fragile, and it was easy to accidentally touch the GPIO pins; I placed the whole thing in transparent shrink tube, and after applying heat, got a nice, solid build. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/haptic-duino">Here’s the code to make it all work</a>.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>So how does it work? The headpiece is comfortable and accurately transmits tilt information after a straightforward calibration procedure; RF communication is seamless, and there’s scarcely any sync issues; LED feedback from the receiver is easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, we found that, even after boosting the ERM motor drive, we couldn’t properly perceive the location of the vibration within the glove. Was it that the palm was not sensitive enough to vibration? Did we use the wrong stimulation sequence? We tried, haphazardly, to fix the problem using <a href="http://www.eagleman.com/research/sensory-substitution">different stimulation protocols</a>, adjusting the strength of the stimulation, and so forth, but we got stuck for a while.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we got stuck is that we had a lot of opinions — <em>do you think this works better than the last version?</em> — but not a lot of data — <em>is this quantitatively better than the last version?</em>. The answer was right under our nose — psychophysics! We needed to measure how different stimulation parameters influenced our perception, and optimize them until we got something that worked.</p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll show how we used psychophysics to pinpoint exactly how we could tweak our design to make it work. Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/xcorr-computational-neuroscience-290007894348201/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">Facebook</a> to get notified of next week’s installment.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5916/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5916/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=xcorr.net&amp;blog=3084329&amp;post=5916&amp;subd=xcorr&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <img alt="Great hammerhead shark (Albert kok, Wikimedia commons, CC)" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Great_hammerhead2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>A new study by Dr. Nickolas Marra and colleagues on the transcriptomic analysis of elasmobranches (a subclass of cartilaginous fish such as sharks) and teleosts (a class of bony, ray-finned fishes) has revealed fascinating new information on evolutionary immunology and its impact on cancer development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The researchers focus for this study was on seven particular species of fishes: four species of elasmobranchs (the white shark, shortfin mako, great hammerhead, and yellow stingray) and three species of teleosts (the swordfish, hogfish, and ocean surgeonfish), all of whom were not arbitrarily chosen. While the genomes of these organisms have not yet been extensively studied, they comprise a category of the oldest known vertebrates with a primitive adaptive immune system, efficient wound healing, and the development of regional endothermy in several species. This primitive immune system shares the same B and T cell genes which comprise the basis of our own adaptive immune system, and offers a glimpse into how this system has developed in a challenging environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Yellow_stingray_grand_cayman" class="wp-image-8480 size-medium" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Yellow_stingray_grand_cayman-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Yellow stingray (Tom4Surfing, Wikimedia commons, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The seven species that were studied are also known for having a low propensity for developing cancer (elasmobranchs are suspected to have the lowest incidence of malignant neoplasia of any vertebrate group) and illness associated with infection (based on several case studies), despite being known as the “garbage cans of the sea,” eating carcinogenic material and having flesh wounds exposed to bacteria filled ocean water. In theory this environment should increase their odds for developing tumors, but the opposite has shown to be true. The reason for this low disease rate has never been clearly understood, so Marra and colleagues set out to compare the genomes between these ancient living fish and try to determine a genomic basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Three major differences in the immune systems between elasmobranches, teleosts and higher order vertebrates are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lack of bone marrow in elasmobranches (where B cells normally develop)</li>
<li>The presence of a newly discovered form of immunoglobulin (IgNAR) which lacks light chain structures</li>
<li>Major differences in the genomic organization of immunology genes</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Another adaptive change that is present in ancient fish concerns their cardiovascular system, and the evolutionary development of a system designed to preserve regional endothermy in an icy ocean. This was the underlying reason the researchers chose to use tissue from the heart muscle for comparison; so they could use the heart transcriptome to examine a large repertoire of genes for possible evidence of convergent evolution between each of the fish species.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Great white shark (Elias Levy, Flickr, CC)" class="size-medium wp-image-8481" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Great-white-shark-Elias-Levy-Flickr-CC-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Great white shark (Elias Levy, Flickr, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>On a genomic level, the researchers more specific goals were exploring differences in expressed gene content between elasmobranchs and teleosts, finding differences between specific species in regards to particular phenomena of interest such as adaptive immunity and wound healing, and finally identify genes with a history of molecular adaptation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once heart tissue was collected, sequencing libraries were constructed and compared via paired-end sequencing.  The sequencing was pooled with four species each, and then separated per species to create a species-specific heart transcriptome. The genes were run through BLAST and the results were analyzed and compared though genomic databases to compare and cluster.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Figure 2 From Marra et al, CC The authors. Venn diagram of the MCLBlastLINE sequence clusters shared between teleosts and elasmobranchs (intersection of the diagram) as well as those unique to each of the groups" class="size-medium wp-image-8482" height="226" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Fig-2-shark-genes-blog-300x226.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2 from Marra et al. (The authors, CC)<br />Venn diagram of the MCLBlastLINE sequence clusters shared between teleosts and elasmobranchs (intersection of the diagram) as well as those unique to each of the groups</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Marra and colleagues discovered that while there is significant overlap, there are clear genetic differences between these species, particularly elasmobraches and teleosts. Furthermore, elasmobraches contain exclusive genes involved in immunity, metabolism and gene regulation within the heart genome, which make up a substantial proportion of the genes expressed in that tissue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The researchers also revealed that while each of the species shared approximately 50% of their genomes in heart tissue, 50% were different. It is of particular note the immune genes in particular showed the most difference between classes of fish, both at the genomic and transcription levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the researchers did not find IgNAR using the Swiss-plot databases, they did find IgW (a cartilaginous fish version of the IgD found in mammals), and legumain (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">LGMN</em>), a gene related to antigen presentation in MHC class II molecules which has also been reported to be overexpressed in several cancers. It is suspected that IgNAR was not found due to it not being recognized by the database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Legumain is also used as a target to eliminate tumor associated macrophages, and there are several studies reporting various shark extracts as having anti-tumorigenic properties. Overexpression of legumain occurs in tumor-associated macrophages and is thought to contribute to the tumor promoting inflammation associated with most malignancies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other genes of interest included oncogene <em>Bag1</em>, an athanogene which prevents cell apoptosis; <em>Tim22</em>, which regulates mitochondrial control; and a group of genes which regulate damaging cell peroxidases. It is suspected that <em>Bag1</em> has evolved within the shark genome to be better regulated via highly controlled expression levels so that the cell cycle can be closely monitored, unlike more advanced vertebrates where <em>Bag1</em> overexpression can cause cancer development. In regards to wound healing, there are several pathways which must act in tandem in order for this system to function properly, including inflammation and pathogen clearing. In particular, elasmobrach MHC class II molecules (used for immune cell signaling), have evolved to be more specific and tightly controlled then in higher level vertebrates. This MHC class II specialization is suspected to enhance wound repair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The collection of highly regulatory genes found exclusively in ancient fish species showcases how little scientists know about the earliest vertebrates, and how much information can be translated into human cellular repair. While researchers have made substantial progress on understanding cancer pathways, they have not yet made leeway on methods to reverse cellular damage and initiate repair, making the genome of elasmobranches an invaluable resource in cancer treatment and information.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Since she got back from her year abroad, there’s been something different about Sam. Once an avid rule-follower, now she’s breaking them – and when you raise it she explains that these things, after all, are just a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>Can exposure to other countries breed a flexible relationship to the rules, even moral relativism? According to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/112/1/1/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Cognition</em>, it can.</p>
<p>Columbia University’s Jackson Lu led an international team to explore this question through a range of studies. They knew living abroad has been associated with positive outcomes such as reduced judgment of other groups and, in particular, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/05/06/living-abroad-linked-with-enhanced-creativity/">cognitive flexibility, which supports creativity</a>. But Lu’s team theorised a possible downside: that this flexibility could extend to the domain of morality. Perhaps experiencing many moral codes can prompt us to question our own.</p>
<p><span id="more-18199"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked over 600 participants about their travel habits before providing them with a task where there was a golden opportunity to cheat. Participants took a trivia quiz where a “computer glitch” meant that they had to press the spacebar straight after seeing each question to avoid the answer also flashing on-screen. The researchers were secretly recording the bar presses, and the resultant index of cheating was higher for participants who had reported visiting more countries in their lives. The effect remained after controlling for some of the obvious confounding variables like age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and personality.</p>
<p>Is the effect due to visiting many countries, or just more time away from home? In the next study, 551 MBA students reported both the total time they’d spent abroad, and the number of countries visited, before taking the trivia quiz. It was the number of countries they’d visited – effectively, the number of different moral codes experienced – that correlated with more cheating; amount of time abroad didn’t seem to be relevant. The researchers also took account of the levels of corruption in each of the countries the participants had visited (as measured by Transparency International’s <a href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview">Corruption Perception Index</a>): this showed it was past exposure to a greater variety of other cultures, not exposure to particularly corrupt cultures, that was associated with greater cheating on the quiz.</p>
<p>A further study showed that as well as cheating more, participants who wrote about a multi-country trip subsequently expressed more permissive opinions towards acts of moral rule-breaking like fare-dodging, whether committed by themselves or by others. The implication is that extensive travel doesn’t make you feel that you are above the law, but makes you question whether these laws apply to anyone at all.</p>
<p>All this suggests that the well-travelled participants had picked up a trace of moral relativism from their travels, through exposure to a variety of moral frameworks. International travel seems to enable people to break moral rules as much as mental ones. The effect sizes were fairly small within these studies, meaning that the real-life consequences for well-travelled individuals are unlikely to be drastic.

            <p>Peroxisomes function together with mitochondria in a number of essential biochemical pathways, from bile acid synthesis to fatty acid oxidation. Peroxisomes grow and divide from pre-existing organelles, but can also emerge de novo in the cell. The physiological regulation of de novo peroxisome biogenesis remains unclear, and it is thought that peroxisomes emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum in both mammalian and yeast cells. However, in contrast to the yeast system, a number of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins are imported into mitochondria in mammalian cells in the absence of peroxisomes, including Pex3, Pex12, Pex13, Pex14, Pex26, PMP34 and ALDP. Overall, the mitochondrial localization of peroxisomal membrane proteins in mammalian cells has largely been considered a mis-targeting artefact in which de novo biogenesis occurs exclusively from endoplasmic reticulum-targeted peroxins. Here, in following the generation of new peroxisomes within human patient fibroblasts lacking peroxisomes, we show that the essential import receptors Pex3 and Pex14 target mitochondria, where they are selectively released into vesicular pre-peroxisomal structures. Maturation of pre-peroxisomes containing Pex3 and Pex14 requires fusion with endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles carrying Pex16, thereby providing full import competence. These findings demonstrate the hybrid nature of newly born peroxisomes, expanding their functional links to mitochondria.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21375">doi: 10.1038/nature21375</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/AjmCzPEmPOY" width="1" />

 The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) recognizes xenobiotics as well as natural compounds such as tryptophan metabolites, dietary components and microbiota-derived factors, and it is important for maintenance of homeostasis at mucosal surfaces. AHR activation induces cytochrome P4501 (CYP1) enzymes, which oxygenate AHR ligands, leading to their metabolic clearance and detoxification. Thus, CYP1 enzymes have an important feedback role that curtails the duration of AHR signalling, but it remains unclear whether they also regulate AHR ligand availability in vivo. Here we show that dysregulated expression of Cyp1a1 in mice depletes the reservoir of natural AHR ligands, generating a quasi AHR-deficient state. Constitutive expression of Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells resulted in loss of AHR-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells and T helper 17 cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection. The deleterious effects of excessive AHR ligand degradation on intestinal immune functions could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake of AHR ligands in the diet. Thus, our data indicate that intestinal epithelial cells serve as gatekeepers for the supply of AHR ligands to the host and emphasize the importance of feedback control in modulating AHR pathway activation.

 The origin and expansion of biological diversity is regulated by both developmental trajectories and limits on available ecological niches. As lineages diversify, an early and often rapid phase of species and trait proliferation gives way to evolutionary slow-downs as new species pack into ever more densely occupied regions of ecological niche space. Small clades such as Darwin’s finches demonstrate that natural selection is the driving force of adaptive radiations, but how microevolutionary processes scale up to shape the expansion of phenotypic diversity over much longer evolutionary timescales is unclear. Here we address this problem on a global scale by analysing a crowdsourced dataset of three-dimensional scanned bill morphology from more than 2,000 species. We find that bill diversity expanded early in extant avian evolutionary history, before transitioning to a phase dominated by packing of morphological space. However, this early phenotypic diversification is decoupled from temporal variation in evolutionary rate: rates of bill evolution vary among lineages but are comparatively stable through time. We find that rare, but major, discontinuities in phenotype emerge from rapid increases in rate along single branches, sometimes leading to depauperate clades with unusual bill morphologies. Despite these jumps between groups, the major axes of within-group bill-shape evolution are remarkably consistent across birds. We reveal that macroevolutionary processes underlying global-scale adaptive radiations support Darwinian and Simpsonian ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and accelerated evolution between distinct adaptive peaks.

            <p>Both humans and animals seek primary rewards in the environment, even when such rewards do not correspond to current physiological needs. An example of this is a dissociation between food-seeking behaviour and metabolic needs, a notoriously difficult-to-treat symptom of eating disorders. Feeding relies on distinct cell groups in the hypothalamus, the activity of which also changes in anticipation of feeding onset. The hypothalamus receives strong descending inputs from the lateral septum, which is connected, in turn, with cortical networks, but cognitive regulation of feeding-related behaviours is not yet understood. Cortical cognitive processing involves gamma oscillations, which support memory, attention, cognitive flexibility and sensory responses. These functions contribute crucially to feeding behaviour by unknown neural mechanisms. Here we show that coordinated gamma (30–90 Hz) oscillations in the lateral hypothalamus and upstream brain regions organize food-seeking behaviour in mice. Gamma-rhythmic input to the lateral hypothalamus from somatostatin-positive lateral septum cells evokes food approach without affecting food intake. Inhibitory inputs from the lateral septum enable separate signalling by lateral hypothalamus neurons according to their feeding-related activity, making them fire at distinct phases of the gamma oscillation. Upstream, medial prefrontal cortical projections provide gamma-rhythmic inputs to the lateral septum; these inputs are causally associated with improved performance in a food-rewarded learning task. Overall, our work identifies a top-down pathway that uses gamma synchronization to guide the activity of subcortical networks and to regulate feeding behaviour by dynamic reorganization of functional cell groups in the hypothalamus.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21066">doi: 10.1038/nature21066</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/K1zg_ncRhjU" width="1" />

 Separase is a cysteine protease with a crucial role in the dissolution of cohesion among sister chromatids during chromosome segregation. In human tumours separase is overexpressed, making it a potential target for drug discovery. The protease activity of separase is strictly regulated by the inhibitor securin, which forms a tight complex with separase and may also stabilize this enzyme. Separases are large, 140–250-kilodalton enzymes, with an amino-terminal α-helical region and a carboxy-terminal caspase-like catalytic domain. Although crystal structures of the C-terminal two domains of separase and low-resolution electron microscopy reconstructions of the separase–securin complex have been reported, the atomic structures of full-length separase and especially the complex with securin are unknown. Here we report crystal structures at up to 2.6 Å resolution of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae separase–securin complex. The α-helical region of separase (also known as Esp1) contains four domains (I–IV), and a substrate-binding domain immediately precedes the catalytic domain and has tight associations with it. The separase–securin complex assumes a highly elongated structure. Residues 258–373 of securin (Pds1), named the separase interaction segment, are primarily in an extended conformation and traverse the entire length of separase, interacting with all of its domains. Most importantly, residues 258–269 of securin are located in the separase active site, illuminating the mechanism of inhibition. Biochemical studies confirm the structural observations and indicate that contacts outside the separase active site are crucial for stabilizing the complex, thereby defining an important function for the helical region of separase.

 Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1–4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1–2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.

 CD4+ T cells are central mediators of autoimmune pathology; however, defining their key effector functions in specific autoimmune diseases remains challenging. Pathogenic CD4+ T cells within affected tissues may be identified by expression of markers of recent activation. Here we use mass cytometry to analyse activated T cells in joint tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic immune-mediated arthritis that affects up to 1% of the population. This approach revealed a markedly expanded population of PD-1hiCXCR5−CD4+ T cells in synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, these cells are not exhausted, despite high PD-1 expression. Rather, using multidimensional cytometry, transcriptomics, and functional assays, we define a population of PD-1hiCXCR5− ‘peripheral helper’ T (TPH) cells that express factors enabling B-cell help, including IL-21, CXCL13, ICOS, and MAF. Like PD-1hiCXCR5+ T follicular helper cells, TPH cells induce plasma cell differentiation in vitro through IL-21 secretion and SLAMF5 interaction (refs 3, 4). However, global transcriptomics highlight differences between TPH cells and T follicular helper cells, including altered expression of BCL6 and BLIMP1 and unique expression of chemokine receptors that direct migration to inflamed sites, such as CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5, in TPH cells. TPH cells appear to be uniquely poised to promote B-cell responses and antibody production within pathologically inflamed non-lymphoid tissues.

<p>Many of us get the sense that our elected politicians are out of touch, that they are somehow different from the everyman or woman on the street. <a href="http://The personalities of politicians: A big five survey of American legislators">A new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> offers at least part of an explanation. Richard Hanania at the University of California, Los Angeles, emailed a personality questionnaire to thousands of US state politicians. Two hundred and seventy-eight of them sent their answers back and Hanania compared their average scores with the averages recorded by 2586 members of the US public, matched with the politicians for age, and who’d completed the same questionnaire online.<span id="more-18217"></span></p>
<p>Hanania found that on average the politicians differed from the public on each of the Big Five personality traits: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness, and Agreeableness. He said that this is the first time that the personality of US politicians has been compared to the average personality profile among the public.</p>
<p>Specifically, Hanania found that the politicians scored, on average, higher than the public on trait Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Extraversion, and lower on Openness and Neuroticism. The biggest differences were for Neuroticism and Extraversion, suggesting that people who are less emotionally sensitive, more outgoing and reward-driven are drawn to politics (or shaped to be that way through their political careers).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hanania speculated that the prospect of a life of committee hearings and debates might put off people with more artistic tendencies, hence the lower Openness to Experience among politicians, which is a sign of less creativity and interest in new things. Comparing across political parties, Democrats scored higher than Republicans on Openness and Agreeableness, and Republicans scored higher on Conscientiousness, echoing previous research.</p>
<p>Hanania said his results “show important differences between politicians and the public”. Perhaps these differences in personality could help explain why many of us feel an inherent distrust of politicians, and why we see appeal in candidates who claim not be part of the political establishment. Beware what you wish for.</p>

<p>Internet usage has taken the world by storm in part due to wireless networks, mobile devices, and ease of use. It can affect various aspects of an individual’s personal and professional life. The internet can be a means of accessing valuable resources and it has become a popular source of health information for pregnant women. However, there is little evidence to show the quality of the information accessed.</p>
<p>In this study carried out by Sayakhot and Carolan-Olah, the researchers found that fetal development and nutrition in pregnancy were amongst the topics of greatest interest. It was also found that most women had searched for information on the internet at least once a month. This figure is consistent with national trends of internet use with regards to obtaining health related-inform</p>

<p>ation. They report that significant differences exists between age groups, educational level, work status, number of pregnancies and usage of the internet among pregnant women. A paper included in this systematic review elucidate that those with a higher education were 3 times more likely to seek information from the internet. Married and nulliparous women were more likely to seek advice in comparison to single and multiparous women.</p>
<p>Although information is provided to pregnant women during their clinic visits and appointments, there seems to be a need for information to increase confidence. Evidence indicates that the internet is used as a source of information before prenatal visits or immediately after and that most women felt that the information retrieved online was useful and reliable. However, most failed to discuss their findings with their health providers. This creates a risk of following unreliable sources and inaccurate information about pregnancy. Ultimately it can result in pregnant women being misinformed and perhaps made anxious about certain pregnancy issues which health providers would have otherwise been able to assist with. Health professionals therefore need to be aware of such hazards and provide guidance. Further research is needed to address such matters.</p>

<p>Approximately 830 women die each day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in low resource settings. In order to reduce maternal mortality, encouraging institutional birth is an important factor to allow access to essential medical assistance.</p>
<p>Published in August 2016, Maru and colleagues carried out a mixed-methods cross-sectional study to investigate the determinants of institutional birth among women in rural Nepal. They found that age, income, and ownership of land were key predictors of institutional delivery. Younger women and those on higher income were more likely to give birth in a hospital. Although, most women in the study,</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8469" style="width: 284px;"><img alt="Image by Flickr user mahalie (CC BY 2.0)" class="size-medium wp-image-8469" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Pregnancy-square-Flickr-cc-mahalie-274x300.jpg" width="274" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image by Flickr user mahalie (CC BY 2.0)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>irrespective of where they gave birth, believed that birth at a hospital is safer. The authors also found that long distance or transportation was the most important consideration reported by those who gave birth at home. These findings illustrate that individuals opting for home births instead of an institutional delivery service could be doing so as a result of socioeconomic vulnerability to structural barriers instead of patient preference. Therefore, to ultimately reduce maternal mortality, efforts need to be made to improve safety of institutions by expanding to comprehensive emergency obstetric services as well as tackling the barriers that stand in the way of women opting for institutional deliveries.</p>

<p>Evidence has shown that exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant’s life is the optimal way of feeding newborns. It provides protection against infectious and chronic diseases and has the potential to reduce mortality due to common childhood illnesses which include pneumonia and diarrhoea. In the developing world, it has an estimated potential to avert 13% of deaths in children under the age of 5.</p>
<p>In many societies across the globe, especially in low and middle income countries, the older generation particularly the infant’s grandmother, are considered to possess traditional and cultural knowledge. They can have integrated roles within the household and communities playing a vital part in pregnancy</p>
<p>decision-making and child rearing. Negin and colleagues carried out a systematic review where they found evidence to suggest that grandmothers have the ability to influence exclusive breastfeeding practices. They found that mothers were up to 12% more likely to initiate breastfeeding if the grandmother had a positive opinion, and up to 70% less likely to breastfeed based on a negative opinion. Ultimately, when it comes to exclusive breastfeeding practices, the results illustrates the importance of taking females of older generations, such as grandmothers, into consideration during research, global health practice and health promotion.</p>

<p>In this study, Schredl and colleagues investigated nightmare frequency during the last trimester. They found that a higher frequency of nightmares was experienced by pregnant women in comparison to those who were not pregnant. Nulliparous individuals and younger women reportedly dreamt about their future babies more frequently. Results from the study indicate that the nightmare frequencies are closely related to subjectively experienced stress, anxiety and worries about the health of the unborn child.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/epstillbirths"><strong>Thematic Series Launch: Ending Preventable Stillbirths</strong></a></p>
<p>2016 saw the launch of the much anticipated article collection ‘Ending Preventable Stillbirths’ in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> which took place in October, an important month for pregnancy and infant loss awareness. The collection of articles look at a variety of areas with relation to stillbirth in low, middle and high income countries. Risk factors of stillbirths are investigated aswell as the impact it has on the mother, families, health services and nations whilst also taking into account socially excluded populations. It is clear that more needs to be done to increase awareness regarding stillbirths and breaking the stigma and taboos surrounding the subject.</p>
<p>The articles for this collection can be accessed via its homepage (please click <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/epstillbirths">here</a>).

            A new paper challenges a decades-old theory in neuroscience: Split brain: divided perception but undivided consciousness



According to the famous work of Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga, "split brain" patients seem to experience a split in consciousness: the left and the right side of their brain can independently become aware of, and respond, to stimuli. Split brain patients are those who underwent surgery to sever the corpus callosum, the nerve tract connecting the two hemispheres of

<p>Google the phrase ‘<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=animal+disease+outbreak&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=lqRvWLazLMftauWfspgN#q=animal+disease+outbreak&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=nws"><em>animal disease outbreak</em></a>’ and you will quickly learn that there are many emerging animal diseases being reported on a regular basis from all corners of the globe.  This news should not be taken lightly, as the spread of disease can severely damage the health and welfare of a species, and where zoonotic, diseases are transmitted to humans and can have serious public health consequences.  As humans, we rely heavily on animals for food, transportation, and companionship, so the prevention and control of animal disease is a critical issue.</p>
<p><strong>What is DISCONTOOLS?</strong></p>
<p>DISCONTOOLS is a searchable database built on key information collated in a standard format that then enables an analysis of gaps in diagnostics, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals. This, in turn, informs the prioritization scoring under the six headings of disease knowledge, impact on animal health and welfare, impact on public health, impact on wider society, impact on trade and availability of control tools. Total scores, scores by heading or combinations of headings and comparisons by zoonotic, epizootic and food producing animal complexes are all possible. To facilitate interpretation of the results, a two-page summary is also provided. The user can interrogate the data in multiple combinations and choose to download the data into Excel facilitating bespoke scoring and presentation.</p>
<p><strong>How did the DISCONTOOLS collaboration come about?</strong></p>
<p>The DISCONTOOLS database is the culmination of a very enjoyable journey of discovery that started in 2004. The <a href="http://www.eatip.eu/default.asp?SHORTCUT=659">European Technology Platform for Global Animal Health</a> was set up at that point with funding from the European Commission (6<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme) with the Action Plan calling for, amongst other things, the further development of what was a first attempt at a disease prioritization model.</p>
<p>Following on from this, funding under the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme of the European Commission facilitated the launch of DISCONTOOLS. It was co-author <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/infection-and-global-health/staff/james-scudamore/">Jim Scudamore </a>who came up with the name from DISease CONtrol TOOLS. We only realised the need for an acronym the day before the funding submission deadline and neither I nor co-author Morgane Delavergne could think of a better acronym or alternative name!</p>
<p><strong> <img alt="DISCONTOOLS BOARD" class="size-full wp-image-8443 aligncenter" height="324" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/DISCONTOOLS-BOARD.png" width="472" /></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is DISCONTOOLS important?</strong></p>
<p>DISCONTOOLS was necessary as we need to have a methodology to decide objectively on the research priorities on an on-going basis. In turn, this allows funders to focus funding on the research areas that are likely to deliver the greatest benefits. By having this focus, we speed up the development of new or improved tools and control programs to reduce the negative impact of animal diseases. The importance of this work becomes apparent in the context of the value of animal-based products being estimated at €154 billion per year – small progress delivers very significant economic benefits apart from animal health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>The methodology was developed by the extraordinary collaboration of 342 animal health scientists from across the globe.  I was struck by the generosity of people devoting time to the project, especially since they did not know me personally.  It certainly reflects the importance of the work but also the possibility for researchers to work with and meet colleagues for the first time even though they had been working in similar research areas for many years.</p>
<p><strong>How do we balance applied versus ‘blue sky’ research?</strong></p>
<p>Throughout our journey, it became evident that we can never develop completely novel approaches without fundamental and purely curiosity-driven research. We discovered that 25% to 30% of all research in the animal health area is indeed ‘blue sky’. We need to protect this level of funding.  In addition, funding should be spread over a range of areas as there are many species and many diseases whilst keeping a focus on filling the most important gaps that will have the greatest impact on reducing the negative impact of animal diseases.</p>
<p><strong>How is DISCONTOOLS evolving?</strong></p>
<p>The on-going development of the database should never finish as research and diseases evolve. It is thus great to see that DISCONTOOLS – via co-author and <em>BMC Veterinary Research</em> Section Editor <a href="http://www.avia-gis.com/johannes-charlier">Johannes Charlier</a> – is now contributing to the newly formed Secretariat for the <a href="http://www.star-idaz.net/">STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium on Animal Health</a> and as such shaping future research agendas around the globe.</p>
<p>The methodology is not written in stone. It can and should be further refined with experience. This is why we have developed an interactive database where everybody can contribute their ideas and suggestions to help this development.</p>
<p><strong>What next for DISCONTOOLS?</strong></p>
<p>With new funding in place from national funders of research in the EU and industry providing secretariat support, DISCONTOOLS is currently updating the database to ensure that the prioritization remains current as this is how the database will add value over time. At the time of writing updated disease information is available for 20 diseases. The on-going involvement with STAR-IDAZ gives DISCONTOOLS a global reach in terms of setting research priorities and will lead to a stronger integration of prioritization activities by various working groups at STAR-IDAZ, DISCONTOOLS, <a href="http://www.oie.int/">OIE</a>, <a href="http://www.cabi.org/about-cabi/">CABI</a> and others. Most diseases are global issues where collaboration is a win:win for everybody!</p>

<p>Whether you love them, or can’t stand the sight of them, it cannot be denied that arthropods are the most successful group of animals on the planet, representing a staggering 80% of known species. From the bottom of the sea to the highest permanent habitat, arthropods can be found nearly everywhere that life exists. Forming integral parts of nearly every ecosystem, they cement themselves as the most important group of animals alive on the planet today.</p>
<p>But in order to fully understand arthropod diversity, we must first consider their origins. Fortunately, the large-scale evolutionary relationships between the living arthropod groups (chelicerates, crustaceans, insects, myriapods) are reasonably well agreed upon. If we trace the family tree of arthropods backwards we can see that the insects and crustaceans form the closest branches, then myriapods are next and finally the chelicerates. But as paleontologists, there is always the burning question of ‘but what happened before this?’</p>
<p>Following the tree even further back, beyond what we’d classify as an arthropod, we meet the tardigrades (waterbears/moss piglets), the onychophorans (velvet worms) and, ancestral to all the branches we’ve mentioned so far, are the extinct lobopodians (which mostly resemble spiny worms with legs). This whole expanded group of ‘arthropods and their closest relatives’ is called the Panarthropoda and it is here, with the fossilised lobopodians, that we can discover what the ancestor of most animal species on the planet might have looked like.</p>
<p>This might sound obvious; if the lobopodians are at the base of a tree, then they will surely be the closest approximation to what the ancestor of all members of that group looks like. This is practicably correct, technically incorrect and a massive simplification, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The problems with determining the base of the panarthropod family tree are two-fold:</p>
<p>Firstly, since the lobopodians are all extinct, we cannot obtain their molecular data (e.g. DNA) to construct their family tree, as we do with living species. Similarly, trees that are based on modern molecular data cannot tell us much about fossil species. Therefore, we must turn to the fossil record, and the anatomical information held therein, as the only hard line of evidence.</p>
<p>Secondly, when we examine the oldest lobopodian fossils we can find, they already exhibit high levels of diversity and disparity; there are already lots of them and they’re already different from each other. Amongst all these different kinds of contemporary lobopodians, it’s hard to point at one and say ‘this is the one that best represents the ancestral state’.</p>
<p>Now, a new fossil lobopodian is allowing a revised view of what the panarthropodan ancestor might have looked like. Placed in a phylogenetic analysis (the quantitative method of finding most-likely family trees), Caron &amp; Aria found <em>Ovatiovermis cribratus</em> to be the most primitive member of the panarthropods.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8467" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Lobopodian fossil" class="wp-image-8467 size-large" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Lobopodian-fossil-1-1024x318.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image of the fossil</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><em>Ovatiovermis</em> was found in the world-famous, half-billion-year-old, fossil lagerstätte (site of special preservation) called the Burgess Shale, in British Columbia, Canada. It possesses the typical worm-like body and smooth legs of the lobopodians, but is unique in that it lacks the defensive spines common in many of its kin. Its body is differentiated from anterior to posterior; the anterior is slender, with long legs which host a double-row of bristles, whilst the posterior is much thicker and robust, with short stubby legs, looking much like root ginger.</p>
<p>The lifestyle of <em>Ovatiovermis</em> has been interpreted to be that of a filter feeder, anchored by its robust rear limbs and combing the water column for food using its toothed front limbs. This interpretation is significant, as it shows a specific function for this anatomy at the very base of the tree. Any subsequent species further down the tree that possess these traits can therefore be inferred to have inherited them from an ancestor with a similar ecology. We can therefore say that the panarthropods evolved from a filter-feeding ancestor.</p>
<p>Well <em>Ovatiovermis </em>(<em>Ovatio</em> – Ovation, <em>vermis</em> – worm), you’ve revealed that the ancestor of &gt;80% of animal species was a filter-feeder, stand up and give yourself a round of applause!</p>

            <p><em><img alt="Schoolgirls reading a fairy tale together" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18189" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/thinkstockphotos-140301935.jpg?w=845" />By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/psychology/people/stuart-ritchie-1">Stuart Ritchie</a></p>
<p>It would be very concerning if “girls as young as six years old believe that brilliance is a male trait”, as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/26/girls-believe-brilliance-is-a-male-trait-research-into-gender-stereotypes-shows">The Guardian</a></em> reported last week, especially if “this view has consequences”, as was argued in <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/six-year-old-girls-already-have-gendered-beliefs-about-intelligence/514340/">The Atlantic</a></em>. Both stories implied girls’ beliefs about gender could be part of the explanation for why relatively few women are found working in fields such as maths, physics, and philosophy. These news stories, widely shared on social media, were based on a new psychology paper by Lin Bian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and colleagues, published in <em>Science</em>, entitled “<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/389">Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children’s interests</a>”. The paper reported four studies, which at first appear to have simple, clear-cut conclusions. But a closer look at the data reveals that the results are rather weak, and the researchers’ interpretation goes far beyond what their studies have shown.</p>
<p><span id="more-18181"></span></p>
<p>In one task in the first study, the children were told about a “really, really smart” person, then asked to choose, from a selection of pictures of males and females, who they thought the description was about. At ages 5, 6, and 7, boys tended to pick a male picture, suggesting they linked being male with being smart (at the three ages, 71 per cent, 65 per cent, and 68 per cent of boys showed this “own-gender” bias, respectively). On the other hand, girls linked being female with being smart 69 per cent, 48 per cent, and 54 per cent of the time at ages 5, 6, and 7, respectively.</p>
<p>Results were similar in a second study, except that this time, the percentage of girls displaying own-gender bias never dropped below 52 per cent. So, at all ages except 6 (and then only in one of two studies), girls were more likely than not to assume that a description of a “really, really smart” person was about a female than about a male. Stated this way—and although boys’ own-gender bias was stronger than girls’—the finding certainly appears less worrying than was implied by much of the media coverage.</p>
<p>Although the stronger “own-gender” bias for boys existed in relation to general “smartness”, it wasn’t present when the children were asked a more specific question about which gender gets the better school grades. For that question, the girls in fact had a stronger own-gender bias than the boys. So whatever was causing the girls to believe stereotypes about smartness, it wasn’t making them believe stereotypes about school performance.</p>
<p>But the big statement in the title of the paper comes from the third study, where the researchers found that boys were more likely than girls to be interested in playing a (fictional) game that they were told was aimed at “really, really smart children” (as opposed to a game for “children who try really, really hard”). The researchers contend that the children’s gender stereotypes were the underlying reason for this, arguing that a statistical analysis known as mediation modelling “pinpoint[ed] these stereotyped perceptions… as the underlying mechanism”. But, first, they only tested one mediation model with one possible mediator, so nothing was “pinpointed”. Second, the mediation was only partial: differences in the strength of the girls’ and boys’ average gender-biased stereotypes could only explain a small portion of the differences in their game preferences (moreover, this mediation was only just statistically significant in Study 3, and there was no attempt at a replication in Study 4). Third, and most critically, this wasn’t an experiment: all of the data were purely correlational, and it was therefore impossible for the analysis to have revealed anything about what causes what.</p>
<p>Indeed, unwarranted causal claims abound in the paper, from the title (“…influence children’s interests”) to the abstract (“…have an immediate effect…”) to the concluding paragraph (“…stereotype begins to shape children’s interests…”). None of them can be supported by the data presented. To back up these claims, one would need to arrange an experiment: randomly split children into two groups, intervene to manipulate the stereotypes of one group but not the other, then compare their interests. Nothing even approaching that was done for this paper.</p>
<p>Why would the reviewers and editors at one of the world’s top scientific journals allow through a paper with such glaring correlation-causation errors? One possibility is political bias: these conclusions align with the generally liberal political opinions that many scientists, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691612448792">particularly social psychologists</a>, hold. Perhaps the gatekeepers let their guard down a little because they agreed with the message that the gender disparity in science might have social causes (of course, this is mere speculation on my part). Political bias might also have been the reason that the paper fails to cite any of the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00096.x">many</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/000709905X50906/full">studies</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000457">suggesting</a> that there actually <em>is</em> an over-representation of males in the “really, really smart” end of the intelligence distribution (and also the very low end), even if only to argue against them.</p>
<p>We’d all agree that, if young girls have their career ambitions derailed by their own broad-brush stereotypes about the abilities of their sex, this is tragic, as well as damaging to the academic fields that they avoid. But assessing whether this is actually the case (not to mention doing something about it) requires extremely careful science. As has been noted <a href="https://twitter.com/dingding_peng/status/824922361086504960">elsewhere</a>, if one wants a strong basis for one’s political position, one should be extra-sceptical of studies that appear to support it. Given the widespread sharing, reporting, and discussion of this interesting yet hyped paper, that scepticism doesn’t seem to have been applied here.</p>

These sex differences are easy to observe, with the showy tail feathers of male peacocks and the mane of the lion being some of the most well-known examples.</p>
<p>For years scientists have thought that such differences between sexes are probably a result of sexual selection. This means that the traits that differ between males and females (e.g. elaborate plumage or a mane) are the result of females preferring this trait. But what if they are not? What if differences between males and females are caused by something else? And what if females are also pretty?</p>
<p><strong>Our study subject</strong></p>
<p>Australia is famous for having deadly and bizarre animals, but it also has a very special family of birds, the fairy-wrens. This group of small birds (~ 14 species) from the family Maluridae are famous because they are highly promiscuous and also because they have very bright plumage colourations that reflect ultraviolet light (see above photo).</p>
<p>Male plumage in fairy-wrens possibly evolved as a result of sexual selection (e.g. females preferring bright males). Interestingly, there is also very high variation in plumage across female fairy-wrens. Females from some species are brown and very dull (as in the photo below), while some have blue and bright colourations, just like males. In our recent study we wanted to understand why.</p>

<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>
<p>We went to different museums across Australia and used museum specimens to quantify colour using standard techniques. We measured colour in many individuals and different fairy-wren species, and investigated their geographic distributions. With this information we were able to discover that females of species that lived in open habitats, like grasslands, were more likely to have dull colourations. On the other hand, females from those species that lived in closed habitats, such as forests, tended to have brighter and more colorful plumages, like those of males.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>Our results suggest that evolution of females with cryptic (e.g. dull) plumages is favoured in open habitats, possibly because predation risk is higher in this type of environment and dull plumages camouflage more readily.</p>
<p>These results change our way of thinking about differences in plumage between males and females. They tell us that sex differences in plumage in fairy-wrens are not only driven by sexual preferences. Habitat and natural selection may also drive the evolution of female plumage, resulting in differences between males and females. This means that female birds can also be as pretty as males, depending on where they live.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="Thoughtful and sad little girl" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18165" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/thinkstockphotos-518219250.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>A hugely controversial topic in psychology concerns how likely it is that some or many claims of abuse made by children are actually based on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/26/its-easy-to-implant-false-childhood-memories-right-wrong-says-a-new-review/">false memories</a>, possibly implanted through the suggestions of therapists or leading questions from investigators. A related issue is whether going through the terrible experience of being mistreated makes it more or less likely that a child will be prone to forming false memories based on the suggestions or leading questions of others. In a small but important <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjdp.12177/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Developmental Psychology</em>, a team led by Henry Otgaar at Maastricht University report that while a group of maltreated children were more prone to spontaneous false memories than control participants, they were in fact, to the researchers’ surprise, less prone to false memories based on suggestion. “This is a hitherto unreported finding,” they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-18019"></span></p>
<p>Otgaar and his colleagues tested 127 4- to 12-year-old children, 21 of whom were suspected of having been physically or sexually abused. The children in the mistreated group were recruited through their parents or guardians from a forensic child abuse centre and a child interrogation studio in the Netherlands. All those recruited from the interrogation studio were involved in legal cases related to alleged sexual abuse. The children who formed the control group were recruited from local primary schools in middle class areas. To provide further verification of the children’s status, all parents or guardians completed a trauma questionnaire about their child, and this indicated, as expected, that the maltreated group had experienced significantly more trauma than the control participants.</p>
<p>The researchers tested the children’s susceptibility to false memories in two ways. The first involved the children remembering lists of words on a related theme, and then judging which words among another series had appeared in that earlier list and which were new (this is known as the Deese-Roediger-McDermott false memory paradigm). Wrongly claiming that a related but new word was in the earlier list was interpreted as an instance of a spontaneous false memory. For initial word lists that had a negative theme, children in the mistreated group were more prone to false memories. The researchers suggested this is because, given their experiences, they “might be more prone to automatically activate related but non-presented negative information in memory during encoding”.</p>
<p>To test the children’s susceptibility to false memories arising from suggestion, the researchers asked the children to watch a video of a bank robbery, and then to listen to an eye witness account of what happened. Crucially, the eye witness testimony featured five false claims about items involved in the robbery (this is a version of the “misinformation paradigm” developed by Elizabeth Loftus, a pioneer in this field). When the children were subsequently tested on what items had been involved during the robbery, those in the mistreated group were less prone to making errors based on the false claims in the eye witness testimony – that is they were less vulnerable to false memories arising from suggestion.</p>
<p>This finding about suggestibility is slightly complicated by the fact the mistreated group also failed to correctly identify as many items that really had been involved in the robbery. This might have protected them from suggestion because the falsehoods in the eye witness statement were related to actual items in the robbery. Not remembering the real items would make it harder to form false memories of related items that hadn’t actually featured in the robbery. For comparison, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020811">a previous study</a> using different methods found no difference in suggestibility between abused and control groups.</p>
<p>Given the small sample size of mistreated children and the researchers’ inability to substantiate definitively the claims about what abuse the mistreated children had or hadn’t suffered, these new results should be considered highly tentative. However, the researchers said the findings could definitely be of legal relevance. “Our new angle on this debate is that our results suggest that trauma does affect memory, but in a rather complex and unique way,” they said.</p>

 Deuterostomes include the group we belong to (vertebrates) as well as an array of disparate forms that include echinoderms, hemichordates and more problematic groups such as vetulicolians and vetulocystids. The Cambrian fossil record is well-populated with representative examples, but possible intermediates are controversial and the nature of the original deuterostome remains idealized. Here we report millimetric fossils, Saccorhytus coronarius nov. gen., nov. sp., from an Orsten-like Lagerstätte from the earliest Cambrian period of South China, which stratigraphically are amongst the earliest of deuterostomes. The bag-like body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds, and behind them up to four conical openings on either side of the body as well as possible sensory structures. An anus may have been absent, and correspondingly the lateral openings probably served to expel water and waste material. This new form has similarities to both the vetulicolians and vetulocystids and collectively these findings suggest that a key step in deuterostome evolution was the development of lateral openings that subsequently were co-opted as pharyngeal gills. Depending on its exact phylogenetic position, the meiofaunal habit of Saccorhytus may help to explain the major gap between divergence times seen in the fossil record and estimates based on molecular clocks.

 Land degradation results in declining biodiversity and the disruption of ecosystem functioning worldwide, particularly in the tropics. Vegetation restoration is a common tool used to mitigate these impacts and increasingly aims to restore ecosystem functions rather than species diversity. However, evidence from community experiments on the effect of restoration practices on ecosystem functions is scarce. Pollination is an important ecosystem function and the global decline in pollinators attenuates the resistance of natural areas and agro-environments to disturbances. Thus, the ability of pollination functions to resist or recover from disturbance (that is, the functional resilience) may be critical for ensuring a successful restoration process. Here we report the use of a community field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation restoration, specifically the removal of exotic shrubs, on pollination. We analyse 64 plant–pollinator networks and the reproductive performance of the ten most abundant plant species across four restored and four unrestored, disturbed mountaintop communities. Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity. Interactions in restored networks were more generalized than in unrestored networks, indicating a higher functional redundancy in restored communities. Shifts in interaction patterns had direct and positive effects on pollination, especially on the relative and total fruit production of native plants. Pollinator limitation was prevalent at unrestored sites only, where the proportion of flowers producing fruit increased with pollinator visitation, approaching the higher levels seen in restored plant communities. Our results show that vegetation restoration can improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at least partially reversible. The degree of recovery may depend on the state of degradation before restoration intervention and the proximity to pollinator source populations in the surrounding landscape. We demonstrate that network structure is a suitable indicator for pollination quality, highlighting the usefulness of interaction networks in environmental management.
