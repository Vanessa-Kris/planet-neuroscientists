<p>How environmentally friendly am I really? It’s a question we ask ourselves more and more frequently as the climate emergency remains firmly at the top of the political agenda. So we dutifully eschew single-use purchases, lug our tote bags to the supermarket instead of using plastic bags, and take part in Veganuary, safe in the knowledge we’re doing our bit.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, we may be overestimating how well we’re actually doing at being green. According to new research published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2019.1689364"><em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em></a>, most of us tend to magnify our own environmental efforts, believing we’re doing more than others even when that isn’t the case. The finding is the latest in a number of studies to demonstrate the “better-than-average” effect: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">we also believe</a> we are more intelligent than others, for example, and that we work harder.</p>
<p><span id="more-38965"></span></p>
<p>To examine self-image and environmentalism, author Magnus Bergquist from the University of Gothenburg first asked 2,635 Swedes one question: compared to other Swedes, how often/how much do you engage in pro-environmental behaviours? Participants responded via a 7 point scale, running from 1 (much less than others) to 7 (much more than others).</p>
<p>In a second study, 513 participants located in the UK, India and the United States were asked the same question, rating themselves compared to their own compatriots and their friends. In addition, Indian participants were given an open-ended question about the kinds of pro-environmental behaviour they performed, whilst those in the UK and US were asked how frequently they engaged in 10 predefined behaviours (turning the tap off whilst brushing teeth, for example, or turning lights off when leaving a room).</p>
<p>Both studies suggested that most people perceive themselves to be more pro-environmental than others. In the first study, 51.3% of Swedish participants felt they were more green than others; only 8.6% felt they were below average. The second bore similar results: 75.3% of the total sample felt they were above average (85.7% in India, 72% in the UK, and 63.7% in the US).</p>
<p>Participants also felt that they were better than average when it came to most of the individual behaviours in the survey — but these results might not hold across <em>all</em> pro-environmental behaviours. Most of those listed in survey questions were easy — putting something in the recycling bin, for example, or turning off lights. More difficult pro-environmental behaviour — perhaps making a more fundamental life change like completely overhauling a diet — may not provoke such high self-opinion. Bergquist points to research that suggests people think of themselves as <em>worse</em> than average when tasks appear difficult: one study showed 70% of people felt they could win a trivia contest with easy questions, whilst only 6% felt they could win when things were more tricky.</p>
<p>There was some good news, though. In a final study, Bergquist didn’t find much evidence that believing you are better-than-average prevents you from engaging in pro-environmental behaviours — so the effect may be more psychological than it is practical.</p>
<p>Finding out how we feel about more profound behavioural change could be interesting, as could a more comprehensive study into the impact of under- and overestimation of ability on the way we act — and may also prove to be a good avenue through which to stimulate positive, pro-environmental behaviour.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-6-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>More than a third of women worldwide – within every culture, race, ethnicity, and throughout every socioeconomic class – have <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experienced some form of sexual or physical violence</a> or abuse from partners or ex-partners These incidents, referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), severely affect not only the women themselves but also the children and infants within their families.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0867-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, our team examined the prevalence of IPV among women and its association with rates of mortality among neonates, infants, and children less than five years of age. We focused on the East African countries of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, where there are high rates of both IPV and neonatal, infant, and child mortality.</p>
<h3><strong>The Association of Violence with Maternal and Child Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p>We found that children were more at risk of dying as newborns, infants and children prior to the age of five if their mothers ever experienced IPV. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260513507140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Violence</a> affects the social, mental, and psychological well-being of mothers, undermines their capacity to care for their child, and contributes to underutilization of maternal health services. Given the role that a mother plays in a child’s life, her health status during and after pregnancy is a direct predictor of an infant and child’s health outcomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Protective Factors</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11599 alignright" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/feature-pic-259x300.jpg" width="259" />While IPV was significantly associated with death among neonates, infants, and children, other factors such as antenatal care, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sexual autonomy,</a> giving birth in hospitals, and receiving professional assistance during birth were protective. Consequently, access to adequate maternal health services can help mitigate the association between IPV and infant and child mortality rates.</p>
<h3><strong>Combating IPV</strong></h3>
<p>Our team continues to explore the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518804177?journalCode=jiva" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moderating effects</a> of violence on maternal and child outcomes. WHO has provided guidance on the role of the health system in managing and combating IPV. Health care providers’ responses to those who have been victims of intimate partner violence must be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302966/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multifaceted</a>, with identifying those at risk as only the first step in proper response. As providers screen patients, victims of IPV can explore their options regarding plans for safety and access to support services.</p>
<p>In our study, experiencing IPV was significantly associated with individual and socio-economic factors including area of residence, wealth index, age of mother and her husband, religion, level of education, employment status, and mass media usage. Interventions should thus strive to focus on addressing IPV at a macro level through policy enhancement and not just individual levels. The interconnectedness of the individual and socio-ecological influences warrants an in-depth assessment of this association.</p>

<p>We tend to think of sleep as a positive thing. Not enough of it, and we suffer: our moods drop, and we find it harder to both concentrate on what’s in front of us and remember what’s happened. Being well-rested, on the other hand, is associated with greater ability to communicate, to achievement at home and at work, and to superior <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">recollection of previously learned facts or events</a>.</p>
<p>Based on what we already know about the benefits of sleep on memory it may seem obvious that going to bed would also help eyewitnesses identify those they had seen perpetrate crimes. But in a new study, published in <em><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170501">Royal Society Open Science</a></em>, researchers found no such association: it was confidence, not being well-rested, that made a difference.<span id="more-38960"></span></p>
<p>The team, led by David Morgan from the University of Heidelberg, asked 2,000 participants to watch a 35-second-long video clip of a man stealing a laptop from an empty office; his face was visible throughout the clip. After a distractor task, in which they were asked to unjumble anagrams of US states, half of the participants were asked to wait twelve hours before picking the perpetrator from a line-up.The other half also completed the identification twelve hours later — but only after they had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>Findings from previous literature suggested that this second group might perform better. But, in fact, sleep did <em>not </em>improve memory: participants who had gone to sleep before identifying guilty suspects were just as likely to accurately identify the correct suspect as those who had not. Instead, it was identifications made with “high confidence” that were the most accurate, regardless of whether or not participants had slept.</p>
<p>The two groups were also no more or less reliable at identifying suspects than a control group, which only had a five minute interval between witnessing the crime and taking the test: in each condition, participants’ confidence in their identification predicted their success.</p>
<p>The paper’s authors suggest that care should be taken by police to understand how confident eyewitnesses are when they identify perpetrators.</p>
<p>“Our research suggests police should collect expressions of confidence in the initial identification because these are predictive of accuracy regardless if there was a delay between witnessing the event or not or if sleep took place,” <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/december/eyewitness-identification.html">said</a> senior author Professor Laura Mickes.</p>
<p>“Additionally, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should make use of this information in legal proceedings.”</p>
<p>More research needs to be done here: most literature suggests that sleep <em>does</em> consolidate memory and improve recollection, so working out what prevents it from having a positive effect on eyewitness memory may be worthwhile. Further understanding the role of confidence could also be fruitful — and could even, as the researchers suggest, change the way we deal with crime.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617020034/0/oupblogpsychology/">Does Consciousness Have a Function?</a></h4>

<p>Perhaps, the most fascinating question about consciousness is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">the Hard Problem</a>. It’s the problem of explaining why and how subjective experiences arise from complex electrochemical interactions happening in the brain. It is Hard because the working of the brain should be fully described in term of physical interactions, leaving no room for subjective experiences to fit within our current views of the physical world.</p><p>This theoretical position is so powerful that scientists often cannot escape from the view that consciousness is an epiphenomenon that plays no role, but just appears as a by-product of information processing in the brain. Even if consciousness researchers may not explicitly admit that they take this position, it is a position difficult to argue against.</p><p>The Hard problem is contrasted with Easy Problems, which are about explaining neural mechanisms of objective and observable aspects of consciousness such as the report of conscious perception or voluntary action. Easy Problems are the kind of problems that neuroscientists are usually working on.</p><p>The problem of Easy Problems is that they are not easy at all. To work on<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Hard_problems_and_easy_problems"> Easy Problems</a>, we first need to know what kind of functions are associated with consciousness. Many authors have discussed cognitive functions that may require consciousness. The list includes non-reflexive behaviour, intention, imagination, planning, thought, short-term memory, attention, metacognition, emotion and so on. However, there is nothing decisive about such a list at this moment. In fact, empirical studies have revealed quite a range of cognitive functions can be performed outside of conscious awareness even when the stimuli relevant for the task are not perceived consciously. Even functions thought to be tightly linked with consciousness such as attention, working memory, and executive control can be performed in the absence of conscious awareness. Such empirical findings further corroborated the belief aligned with the theoretical cul-de-sac of the Hard problem.</p><p>Nevertheless, we should still keep searching for biological functions of consciousness. Easy Problems may not be as sexy as the Hard Problem (because the name suggests they are easy), but the importance of solving Easy Problems should not be undermined. Specifically, we need to understand what is enabled or caused by items that enter consciousness as oppose to those that remained unconscious. This fundamental problem about consciousness is termed the Hard Question by Daniel Dennett, and relatively little attention has been devoted to directly answer this question. Without solving the Hard Question, we are not even ready to attack Easy Problems.</p><p>To appreciate the Hard Question, we should distinguish consciousness as a biological phenomenon and conscious experience. When we consider functions of consciousness, they are the functions that are enabled by stimuli that enter consciousness or the functions that can be performed only in awake humans or animals. Functions in this sense should not be confused with the question of what kind of effects conscious experiences (or qualia) exert on physical systems. Because of the conflation of these two different meanings of functions of consciousness, sometimes the validity of asking the Hard Question seems to be questioned. But once this distinction is clear, we are ready to tackle the Hard Question as a target of empirical research.</p><p>In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2019/1/niz016/5648002">our recent article</a> published in Neuroscience of Consciousness, we aimed to offer our tentative answer to the Hard Question by hypothesising possible functions of consciousness. While many cognitive functions are known to occur without consciousness, several lines of empirical evidence in neuroscience and psychology revealed tasks and conditions in which consciousness appears to be necessitated (e.g. trace conditioning). In the paper, we started off by reviewing existing ideas about functions of consciousness and then aimed to propose a unified account for the diverse consciousness demanding tasks in terms of a common underlying function.</p><p>The gist of our hypothesis (called the Information Generation Hypothesis) is as follows: the function of consciousness is to generate possibly counterfactual representations of an event or a situation using generative models of the environment and the self, which are learned through interactions with the environment. The term counterfactual here is used to refer to situations or events that are not happening in front of the agent at the present moment. Such representations allow the agent to interact with the information stored from the past (i.e. short-term memory) or to plan ahead through mental simulation of possible future (i.e. imagination or planning). Importantly, this formulation of functions of consciousness explains in a coherent manner a range of non-reflexive cognitive phenomena such as intention, imagination, planning, short-term memory, attention, curiosity and creativity. Another important implication of this hypothesis is that it is a departure from the traditional view that the brain is a passive information processing machine. Instead, the hypothesis suggests that contents of consciousness are the results of active reconstruction of the reality.</p><p>Finally, our depiction of the role of consciousness opens up a new avenue for understanding the relationship between consciousness and (general) intelligence. A functional advantage implemented by the information generation architecture enables an agent to perform mental simulations for planning future action sequences for novel goals. This function of consciousness endows the agent with the ability to achieve novel goals that are difficult to attain only with a collection of reflexes. This flexible application of knowledge (i.e. generative/forward models) is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour and hint at the origins of consciousness in the course of evolution.</p><p>Feature Image credit: Geralt via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/nerves-network-nervous-system-line-2728138/">Pixabay</a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/does-consciousness-have-a-function/">Does Consciousness Have a Function?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/617020034/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/617020034/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/12/how-address-enigmas-everyday-life/" rel="nofollow">How to address the enigmas of everyday life</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/women-front-lines-military-service-combat-gender/" rel="nofollow">Women on the front lines: Military service, combat and gender</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/12/why-the-holidays-are-the-loneliest-time-for-seniors/" rel="nofollow">Why the holidays are the loneliest time for seniors</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Being able to get away with a few white lies can be a useful skill. Giving your boss a plausible explanation as to why you’re late to work, for example, can be fairly handy — why do they have to know you just pressed snooze a few too many times?</p>
<p>Some of us get better results than others, of course, when we tell fibs. But those who <em>think</em> they’re better at lying than average seem to have a few things in common, according to new research <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225566">published in <em>PLOS One</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-38946"></span></p>
<p>To understand what makes a good liar, Brianna Verigin from Maastricht University and colleagues surveyed 194 participants on their lying habits.</p>
<p>First, participants were asked to rate how good they were at deceiving others on a scale of one to ten. They then estimated how many lies they had told in the last 24 hours, and responded to multiple-choice questions about the kinds of lies they had told (e.g. white lies, exaggerations or fabrications), who they had lied to and how they had lied (e.g. face to face, over the phone or by text message).</p>
<p>In the second part of the study, participants were asked to share the strategies they use when telling lies, and rate how important they felt verbal and non-verbal (i.e. by using body language) strategies were for getting away with fibs. Finally, they were shown a list of strategies, such as providing details someone cannot check or ensuring stories are plausible, and asked to select which they use.</p>
<p>And though previous research has suggested that most people tell one to two lies per day, the results here paint a different picture: that a small number of “prolific liars” are responsible for most of this figure. In fact, 39% of participants reported telling no lies at all, and just six participants were responsible for a whopping 40% of all lies.</p>
<p>The results also showed that those who told more lies felt they were better at deception; high self-reported fibbing ability was also linked to a greater likelihood of telling lies to colleagues and friends, though not to family or authority figures. Those who see themselves as good liars were also more likely than poor liars to do it face to face, and white lies were the most frequent form of deception, followed by exaggerations, hiding information, burying lies and simply making things up.</p>
<p>As for strategy, several techniques were frequently used. “Keeping the statement clear and simple” was popular with 17.6% of participants, with “telling a plausible story” (15.1%) and “being vague about details” (13.2%) coming next. Good liars were more likely to use a range of strategies, whilst poor liars were far more likely to use avoidance.</p>
<p>“Prolific liars rely … a great deal on being good with words, weaving their lies into truths, so it becomes hard for others to distinguish the difference, and they’re also better than most at hiding lies within apparently simple, clear stories which are harder for others to doubt,” <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191220105633.htm">said Verigin</a></p>
<p>And demographics appear to have a big impact, too. Of those who classified themselves as “poor liars”, 70% were female compared to 30% men; conversely, 62.7% of those who believed they were “good liars” were men compared to 27.3% female.</p>
<p>As with any findings based on self-reporting, these results may need to be taken with a pinch of salt. But this initial understanding of how proficient liars weave their web of falsehoods could be an interesting path to pursue, not least in developing strategies to work out when someone is lying.</p>
<p>The fact liars combine lies with the truth is particularly interesting — though we may feel like we can tell when someone is lying because of the <em>content</em> of what they say, this may actually be a bit more difficult. Developing new ways to detect lies, therefore, may be useful (particularly when it comes to criminal investigations).</p>
<p>But until then, don’t worry — your boss probably believes your train really was delayed.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/">Une analyse globale de la nouvelle politique de recherche - (II) Préjugés psychologiques de l’idéologie managériale</a></h4>

<p>J’ai souligné dans la <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">première partie</a> que l’idéologie managériale qui sous-tend les réformes actuelles de la recherche et de l’enseignement supérieur, et plus globalement la théorie du <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_gestion_publique"><em>nouveau management public</em></a>, est un obscurantisme. D’un point de vue scientifique, ce qui est frappant dans l’idéologie managériale, c’est la grossièreté des présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Il ne s’agit que de carotte et de bâton : primes d’un côté, précarisation de l’autre. « Manager », c’est donc concevoir une structure d’incitations appropriées (« incentive structure »). La seule façon de faire travailler quelqu’un est de l’inciter financièrement à le faire, et de le sanctionner lorsqu’il ne le fait pas bien. En résumé, c’est de la psychologie béhavioriste dans sa version la plus grossière.</p>
<p>Il n’est apparemment pas venu à l’idée de ces gens qu’on puisse faire un travail parce qu’on l’aime, sans qu’il y ait pour autant une récompense extrinsèque, ou la menace d’une sanction. Ou qu’on puisse soigner correctement un patient, ou éviter de trafiquer ses données scientifiques, pour des raisons avant tout morales - comme le respect de son prochain et l’éthique intellectuelle. Ce n’est peut-être pas un hasard si ces idées sont théorisées principalement par des économistes, dont un certain nombre (heureusement, pas tous) semblent croire à la fable ridicule de l’« <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-criticism-of-homo-economicus-or-people-are-neither-rational-nor-irrational/">homo economicus</a> ».</p>
<p>Or il se trouve (quelle surprise) que l’avidité et la peur ne sont pas les seules passions humaines. Il y a une littérature considérable en psychologie, par exemple, sur la motivation intrinsèque, comme la curiosité. Voir par exemple la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychologie)">théorie du flow</a> de Mihály Csíkszentmihályi - mais pourquoi donc des gens font-ils du surf sans être payés ?! Et oui, les comportements moraux et altruistes existent, chez l’humain comme chez bien d’autres espèces (voir par exemple le travail de l’éthologue <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal">Frans de Waal</a>). Il y a également une dimension morale dans une grande partie des activités sociales, et de manière évidente dans les métiers scientifiques et de santé : il s’agit de rechercher la vérité, ou de soigner des personnes (il ne peut pas y avoir de débat scientifique sans un minimum de confiance attribuée à ses acteurs). Ce que résume l’expression « conscience professionnelle ».</p>
<p>La motivation humaine est complexe, et si elle ne se réduit pas à l’altruisme, elle ne se réduit pas non plus à l’avidité et la peur. On se demande bien d’ailleurs quel degré d’inculture il faut avoir en face de nous pour que ce rappel soit nécessaire, tant une bonne partie de la littérature tourne autour de ce fait.</p>
<p>Le rôle des structures, par conséquent, est de permettre à certains aspects de la motivation humaine de s’exprimer, plutôt que d’autres. Ceci est très bien illustré par le <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vzxdYm8NzY">discours poignant d’une diabétologue</a> dans le contexte des politiques managériales de l’hôpital. Elle y explique l’effet d’une gestion bureaucratique fondée exclusivement sur la carotte et le bâton : « je devenais une espèce de robot », « je ne suis plus éthique ». Cette nouvelle organisation fondée exclusivement sur la récompense et la sanction (extrinsèques) la conduit à ne plus exercer correctement son métier. Or, le point crucial à relever, c’est qu’auparavant, les médecins n’avaient absolument pas besoin de cela pour soigner les patients. Ils soignaient parce que c’était leur métier. Pas parce que ça rapporte à l’hôpital et que du coup ils auront peut-être une prime. Il existe (existait) des structures sociales pour encourager cette attitude vertueuse. Par exemple la formation (comme l’internat) dans des structures où cette attitude est socialement valorisée. Peut-être aussi la sélection : pour être médecin hospitalier, il faut avoir fait ses preuves dans un service hospitalier, et donc être choisi par d’autres médecins hospitaliers selon des critères propres à l’éthique du métier, et non selon le taux de remplissage des lits.</p>
<p>Quelle drôle d’idée, lorsque l’on a un système qui fonctionne en permettant aux motivations humaines les plus vertueuses de s’exprimer, de le changer pour un système manifestement dysfonctionnel, précisément parce qu’il est organisé pour encourager le pire de l’humain - l’avidité et la peur. Cette drôle d’idée, on ne peut l’avoir que si l’on possède une vision caricaturale de la psychologie humaine. Une vision sectaire et, puisqu’en l’occurrence il s’agit de choses très documentées scientifiquement, une vision obscurantiste. Dans ce contexte, l’insistance des partisans du nouveau management public à instaurer une révolution culturelle (la fameuse « culture du résultat ») est particulièrement inquiétante. Il s’agit ni plus ni moins que d’expurger pratiquement tout ce qu’il y a d’humain en chacun de nous, et de nous transformer, en effet, en « une espèce de robot ».</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Watching climate activist Greta Thunberg’s passionate speech to world leaders at the UN in New York last September, it was impossible not to be struck by her depth of feeling. For me, it was deeply moving. For a guest speaking on <em>Fox News</em>, this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzaQz5yYJHs">“climate hysteria” from a “mentally ill Swedish child”</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hardly news to point out that Thunberg is polarising. For everyone who feels shocked and shamed into doing whatever they can — no matter how small — to mitigate climate change, there seems to be someone else who finds her outrage unbearable. But would Thunberg really be more broadly appealing if she did things any differently? Are there, in other words, any lessons from psychological research that she and other activists might bear in mind?</p>
<p><span id="more-38939"></span></p>
<p>For any activist hoping to change the world, their audience must first accept that change is necessary, and also feel motivated and empowered to achieve that change. Psychology is of course key to all this, and <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/september-2018/yawning-apocalypse">numerous studies are being done in this area</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to that first point — accepting the need for change — Nadia Bashir at the University of Toronto and colleagues wondered whether people might resist it in some cases not because (or not just because) they have problems with the message, but rather because they’re not keen on the messenger.</p>
<p>In an online study involving 140 US participants, published in 2013, the researchers found that environmentalist activists were perceived as being unappealingly eccentric and militant. Not only did the participants perceive them as having unappealing traits, but <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/02/activists-have-an-image-problem-say-social-psychologists/">they didn’t want to affiliate with such people, either</a>. Their “seemingly zealous dedication to a social cause may backfire and elicit unfavourable reactions from others,” Bashir and her colleagues wrote. “The very individuals who are most actively engaged in promoting social change may inadvertently alienate members of the public and reduce pro-change motivation.”</p>
<p>Given these results, you might suspect that this particular participant group had more “anti-environment” than “pro-environment” members. However, as research out of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication has made plain, <a href="http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/Global%20Warming/12-2015%20Segmentation%20Report_D10_DTP%20Formatted_v2b-1b.pdf">the division within the general public is simply not that binary [PDF]</a>. The researchers identified nine distinct “environmental attitude” groups in the US, each with their own constellation of views on everything from whether an environmental crisis exists to what the government’s role should be in regulating it. Parts of Thunberg’s UN speech may, then, have struck the receptive minds of some across the pro- and ‘anti’-environment lines, while causing others to batten down their psychological hatches. Of course, you can’t please all of the people all of the time. If it were possible to direct nuanced climate change-related messages to these distinct groups, potentially, this might lead to more desired change overall.</p>
<p>What about emotion? Should activists display it, or not? The great Roman orator and statesman Cicero <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/192160?seq=1">advised speakers to prefer emotion to reason</a>. And <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/seminarinemotion/2018/03/05/targeting-specific-audiences-using-emotional-appeals/">emotion-based marketing</a> is known to be more effective than fact-based approaches. Some people do find all-out outrage off-putting. But perhaps our society needs to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/09/psychologists-claim-outrage-is-getting-a-bad-rap/">encourage a more positive view of it</a>, argue a trio of psychologists from Penn State and Harvard. In one experiment, published in 2018, they reported that feelings of outrage were more effective at driving participation in a project to address an injustice than feelings of hope that such a project might work. Moral outrage is a “critical force for collective action,” they concluded.</p>
<p>Teenagers are renowned for doing outrage pretty well. They’re also well-connected via social media, and also have other activist advantages, argued Albert Bandura at Stanford University and Lynne Cherry of the organisation Young Voices for the Planet, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2019-49287-001">in a 2019 paper</a> in <em>American Psychologist</em>. “Climate scientists have been sounding increasingly urgent alarms about the catastrophic consequences of climate change,” the pair wrote. And yet, “twenty annual UN Summits provided no international commitment to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases”. So it’s important to look at who might be best placed to really make a difference — and they believe the answer lies in young activists.</p>
<p>Young people are in a better position to catalyse action on climate change than most adults, think Bandura and Cherry. Young people are effective messengers, they write, because without change, they will suffer far more than the adults around today. And they can occupy the moral high ground, because the audience knows that they are not beholden to special interests (like making money or winning elections).</p>
<p>Thunberg has achieved truly global fame, but Bandura and Cherry point to other examples of hugely influential young activists, such as German environmentalist Felix Finkbeiner, who, after learning as a boy that trees absorb carbon dioxide, <a href="https://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/home">set up a project</a> that has led to more than a million trees being planted worldwide. Think back to the second part of what’s needed for change (feeling motivated and empowered to achieve that change) — Finkbeiner presented a problem, and also a practical way for people to help, even in the smallest way, to address it. There are many other examples of child <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/28/generation-greta-young-climate-activists-around-world">environmental activists</a> bringing about meaningful change, they note.</p>
<p>There is evidence that even in the US, record numbers of people are worried about climate change. According to the results of <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/">a nationally representative survey, published in 2019</a>, 73 per cent think it’s happening, 69 per cent are worried about it and 29 per cent are very worried. “After a year of devastating extreme events, dire scientific reports, and growing media coverage of climate change, a record number of Americans are convinced that human-caused global warming is happening, are increasingly worried, and say the issue is personally important to them,” said lead researcher Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale University.</p>
<p>Climate activists like Thunberg may, then, increasingly be preaching to the converted, and be less likely to be viewed as “unappealingly eccentric and militant” than might have been the case only five years ago.</p>
<p>But when it comes to persuading other people to make necessary changes, it’s worth bearing in mind the potential power of humour, as well as fear, argues Jeff Niederdeppe at Cornell University’s Center for a Sustainable Future.</p>
<p>In 2018, he and a PhD student, Christofer Skurka, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/68/1/169/4858531?redirectedFrom=fulltext">worked with a theatre group to create a series of videos</a> featuring a weathercaster making forecasts about extreme weather patterns caused by climate change. One, the “ominous” version, highlighted the severity of climate change and its impacts. In another “humorously” silly version, the weathercaster seemed clueless as he struggled to understand the signs of climate change. A third was designed to be neutral in tone.</p>
<p>The “ominous” video, designed to inspire fear, was effective across the full age range of 18 to 30 years. But the humorous one worked well for the 18- to 24-year-olds, too. “The people who found it funny were more likely to want to plan or partake in activism, recycle more and believe climate change is risky,” Skurka reported.</p>
<p>Some people may mock Thunberg. Others may applaud her, though make no changes in their lives. Yet others will take her message to heart. It’s purely anecdotal evidence, of course, but the week after that particular UN address, someone on the Google mailing group for my own street, and a group of streets around mine, put out a message saying that they were concerned about climate change, and asking anyone who felt the same way to get in touch, to meet, to discuss what we as a small community can do. I’ve lost count of how many people have reacted to the thread. It’s true that I would have predicted that my particular neighbourhood would respond in that way. Around here, she was preaching to the converted — but those who needed an extra nudge.</p>
<p>Still, as so many studies, from those run by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication to the extreme weather videos experiments have shown, we’re different, and surely no one type of activism or activist will appeal to everyone. All kinds of voices will be needed to truly make a difference in 2020, and beyond.</p>

<img alt="Transplant nephrologist looking into microscope" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Doctor_microscope-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With the rising rates of obesity, type II diabetes and an aging population, the number of individuals developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing globally.  With more individuals seeking kidney transplantation, the gap between those waiting for a transplant, and available kidney allografts, is unfortunately widening. Efforts with more potent immunosuppressive agents, protocols with desensitization, educational efforts, altruistic donors, and swap programs have made live donor transplants more accessible.</p>
<p>However, the expansion of live donor programs alone cannot accommodate all those on transplant waiting lists so nephrology care providers are looking more closely at the practices of using deceased donor allografts. Many of these allografts are discarded following biopsy, due to disease or damage during organ procurement. Discard rates of up to 20% have been reported in the US.  The difference in discard rates in other countries such as the 9% rate in France raise the question about possible differences in criteria for discards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are we discarding too many kidneys?</p></blockquote>
<p>This week in <em><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo6_auqr05gIVCbLtCh1isAidEAAYASAAEgImAvD_BwE">BMC Nephrology</a></em>, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1664-8">Lee <em>et al.</em> reported</a> on a South Korean hospital’s experience of utilizing allografts from deceased donors over the age of 70, with creatinine levels of &gt;3.0mg/dl or GFR of less than 30mL/min. In these cases, both kidneys were transplanted into recipients that tended to be older and more likely to have co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes.  Though a small study of 15 cases of dual kidney transplants, versus 124 recipients of standard criteria donor (SCD) and 80 recipients of the expanded criteria donor (ECD), the positive results at least warrant the examination of current practices which can lead to discarding allografts. The groups had similar patient survival rates, nadir creatinine and time to nadir creatinine. This single center’s experience prompts the question – are we discarding too many kidneys that could provide older recipients with comorbidities possibly improving their survival compared to remaining on dialysis and a better quality of life?</p>

<p>Recognition of the number of hepatitis C positive allografts that were being discarded due to the lack of Hepatitis C positive recipients led to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7326%2FM17-2871">work on</a> protocols allowing for transplantation into hepatitis C negative recipients while using new antiviral therapies. Beyond the development of new protocols, we need to look at current policies and regulations that may impact on the decisions by transplant centers to use certain organ offers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11595" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Doctor, stethoscope" class="size-medium wp-image-11595" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Doctor_Resized-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In the US, regulations by <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare Services (CMS)</a> help to protect patients by reporting patient and graft survival rates and how this could influence transplant centers to be less conservative about using those allografts from donors that are older and have more comorbidities. In a 2016 analysis of low-performance score transplant centers, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.13594">Schold <em>et al.</em></a> noted in subsequent years the outcomes would improve but this was accompanied by greater rate of patient removal from waiting lists (28.6 more removals /1000 year follow up, <em>p </em>&lt; 0.001) and from a drop in transplant rates (-11.9/1000 years follow up, <em>p </em>&lt; 0.001). While it is important to look at all allograft offers with a goal of a successful transplant, are we too quick or too conservative in our use of less than perfect kidneys?</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">Une analyse globale de la nouvelle politique de recherche (I) - le contexte idéologique</a></h4>

<p>La communauté scientifique est en effervescence à l’approche de la mise en place de la « <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/pid39124/loi-de-programmation-pluriannuelle-de-la-recherche.html">loi de programmation pluriannuelle de la recherche </a>» (LPPR). Au programme, entre autres : un renforcement de la mise en compétition des structures et des personnes par l’intermédiaire d’appels à projets, un renforcement de la précarisation (déjà très importante) par l’implémentation de la « tenure track », c’est-à-dire CDD de 5-7 ans pouvant (ou pas) mener à une titularisation, un accroissement de l’évaluation bureaucratique (c’est-à-dire par des objectifs chiffrés) des institutions et des personnes, une différenciation des rémunérations et des conditions de travail notamment par une politique de primes généralisée, un temps d’enseignement des enseignants-chercheurs non plus statutaire (192h équivalent-TD) mais « négocié » avec la direction, un renforcement de la recherche « partenariale » (c’est-à-dire au profit d’une entreprise) au détriment de la recherche fondamentale, et, globalement, un affaiblissement considérable de l’autonomie scientifique et universitaire.</p>
<p>Naturellement, ce projet suscite une inquiétude considérable dans la communauté académique, et de nombreuses critiques ont déjà été formulées, par le biais des institutions (qui ignorent ces critiques) mais également dans la presse. En passant : je parlerai par la suite de projet, de politique ou d’idéologie plutôt que de loi, car il est vraisemblable que l’essentiel du projet se passe du débat parlementaire. Les « tenure-tracks » par exemple, qui signent la mort annoncée des statuts de chargé de recherche et maître de conférences, <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/1217761189721268224?s=20">ont déjà été mis en place cette année</a> avant même la discussion de la loi, grâce à une disposition législative elle-même non discutée au Parlement, le CDI de projet (passée par ordonnances en 2017).</p>
<p>Beaucoup de choses ont été dites et écrites, mais les discussions tournent généralement autour de points spécifiques, sur chacune des mesures prises individuellement, et donc de manière réductionniste. Par exemple, concernant l’ANR qui finance désormais les projets de recherche, une partie de la communauté se focalise sur le faible taux de succès (10-15% selon les années), source en effet d’un énorme gâchis. Des voix s’élèvent donc pour augmenter le budget de l’ANR de façon à augmenter ce taux de succès. Or l’ANR finance en grande partie des postdocs, et augmenter son budget va donc mécaniquement entraîner une précarisation, précarisation qui suscite pourtant l’inquiétude de cette même communauté. Concernant la tenure track, si la communauté y est généralement opposée, certains y voient une évolution potentiellement positive « si c’est bien fait », en permettant par exemple des rémunérations plus attractives, comme le pouvoir l’annonce. C’est oublier que ce qui permet une augmentation des rémunérations, c’est soit une augmentation du budget (qui pourrait se faire sans précarisation) soit une diminution du nombre de recrutements. D’autres se disent que la tenure track (CDD puis titularisation conditionnelle) est un progrès par rapport au postdoc (CDD puis concours). C’est négliger deux choses : d’une, que la tenure track n’exclut pas le postdoc, qui reste la norme dans tous les pays qui implémentent la tenure track ; d’autre part, que les chances de titularisation dépendent non des mots employés par les autorités pour faire la publicité de la réforme (« engagement moral »), mais du budget rapporté au nombre de candidats. Etant donné que le concours CNRS, pour prendre un exemple, a un taux de succès de 4%, de deux choses l’une : soit la tenure track va avoir un taux de sélection comparable, auquel cas la différence principale avec le système actuel sera la précarité du contrat ; soit le taux de titularisation sera comparable, auquel cas l’effet principal sera de reculer de 5-7 ans l’âge de la sélection pour un poste stable ; ou bien sûr, le plus probable, un intermédiaire : taux de sélection de 8%, taux de titularisation de 50%.</p>
<p>Enfin concernant les « CDIs de projet », c’est-à-dire une mesure essentiellement technique permettant de mettre en place des CDDs plus longs que ceux autorisés par la loi, nombreux sont ceux, en particulier en biologie, qui voient cette mesure d’un bon œil. La raison est la loi Sauvadet censée résorber la précarité, qui impose à l’employeur de titulariser les personnels en CDD depuis plusieurs années. Mais comme l’Etat ne veut pas titulariser, cela signifie que les institutions refusent de prolonger les CDDs au-delà d’une certaine limite. Cela est perçu à juste titre comme un gâchis par de nombreux chercheurs, car il se produit souvent une situation dans laquelle un laboratoire dispose des fonds pour prolonger le contrat d’un postdoc expérimenté, mais est contrainte administrativement de recruter à la place un postdoc inexpérimenté. Cependant, de manière plus globale, l’effet de la mise en place de CDIs de projet est mécaniquement un allongement de la durée des postdocs, donc une titularisation (ou non) plus tardive, assortie éventuellement d’une diminution du nombre de postdocs - à moins que le taux de succès de l’ANR augmente par une augmentation de budget.</p>
<p>En résumé, une analyse réductionniste ne permet pas de former une critique cohérente. Elle tend à naturaliser le fonctionnement des institutions, c’est-à-dire à considérer par exemple que le financement par projet de la recherche est une sorte de loi de la nature plutôt qu’une construction sociale (d’où la référence constante aux « standards internationaux »). Or il s’agit bien entendu de politiques choisies, et dans le cas de la France assez récemment. C’est pourquoi il me semble important de prendre un peu de recul pour analyser cette nouvelle politique de manière globale, y compris dans le contexte plus large des politiques publiques.</p>

<li><em> L’idéologie générale : le nouveau management public</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Antoine Petit, PDG du CNRS, a brillamment résumé l’inspiration idéologique de la LPPR: il s’agira d’une loi « <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/sciences-prospective/la-recherche-une-arme-pour-les-combats-du-futur-1150759">darwinienne </a>». Cette terminologie n’a pas manqué de susciter de vives critiques de la part de la communauté scientifique (<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2019/12/06/le-darwinisme-social-applique-a-la-recherche-est-une-absurdite_6021868_3232.html">ici</a> et <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2019/12/23/francois-xavier-fauvelle-monsieur-le-pdg-du-cnrs-savez-vous-ce-que-votre-darwinisme-fait-a-la-recherche_6023835_3232.html">là</a>). Il s’agit de mettre en compétition des institutions et des personnes sur la base d’objectifs décidés par l’Etat, et « que le meilleur gagne ». Cette référence n’est absolument pas anecdotique, contrairement à ce que Mme Vidal et M. Petit ont essayé d’expliquer de manière peu convaincante par la suite. Il s’agit d’une forme de gestion publique qui n’est ni improvisée ni spécifique à la recherche, et qui a été théorisée sous le nom de <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_gestion_publique"><em>nouveau management public</em></a>. Il s’agit non plus d’organiser les services publics par la mise en place raisonnée d’infrastructures publiques, de manière spécifique à chaque mission (une approche perçue comme « soviétique » et donc inefficace), mais en mettant en compétition diverses institutions, qui sont « libres » de mettre en place les moyens qu’ils jugent nécessaires pour accomplir des objectifs chiffrés fixés par l’Etat. Ces objectifs peuvent être par exemple la position dans un classement international des universités, ou la durée moyenne de séjour dans les hôpitaux. C’est le sens du mot « autonomie » dans l’« <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_relative_aux_libert%C3%A9s_et_responsabilit%C3%A9s_des_universit%C3%A9s">autonomie des universités </a>» instaurée par Nicolas Sarkozy en 2007. Naturellement, il ne s’agit pas d’autonomie scientifique, puisque celle-ci suppose précisément un financement inconditionnel (c’est-à-dire emploi garanti et budget récurrent), ni d’autonomie financière puisque les financements restent versés par l’Etat, sous condition d’objectifs fixés par l’Etat. Il s’agit d’une autonomie de méthode, pour accomplir des objectifs fixés préalablement par l’Etat.</p>
<p>Naturellement, cette mise en compétition au niveau des structures (e.g. universités) se décline de manière hiérarchique jusqu’à l’échelle individuelle, puisque pour survivre, la structure doit faire en sorte que les employés contribuent à la réalisation des objectifs. C’est pourquoi il est en permanence question d’instaurer une « culture du résultat » ou de l’évaluation. Cet appel à la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9volution_culturelle">révolution culturelle</a> qui évoque le maoïsme est d’ailleurs tout à fait significatif, j’y reviendrai.</p>
<p>Cette idéologie n’est ni spécifique à la recherche, ni naturellement à la France. Son instigatrice la plus connue est Mme Thatcher, qui l’a mise en place au Royaume-Uni dans les années 80. Elle a également été mise en place par le régime nazi dans les années 1930, <a href="https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/la-grande-table-idees/du-crime-nazi-au-management-moderne-une-histoire-commune">comme l’a montré l’historien Johann Chapoutot</a> - j’y reviendrai. Son bilan, pour dire un euphémisme, n’est pas fameux (voir par exemple un <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00101-9">compte rendu très récent dans Nature</a> d’une étude dans le monde académique). Pour ce qui est de la santé, par exemple, sa mise en place en France par le biais de la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarification_%C3%A0_l%27activit%C3%A9">tarification à l’activité</a> (T2A) a conduit aujourd’hui à une <a href="https://www.marianne.net/societe/crise-des-urgences-l-appel-des-parents-pour-sauver-la-reanimation-pediatrique">situation dramatique</a> - j’y reviendrai également.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em> Une politique libérale ?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il est important de bien situer cette idéologie sur l’échiquier politique. En effet, elle est souvent perçue (et présentée) comme une idéologie d’inspiration libérale. Il est d’ailleurs tout à fait plausible que ses défenseurs la pensent ainsi de manière sincère - bien sûr dans les démocraties libérales modernes, et peut-être pas au sein du IIIe Reich qui l’implémentait également. C’est un malentendu qui est source d’une grande confusion, et qui explique son soutien électoral de la part de citoyens de sensibilité centriste - que sont une bonne partie des chercheurs.</p>
<p>La filiation avec la pensée libérale se fait, on l’a compris, par l’idée de l’efficience du marché. Le marché serait un outil productif efficace en cela qu’il permettrait, par la libre opération des producteurs et la sélection par les consommateurs, de faire émerger les solutions les plus efficaces. D’où l’essence « darwinienne » de ces idées (dans le sens bien sûr des croyances populaires, et non du Darwinisme en biologie qui n’est absolument pas individualiste). Cette efficience émergerait naturellement de la libre opération des marchés dans un contexte marchand (j’invite néanmoins le lecteur à lire <a href="https://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-dette-5000-ans-d-histoire-de-david-graeber">ce que pensent les anthropologues</a> du présupposé naturaliste des économistes sur la monnaie et l’échange marchand). Le libéralisme économique, par conséquent, préconise de réduire l’intervention de l’Etat au strict nécessaire, et peut être associé (ou pas) au libéralisme politique, en particulier la protection des libertés individuelles. Le marché est vu comme un moyen optimal de distribuer l’information dans une économie - bien sûr, aucun économiste sérieux ne considère plus aujourd’hui que les marchés réels se comportent ou puissent se comporter comme les « marchés parfaits » de l’économie néoclassique (voir par exemple le travail de <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_E._Stiglitz">J. Stiglitz</a>). Dans un contexte de guerre froide, ce type d’organisation économique se pense en opposition avec la planification soviétique, qui serait bureaucratique, « sclérosante ».</p>
<p>On touche ici à un problème épistémologique essentiel, sur lequel je reviendrai plus tard, qui constitue l’erreur intellectuelle fondamentale du nouveau management public. En effet, si l’on conçoit qu’un marché puisse exister naturellement dans le cadre d’échanges commerciaux où il existe une métrique objective, l’argent, ce n’est a priori pas le cas de la santé, la science, la justice ou la police. Il faut donc créer ces métriques, par exemple : la durée de séjour, le nombre de publications, le nombre de jugements, le nombre d’amendes. Ces métriques et les objectifs qui y sont associés n’existant pas de manière naturelle (peut-on quantifier la vérité, ou la justice ?), ils doivent être créés par l’Etat. Cela suppose donc la création d’une bureaucratie d’Etat.</p>
<p>On arrive donc à un étonnant paradoxe : alors que le libéralisme est un courant de pensée fondamentalement anti-bureaucratique, on est ici en présence d’une doctrine qui préconise la mise en place d’une bureaucratie d’Etat. C’est en effet une constatation et une plainte récurrentes de tous les chercheurs et universitaires français depuis la mise en place, ces quinze dernières années, de politiques de ce type : alors même qu’il s’agissait officiellement de « moderniser » un appareil d’enseignement et de recherche jugé bureaucratique, « sclérosé », voire proto-soviétique (en particulier dans le cas du CNRS), de l’avis de tous la bureaucratie a au contraire considérablement envahi la vie quotidienne de ces professions, par le biais des multiples appels d’offres et procédures d’évaluation, mais également des nouvelles structures administratives qui ont été créées pour organiser le marché de l’excellence scientifique (HCERES, pôles d’excellence, fusion d’universités, IDEX/LABEX/EQUIPEX/IHU, etc). Ceci se manifeste également dans l’emploi public, puisqu’alors même que le recrutement de chercheurs, d’enseignants-chercheurs et de techniciens est en forte baisse, <a href="http://blog.educpros.fr/guillaume-miquelard-et-paul-francois/2016/08/16/lagence-nationale-de-la-recherche-anr/">l’emploi administratif et donc le coût de gestion</a> ont littéralement explosé au sein de l’ANR, agence chargée d’organiser l’évaluation des appels d’offre en recherche. De même, dans l’hôpital public, une plainte récurrente des médecins concerne le temps considérable qu’ils doivent désormais passer au « codage », c’est-à-dire à assigner à chaque patient et chaque acte des codes issus d’une nomenclature bureaucratique. Cette bureaucratisation n’est pas un accident, comme je l’indiquais précédemment. Elle a été par ailleurs décrite dans le contexte plus large du néolibéralisme par les sciences sociales (voir par exemple le travail de <a href="http://www.editionslesliensquiliberent.fr/livre-Bullshit_Jobs-546-1-1-0-1.html">D. Graeber</a> et de <a href="https://editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-La_bureaucratisation_n__olib__rale-9782707176493.html">B. Hibou</a>).</p>
<p>Manifestement, cette idéologie prétendument libérale est une idéologie bureaucratique, ce qui n’est déjà pas rien. Deuxièmement, le rôle de l’Etat n’est plus du tout d’assurer les libertés individuelles. En effet, dans un marché classique, d’échange marchand, ce qui est produit est décidé de manière autonome (en théorie du moins) par les acteurs de ce marché, c’est-à-dire en dernière analyse (en théorie encore) par les consommateurs. Il faut donc assurer la liberté individuelle de ces acteurs. Or dans le nouveau management public, ce qui est produit est décidé par l’Etat, spécifiquement par la bureaucratie mise en place par l’Etat pour fixer les objectifs, qui utilise la mise en compétition uniquement comme outil de gestion. Il ne s’agit donc absolument plus d’assurer la liberté individuelle des acteurs, qui doivent fournir ce qui leur est demandé par la bureaucratie. Ceux qui ne le font pas doivent quitter le système (exemple du tenure track). C’est ainsi qu’un des points majeurs de ces réformes, en particulier dans la recherche, est de revenir sur le statut de fonctionnaire, qui assure l’autonomie scientifique et universitaire, de façon à pouvoir soumettre les employés à la bureaucratie locale (direction d’université) ou nationale (ministère). Paradoxalement, c’est au nom du libéralisme que l’on attaque les libertés académiques.</p>
<p>On est donc en présence d’une idéologie qui est fondamentalement bureaucratique, et qui n’entend pas garantir les libertés individuelles. Pour ce qui est du libéralisme politique, on ne peut que constater également qu’il n’y a pas grand-chose de libéral dans la pratique actuelle des institutions politiques (avec par exemple le recours généralisé aux ordonnances pour passer des réformes majeures), dans la <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/01/11/les-violences-policieres-sont-le-reflet-d-un-echec_6025530_3232.html">répression violente des opposants politiques</a>, dans <a href="https://rsf.org/fr/actualites/violences-commises-envers-les-journalistes-en-france-rsf-lance-un-cri-dalarme">l’intimidation des journalistes</a>, dans la volonté de <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2020/01/16/lettre-commune-contre-la-loi-haine/">censurer les réseaux sociaux</a>, dans la <a href="http://www.sauvonsluniversite.com/spip.php?article8599">restriction de la liberté d’expression des étudiants et universitaires</a>, ou encore dans le <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/medias/la-reconnaissance-faciale-debarque-en-france-et-vous-ny-echapperez-pas,n6459175.php">déploiement de la reconnaissance faciale</a> automatique par l’Etat.</p>
<p>Que reste-t-il donc du libéralisme dans cette idéologie ? Peu de choses en effet. C’est la raison pour laquelle les historiens, <a href="https://editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-La_bureaucratisation_n__olib__rale-9782707176493.html">sociologues</a> et <a href="http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Il-faut-s-adapter">philosophes</a> parlent de néolibéralisme (à ne pas confondre avec l’ultralibéralisme), et c’est également la raison pour laquelle ses partisans refusent typiquement cette étiquette de manière véhémente, quand bien même il s’agit d’une dénomination savante, parce qu’elle indique que l’on a affaire à tout à fait autre chose que du libéralisme. Ce malentendu sur la nature prétendument libérale (au sens classique) de cette idéologie est source de grande confusion. Il explique peut-être l’opposition quasi-systématique d’une grande partie de la population à des réformes pourtant portées par des gouvernements centristes élus, y compris élus par des membres du monde académique qui se considèrent de centre gauche.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em> L’obscurantisme managérial</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il existe pour les universitaires et chercheurs une raison spécifique de s’opposer à cette idéologie, en lien avec l’éthique intellectuelle qu’ils entendent défendre par leur métier. Il s’agit en effet d’une idéologie qui repose sur une argumentation d’un niveau intellectuel affligeant (suite de poncifs et de préjugés non étayés), des analogies douteuses (le marché, voire le darwinisme), et un refus de toute évaluation empirique (depuis son application, l’hôpital public est en crise grave et la recherche française tombe dans les classements mis en avant par les autorités elles-mêmes). Autrement dit, une idéologie obscurantiste tendant vers le sectaire. Les discours portant cette idéologie font rire toute la communauté académique tellement ils sont caricaturaux de novlangue : tout doit être « excellent », il faut faire « sauter des verrous », favoriser « l’innovation disruptive ». Il faut consulter l’hilarant site de <a href="http://excellagence.fr/">l’Agence Nationale de l’Excellence Scientifique</a>, parodiant l’Agence Nationale de la Recherche.</p>
<p>Il vaut mieux en rire, sans doute, mais ces discours n’en sont pas moins affligeants. L’argumentation que l’on retrouve dans les rapports officiels et les contrats d’objectifs des différentes institutions ne sont malheureusement pas d’un niveau intellectuel plus élevé. Il s’agirait par exemple de s’aligner sur les « standards internationaux » - un mimétisme censé favorisé l’innovation, ce qui est assez croustillant. On ne s’est visiblement pas posé la question de dresser un bilan de ces politiques menées à l’étranger ou en France, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00101-9">qui n’est pourtant pas brillant</a>. Quelle est donc la justification en ce qui concerne l’enseignement supérieur et la recherche ? On peut la paraphraser ainsi : puisque ces politiques ont été implémentées dans les pays anglo-saxons, en particulier les Etats-Unis, et que les Etats-Unis sont leaders dans tous les classements, c’est donc que ces politiques sont efficaces : il faut donc s’empresser de copier ce modèle.</p>
<p>N’importe quel scientifique devrait bondir face à une telle argumentation qui mélange corrélation et causation de la manière la plus grossière qui soit. On aurait pu se dire : tiens, les Etats-Unis étant politiquement hégémoniques, toute la science se fait dans leur langue maternelle, dans des revues toutes anglo-saxonnes, et qui plus est avec des moyens sans commune mesure avec les budgets français. Peut-être que ces facteurs ont une petite influence ? On aurait pu se dire : tiens, peut-être que les grandes universités américaines sont mondialement connues au-delà du monde académique, alors que l’Ecole Polytechnique pas tellement, parce que les Etats-Unis sont culturellement hégémoniques, de sorte que Legally Blonde a été tourné à Harvard et pas à Assas ? Auquel cas il ne serait peut-être pas si pertinent de faire tellement d’efforts à renommer toutes les universités parisiennes en déclinant la marque Sorbonne ? On aurait pu se dire encore : tiens, peut-être que les Etats-Unis ont un excellent vivier scientifique précisément parce que des pays comme la France imposent à tous leurs meilleurs docteurs de passer plusieurs années aux Etats-Unis pour se former parmi les meilleurs, se « faire un réseau », apprendre l’anglais, comme condition pour une éventuelle titularisation dans leur pays d’origine ? Mais, on ne s’est rien dit de tout ça. Ce qui marche, c’est le « marché » et la compétition généralisée. Point.</p>
<p>Sur certains points, il existe des études scientifiques qui vont au-delà des sophismes managériaux. Par exemple, est-il plus efficace de concentrer les ressources sur les « meilleurs » ? Même si l’on adopte les critères bureaucratiques promus par l’idéologie managériale (nombre de publications, etc), la réponse est, selon plusieurs études sur des données différentes : non. Il est plus efficace de diversifier les financements que de les concentrer en créant de grosses structures (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686789/">Fortin &amp; Curie, 2013</a> ; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465944/">Cook et al., 2015</a> ; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07396">Mongeon et al., 2016</a> ; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882298/">Wahls, 2018</a>). D’autres études montrent que la sélection sur projet n’est que faiblement prédictive de l’impact scientifique, tel que mesuré par ces mêmes politiques (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/13323v1">Fang et al., 2016</a> ; <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/13.WB.017">Scheiner &amp; Bouchie, 2013</a>). Manifestement, les décideurs politiques de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche ne sont pas intéressés par l’évaluation empirique de leurs théories. Il est donc approprié de qualifier cette attitude d’obscurantiste. Et on ne peut pas, on ne doit pas, en tant que scientifiques (au sens large), respecter l’obscurantisme, c’est-à-dire le mépris de l’éthique intellectuelle qui fait l’essence de notre métier.</p>
<p>Il est important de noter que ces politiques se présentent volontiers comme « rationnelles » - il ne s’agirait finalement que de dérouler des arguments peut-être déplaisants mais « logiques ». Ce mot, « rationnel », devrait être un signal d’alarme pour tous les intellectuels. Car un intellectuel doit savoir que la logique, la raison, se déploient nécessairement au sein d’un certain modèle du monde. Par conséquent, la vérité d’un raisonnement est conditionnée à la pertinence empirique et théorique de ce modèle. C’est pourquoi l’essence de la science (au sens large) est le débat argumenté, documenté et honnête, c’est-à-dire explicitant les hypothèses, épaulé par les institutions sociales adéquates (comme la revue par les pairs). Passer sous silence cet aspect, et prétendre qu’il existerait une Vérité objective, c’est faire preuve de sectarisme, et en effet d’obscurantisme puisque cela suppose d’ignorer délibérément toute production savante contraire à la doxa.</p>
<p>L’enjeu pour la communauté académique, donc, n’est pas simplement d’aménager à la marge des réformes prétendument démocratiques (augmenter le taux de succès de l’ANR) ou de les « négocier » (on accepte la précarisation en échange de primes), mais de s’opposer à l’obscurantisme qui fonde ces projets, et éventuellement de penser autre chose à la place.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em> Pensée bureaucratique et idéologies sectaires</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il faut rappeler ici qu’avant la guerre froide, la bureaucratie a volontiers été présentée sur un mode laudatif. Le sociologue Max Weber, par exemple, considérait en se référant à la bureaucratie industrielle qu’il s’agissait là d’un mode particulièrement efficace de production, rationnel. De même la planification soviétique était pensée comme une approche scientifique, rationnelle, de la production (algorithmique, pourrait-on peut-être dire en langage moderne). La bureaucratie instituée par le nouveau management public n’échappe pas à ce type de discours. Je reviendrai plus tard sur les raisons fondamentales pour laquelle l’approche bureaucratique ne peut pas fonctionner pour des activités telles que la science (ou la santé). Un point intéressant relevé par l’historien Johann Chapoutot est que les politiques similaires au nouveau management public menées par le IIIe Reich étaient, contrairement à l’image d’efficacité que l’on en a à cause de la propagande nazie, en réalité tout à fait inefficaces, chaotiques.</p>
<p>J’ai mentionné rapidement les similarités idéologiques, naturellement sur certains aspects uniquement, avec la politique nazie et avec la bureaucratie soviétique. J’ai également mentionné en passant l’inquiétante insistance des dirigeants politiques à instaurer une « culture du résultat », c’est-à-dire qu’il s’agit non seulement d’instaurer de nouvelles structures étatiques, mais également de transformer les individus pour qu’ils embrassent la nouvelle orientation politique. Ce n’est pas sans rappeler la « révolution culturelle » maoïste, visant à éradiquer les valeurs culturelles traditionnelles (naturellement, avec des moyens violents que je ne prétends pas comparer à l’action publique actuelle).</p>
<p>Pour qu’il n’y ait pas de malentendu, il ne s’agit pas de dire que la théorie du nouveau management public est une idéologie nazie, ou stalinienne, ou maoïste (celles-ci étant de toutes façons incompatibles). D’ailleurs, il semble plausible que M. Petit, lorsqu’il considère maladroitement que la loi doit être inégalitaire et « darwinienne », ignore qu’il formule là la doctrine du <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinisme_social">darwinisme social</a>, un fondement essentiel du néolibéralisme <a href="http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Il-faut-s-adapter">comme l’a montré la philosophe Barbara Stiegler</a>, mais également un des fondements idéologiques du nazisme. Il n’est pas question ici de mettre sur le même plan les horreurs commises au nom de ces courants de pensée avec la destruction des constructions sociales commises au nom du nouveau management public. Néanmoins, sur un plan intellectuel, les points communs avec ces idéologies sectaires doivent nous interroger. Il existe bien un recouvrement idéologique partiel dont on peut tout à fait comprendre les aspects problématiques. Par exemple, la promotion de la compétition généralisée des individus dans un but supérieur, les individus eux-mêmes n’ayant de valeur que dans la mesure où ils contribuent à la puissance de la Nation (ainsi la référence constante à la compétition internationale, aux classements internationaux, aux « stars » qu’il faudrait attirer) ; position qui rend inopérant tout argument de type social (par exemple la précarisation extrême du métier de chercheur), mais aussi scientifique (c’est-à-dire que le but premier de la science est la recherche de la vérité et non la production). Il ne s’agit donc pas de nazisme, de maoïsme ou stalinisme, mais il reviendra néanmoins aux défenseurs de ce projet politique d’argumenter que « tout n’est pas à jeter » dans ces grandes idéologies sectaires. Que toute activité sociale doit contribuer exclusivement à la production de la Nation. Que les opinions et attitudes des gens doivent être transformées pour le bien de la Nation. Que la bureaucratie, c’est efficace et rationnel.</p>
<p>En résumé, il ne faut pas passer à côté des enjeux de la transformation en cours de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de discuter du taux optimal de succès à l’ANR mais de contester la pertinence du projet comme mode essentiel d’organisation de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de discuter des métriques les plus pertinentes pour évaluer les personnes, mais de contester l’organisation profondément bureaucratique que cette « culture de l’évaluation » suppose, et de réaffirmer l’autonomie académique nécessaire à l’exercice de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de savoir comment au mieux renforcer l’« attractivité internationale » du métier, mais de contester l’idée d’un progrès scientifique fondé essentiellement sur la compétition et la sélection - plutôt que, par exemple, sur la coopération, l’éducation et le partage. Il ne s’agit pas, enfin, de se demander comment favoriser au mieux l’« innovation de rupture », mais de contester l’idée selon laquelle l’activité scientifique doit être subordonnée à la production marchande.</p>
<p>Il s’agit donc en premier lieu de dénoncer l’obscurantisme et le sectarisme qui fondent ces réformes, et non de les négocier en acceptant leurs présupposés. En second lieu, il s’agira de penser les questions centrales de science et d’université dans un cadre intellectuel libéré du sectarisme managérial.</p>
<p>Toutes ces remarques sont finalement assez peu spécifiques de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche. Par la suite, je tenterai de rentrer dans une discussion plus spécifique, en particulier sur la nécessaire autonomie de la science, à mettre en regard avec la culture du projet.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Researchers from tech company DeepMind have drawn inspiration from their own AI research to develop a new theory of how reinforcement learning works in the brain. </strong>Dopamine neurons respond to the difference between a predicted reward and the reward that an animal actually receives: so if the reward is greater than predicted, for instance, more dopamine will be released. But the team found that dopamine neurons in mice don’t all produce the same level of response, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2230327-deepmind-found-an-ai-learning-technique-also-works-in-human-brains/">reports Donna Lu at </a><em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2230327-deepmind-found-an-ai-learning-technique-also-works-in-human-brains/">New Scientist</a> — </em>instead, they show a distribution of responses, similar to techniques used in machine learning.</p>

<p><strong>The parasite <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>can only reproduce in the digestive tract of cats, so it’s developed an ingenious solution: when it infects the brains of rats and mice, it makes them less scared of felines. But a new study suggests that <em>T. gondii</em> isn’t the “genius” it was previously believed to be</strong>. Instead, researchers have found that the parasite causes rodents to lose fear towards predators generally, rather than cats specifically, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/brain-parasite-may-strip-away-rodents-fear-predators-not-just-cats">reports Kelly Servick at <em>Science</em></a> <em>—</em> though not everyone is convinced by the findings.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>An increasing body of psychological literature suggests that meditation and mindfulness may boost feelings of empathy and altruism (</strong><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/12/the-psychology-of-mindfulness-digested/"><strong>though it is not without its downsides</strong></a><strong>).</strong> If that’s the case, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/10/21013234/meditation-brain-neuroscience-moral-obligation">asks Sigal Samuel at <em>Vox</em></a>, do we all have a moral obligation to start meditating?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>“Super-recognisers” <em>—</em> people who are particularly adept at recognising faces <em>—</em> are often employed by the police and border agencies. But recent studies reveal their skills are limited when it comes to recognising people of different ethnic groups. </strong>Researchers found that white super-recognisers were better than white controls at recognising Egyptian and Asian faces <em>—</em> but they were still worse than native Egyptian or Asian non-super-recognisers. “[A]gencies seeking to recruit super-recognisers will see a performance boost,” <a href="https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-research-reveals-new-abilities-of-super-recognisers-128414">write the researchers at </a><em><a href="https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-research-reveals-new-abilities-of-super-recognisers-128414">The Conversation</a>. “</em>But if they are assessing a particular ethnic group, they will need to seek the help of native observers as well.”</p>

<p><strong>“Environmental issues are not just technical challenges that can be solved with a new invention. To tackle climate change we will need insight from psychology and sociology. Scientific and technological innovations are necessary, but enabling them to make an impact requires an understanding of how people adapt and change their behaviour.” </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00064-x">At <em>Nature</em>, Hetan Shah welcomes recent calls</a> for scientists to be at the heart of the civil service <em>— </em>but cautions<span> </span><span>that the government should not overlook the vital role of experts from the humanities and social sciences.</span></p>

Please also consider voicing your support on social media with the hashtag #OAintheUSA.</em></p>
<p>Dear President Trump,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned organizations, represent leading publishers and non-profit scientific and scholarly societies registered in the United States, or with employees in the United States. We write to you in support of the proposed Administration policy that would mandate immediate open distribution of peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on federally-funded research. We also write to call into question some of the points made in the letter from the Association of American Publishers (AAP) dated December 18, 2019, and to make clear that not all American publishers support the position of this AAP letter.</p>
<p>As organizations involved in the coordination, organization, enhancement, and dissemination of peer-reviewed research, we work in close collaboration with the stakeholders funding research, the stakeholders performing research, and the stakeholders reading research. All of these groups have a say in how scientific publishing should work, and all of these groups include the U.S. Federal Government and the researchers it funds.</p>
<p>Our business interests are important, but must be considered in the context of this nation’s collaborative research industry and community. If an important change that benefits the American taxpaying public emerges, it is up to stakeholders to support it, even if it includes some change and some risk. This is one of the pillars of the American work ethic — innovation and perseverance during change.</p>
<p>We the undersigned all operate, or partner with, successful publishing businesses which have pioneered, or are transitioning to, the new open publishing paradigm. We all consider the immediate and open dissemination of federally-funded research a priority, and we enable it via effective business models. There is nothing about the immediate availability of research that precludes publishing companies — commercial or nonprofit — from continuing to do business if they work hard, innovate, and collaborate. In fact, the immediate and open availability of research is an important prerequisite to another Administration priority — the Artificial Intelligence (AI) readiness of federally-funded research to maintain and “drive growth of the United States economy, enhance our economic and national security, and improve our quality of life.”</p>
<p>The Federal Government has long funded research that triggers further innovation and economic development when it can be built upon. The entrepreneurial ecosystem enabled by opening access to this research far outweighs its economic value as intellectual property of selected publishing companies and societies. Therefore we take issue with the notion from the AAP letter that it is the business success of a group of publishers that best showcases the strength of American science and research. As the AAP letter states, “the role of the publisher is to advance scholarship and innovation, fostering the American leadership in science that drives our economy and global competitiveness.” However, our approach will serve this agenda more fully. The U.S. will best lead the world by showcasing its research for everyone, including the Americans taxpayers who have funded it, to learn from and build on. You cannot showcase the quality of federally-funded research to its full potential by limiting access to it.</p>
<p>Additionally, the value and benefits of opening up research to be read and built upon should by now be self-evident: consider doctors dealing with disease outbreaks needing the most up-to-date information possible; patients making informed healthcare choices; teachers and students, wherever they are, accessing the wealth of US-funded knowledge; small business owners accessing the cutting edge of technology; farmers understanding the most recent research on crops. These are, as a reminder, also the people who have funded the research with their tax dollars.</p>
<p>A peer-reviewed article, whether published via an AAP signatory, or a signatory of this letter, is ultimately authored and peer-reviewed by the same research community. There is nothing, therefore, contained in your proposed policy that jeopardizes the quality and integrity of American research. This research will continue to be performed and peer-reviewed by the same people, to the same high standards as before — it will simply be disseminated for the benefit of the American people and the entire research community more cost-effectively, immediately, and openly.</p>
<p>Such executive orders or policies do not “undermine” the marketplace. The Federal Government, as a funder and participant in the American research community, is an integral part of this marketplace and is free to state its priorities. We, the undersigned, look forward to continued collaboration with the Federal Government, and researchers supported by it, and to continuing to disseminate the outcomes of this world-class activity as openly as possible.</p>
<p>We support this policy and urge you to put the needs and rights of the research community and American taxpaying public first, and help us serve this community in the way it clearly wishes to be served.</p>

The journal Diabetes has retracted two 2006 papers by a group of researchers in Germany whose work has long been the subject of concerns about image duplication and manipulation.  The first author of the articles is Kathrin Maedler, a prominent diabetes specialist at the University of Bremen, where she’d been a named professor but lost … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/17/tired-of-waiting-for-a-university-a-publisher-commissions-its-own-investigation-and-retracts-two-papers/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Tired of waiting for a university,  a publisher commissions its own investigation — and retracts two papers</span></a>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/V0r5mKoF8tk/">Peer Review in Service of Open Science</a></h4>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we think about Open Science, sharing a diverse array of research products—such as data, code, methods, reagents—immediately comes to mind. More fundamentally, Open Science is about the entire process of conducting and communicating science according to long-established norms. Openness is </span><a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/sape/2012-06-20-saoe.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the heart of scientific enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scientists adopt open practices to allow collaboration and critical scrutiny, so that knowledge can be validated and built upon for the common good. The publishing process should be a central element ensuring that these norms are maintained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve considered how our submission and peer-review processes at PLOS can be improved upon to facilitate Open Science: we have made several changes over the past year and a half and we continue to explore new possibilities. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>BUILDING BLOCKS OF AN OPEN PROCESS</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Start with a preprint!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year and a half ago, we introduced a new step in the submission process: we ask authors if they have deposited a preprint and if they haven’t, we offer to do it on their behalf. We have </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered with bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deposit preprints after they have been screened by our staff—to make sure they are in scope and there are no ethical concerns or sensitive information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being open about a manuscript when it is submitted rather than published can make researchers wary (as some authors indicate in our surveys) but it does offer many </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It creates opportunities for collaboration and it helps researchers show their work before it is published, which is particularly important for those needing to demonstrate productivity for a thesis, or a job or grant application. Releasing a preprint has </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article. At the moment, close to 20% of manuscripts considered at PLOS have a preprint at submission (compared to </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256298#.Xh_OaBdKg0o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3% across PubMed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with some communities particularly embracing this aspect of Open Science (e.g., over 50% of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Computational Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submissions are preprinted). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to share a pre-print of an article via bioRxiv allows for other researchers to start building off your findings…without delay. Furthermore, the open-access nature of the bioRxiv pre-prints opens the peer-review process to the entire scientific community, thus facilitating the incorporation of constructive feedback into your work.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Nathan Robinson, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Author</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Publish peer reviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer review occupies an important function in the culture of objective critique that characterizes Open Science. The back and forth between authors and reviewers helps to validate claims and improve their reporting—it is a service to authors and readers alike. Exposing what happens during peer review increases the value of this exchange for all. Volunteer reviewers, along with editors, provide an enormous service to the scientific community; publishing the peer review history (with a DOI for unambiguous citation) is a step towards having this activity recognized and peer review reports viewed as a first-rate academic output. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May of last year, we launched the option for authors to publish the full </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside their article. While we hope that the community will gradually move to more openness, our initial implementation allows reviewers to remain anonymous, and lets authors opt in at acceptance, when the peer review has been concluded. We are heartened by the response—within six months of launching the option, an average of 40% of authors opt in across all journals, with 60-70% opt-in rate in certain disciplines, and 55% of published peer review packages have at least one named reviewer. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open peer review helps build public trust in the process by removing the mystery of secret academic peer review, as well as showing the robustness of the method in action.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Thomas Shafee, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> Author</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>CONTINUING TO RETHINK PEER REVIEW</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all its important functions, peer review remains imperfect and faces new challenges. It is increasingly difficult for only two to three reviewers to evaluate all aspects of complex interdisciplinary manuscripts.  Expanding the group of experts who provide feedback would likely be beneficial in many cases but is difficult in practice. In addition, the process is prone to delays and redundancy when a manuscript goes through multiple rounds of revision—either within a journal or more commonly through successive cycles of submission – review – revision – rejection at different journals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these building blocks in place—publishing preprints and peer review history—we have started to  experiment with new peer review ideas. Through 2020 we will be tracking the progress of three new initiatives: </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>1. From a peer review workflow that supports preprints to a preprint workflow that supports peer review</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are facilitating the deposition of preprints; can we close the loop and harness in the peer review process the attention that other experts are paying to the preprint? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking this question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on four PLOS journals now. We alert authors at submission that when  comments are posted on their preprint, we will bring them to the attention of the handling editor.  According to </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bioRxiv survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 37% of respondents received comments on their preprints via email. We hope that with the understanding that their comments may help and accelerate peer review, commentators will be more willing to make these comments public on bioRxiv. The comments do not need to be full blown reviews, but perhaps relevant examination of specific aspects—statistics, methodology, code, etc. As we surface a more diverse array of comments to the editors, and also point to comments on twitter, </span><a href="https://www.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PREreview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://prelights.biologists.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preLights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (two third-party sites providing reviews of preprints), we will examine the impact of this diversity on the experience of authors and editors. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>2. Journal-independent peer review to reduce reviewer burden</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five PLOS journals are </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new service by EMBO Press and ASAPbio that offers journal-independent peer review. With a round of reviews in hand, authors might be better equipped to select a journal, and all participating journals commit to using the service’s reviews to expedite publication decisions. Authors may also decide that their manuscript is sufficiently validated and use Review Commons’s service to post peer reviews on bioRxiv. We look forward to learning about new behaviors and understanding how peer review of preprints can be most effective—with or without a journal publication outcome. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>3. Peer reviewing the experimental plan</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2020/01/14/registered-reports-are-coming-to-plos-one/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they will be offering Registered Reports as an option for publishing hypothesis-testing studies. This article type, with two stages of peer review and subsequent publications, is particularly important </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02674-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to avoid publication bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By segmenting peer review into two stages, the authors get early feedback on their initial research plan in order to craft a robust and reproducible study design before they begin their investigation, and they also get a guarantee that their results will be published in the journal so long as they adhere to the study protocol. Registered reports provide greater transparency in assessment criteria, minimize biases and help make the entire research process more open by revealing key stages of work, earlier.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>OPEN QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three initiatives examine different aspects of peer review. We hope to learn about the effectiveness of different models and attitudes towards them, in order to design improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are encouraged to be in good company in this experimentation—consider the twelve other community-based journals participating in </span><a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the registry of initiatives </span><a href="https://reimaginereview.asapbio.org/explore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reimagine Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintained by </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASAPbio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/e9091cea/peer-review-new-initiatives-to-enhance-the-value-of-elife-s-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiatives from eLife</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vision </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">articulated by HHMI leadership about the future of publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting question for all to consider remains how to express the substance of peer review in ways that help readers make decisions about what to read, to incorporate into their own research, and to inform research assessment. The current overreliance on journal name is problematic because in so many ways it is a blunt tool, inadequate for representing the richness of evaluation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is much more we can learn about how to improve peer review and how we can distill the journal process and reapply it in valuable ways—and it is our duty as publishers to continue this exploration for the benefit of all. </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/shopper-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With consumers now more health conscious than ever before, nutrition food labels are becoming increasingly important to help us choose between products.</p>
<p>In light of recent advances in nutritional science with regards to the link between diet and chronic diseases such as heart disease, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016 published rules on the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods which will facilitate consumers in making informed decisions when it comes to food choice. By January 1<sup>st</sup> this year, manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual sales must have switched to the new label. Those with less than $10 million in annual sales have until January 1<sup>st</sup> 2021 to comply.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11581" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/NutritionLabel-1-257x300.jpg" width="257" />With the new <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/133699/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nutrition labeling rules</a> kicking in this year, consumers will be seeing labels which reflect how Americans actually eat. One of the requirements listed in these rules states that the first column of the label must list nutrition information based on the serving size for the product and the second column based on the entire contents of the package.</p>
<p><strong>Do nutrition labels influence healthier food choices?</strong></p>
<p>There is little information on how food labels are used in real-life shopping situations, or how they affect dietary choices and patterns. It is important for consumers to understand what nutrition claims mean so that informed decisions on product choice can be made, supporting the argument that smarter labels and smarter policies are needed to make healthy eating the cheaper and more widely available choice.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7622-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">systematic review</a> recently published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> examined the evidence that nutrition claims relating to fat, sugar, and energy content influence energy intake and food choices. The study’s results suggest that these claims can shape the knowledge of consumers with respect to perceived healthfulness of products, as well as the expected and experienced tastiness of food products. Furthermore, nutrition claims can also make the appropriate portion size appear to be larger and lead to an underestimation of the energy content of food products.</p>
<p><strong>Front-of-package nutrition labeling</strong></p>
<p>With the increased public interest in identifying healthier foods, U.S. food processors have been adding nutritional <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11582 alignleft" height="163" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Nutriscore-300x163.png" width="300" />information to the front of packages (FoP) in addition to nutrient content or health claims, a type of labeling also seen in other countries. Examples include symbols that broadly suggest that a food is “healthy,” “good for you,” or “a better choice.” and symbols that purport to list on the front of the packages the key nutrients in that food.</p>
<p>Chile was the first country worldwide to implement a FoP warning label and several countries have followed this model. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7118-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> describing the process of development for the Chilean FoP warning label looks at the visualization, understanding, and ability to modify intended purchase of different prototypes of warning labels. A black-&amp;-white stop sign with a simple text indicating ‘Excess of &lt;nutrient&gt;’ was identified as the best option to implement a warning message in the context of the Chilean Food Labeling and Marketing Law. In June 2016, the Chilean government implemented this FoP warning label (amending it to ‘High in &lt;nutrient&gt;’) and several countries such as Uruguay, Peru, and Israel have approved the implementation of warning labels similar to this one.</p>

<p>Research suggests that consumers like FOP labeling, finding it to be a time-saver. In a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-8108-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Public Health</a>, </em>Jorge Vargas-Meza and colleagues compared the acceptability and understanding of labels used in Latin-America among low- and middle-income Mexican adults. The participants were assigned to one of three labels: Mexican Guideline Daily Allowances (GDA), Ecuador’s Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), or Chile’s Warning Labels (WL) in red.  The time participants took to choose the product was measured, as well as the differences in label acceptability and understanding. The GDA, which indicates the grams and percentages (according to the guideline-based daily intakes) per portion of kilocalories, saturated fats, other fats, sugars, and sodium, had the lowest acceptability and understanding among the labels tested. The MTL and the WL were more accepted and understood, and allowed low- and middle-income consumers to make nutrition-quality related decisions more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Can food labels affect health behavior?</strong></p>
<p>Calorie-only food labels at points of food purchase have had limited success in motivating people to change eating behaviors and increase physical activity. Christopher B. Deery and colleagues set out to examine changes in physical activity in participants exposed to activity-based food labels compared to those seeing standard calorie-only labels in their worksite cafeteria. The results of the <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7960-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> suggest small positive effects for the Physical Activity Calorie Expenditure (PACE) labels on self-reported (~ 20% increase) and objective (~ 6% increase) physical activity. While the overall effects are modest, the results support the need for additional study on factors that may interact with intervention effects. The study also highlights the possibility that women and men respond differently to food labels.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11585" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/foodchoice-277x300.jpg" width="277" />A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6496-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilot randomized controlled trial</a> carried out in Singapore used an experimental web-based grocery store to test two FoP warning labels intended to reduce purchases of products high in sugar. The first label is an English language version similar to the one used in Chile, that shows a black stop sign with the words ‘<em>high-in-sugar’</em> in the center. The second label is a text-based health warning label which is similar to labels considered in several municipalities in the US and also resembles the warning label on cigarettes, but without the accompanying graphics. The text-based health warning label generated a statistically significant reduction in labelled products purchased, suggesting that FoP warning labels have the potential to reduce demand for products high in sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, nutrition claims labels may also be used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy.</p>
<p>The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on the processing of nutrients and fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable. It should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11586" height="189" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/juice-300x189.jpg" width="300" />Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts on healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.</p>
<p>With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5528-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labeled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.</p>
<p>The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Increased regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.</p>
<p><strong>Eating out</strong></p>
<p>As eating out has now become very common, and food served outside of the home is often of low nutritional quality, the FDA also oversees food labeling in restaurant menus.</p>
<p>Although kilocalorie (kcal) labeling of food and drink products sold in restaurant chains in the US is now mandatory, in store kcal labeling practices among major UK restaurant and takeaway chains have not been examined. In August 2018, researchers based at the University of Liverpool contacted, visited the website and/or retail outlets of major eating out and takeaway food chains in the UK, including full-service and fast-food restaurants, cafes and coffee shops. They examined the proportion of chains providing kcal information to customers at point of choice in store and the extent to which kcal information provision adhered to labeling recommendations. They <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7017-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that it is rare for eating out and takeaway chains in the UK to provide point of choice kcal labeling and when labeling is provided it does not adhere to recommended labeling practices.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11587 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/menu-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Calorie information alone may not be sufficient to motivate behavior change, especially when making a decision at the point of purchase (such as in a fast food or cafeteria line) where distractions and time-pressures are common. Physical activity equivalents provided with calorie information may provide increased motivation for healthier food choice as previous research suggests that calorie information alone may not be sufficient for behavior change. Anthony J. Viera et. al. explored this idea in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6433-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> examining the effect of PACE food labels compared to calorie-only labels on point-of-decision food purchasing in three worksite cafeterias in North Carolina. They found that cafeteria patrons exposed to PACE labels during their workday lunch did not purchase any fewer calories than those exposed to calorie-only labels. Future studies in alternative settings, especially fast food restaurants, are called for in order to determine whether physical activity equivalents are a useful addition to existing calorie information in order to provide the extra motivation required to make a healthier food choice.</p>

<p>Is it really believable that Hillary Clinton operated a child sex ring out of a pizza shop — or that Donald Trump was prepared to deport his wife, Melania, after a fight at the White House? Though both these headlines seem obviously false, they were shared millions of times on social media.</p>
<p>The sharing of misinformation — including such blatantly false “fake news” — is of course a serious problem. According to a popular interpretation of why it happens, when deciding what to share, social media users don’t care if a “news” item is true or not, so long as it furthers their own agenda: that is, we are in a “post-truth” era. One recent study suggested, for example, that knowing something is false <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/12/the-more-we-see-fake-news-the-more-likely-we-are-to-share-it/">has little impact on the likelihood of sharing</a>. However, a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/3n9u8">new paper</a> by a team of researchers from MIT and the University of Regina in Canada further challenges that bleak view.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The studies reported in the paper, available as a preprint on <em>PsyArXiv</em>, suggest that in fact, social media users <i>do </i>care whether an item is accurate or not — they just get distracted by other motives (such as wanting to secure new followers or likes) when deciding what to share. As part of their study, the researchers also showed that a simple intervention that targeted a group of oblivious Twitter users increased the quality of the news that they shared. “Our results translate directly into a scalable anti-misinformation intervention that is easily implementable by social media platforms,” they write.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38917"></span></p>
<p>For the first study, Gordon Pennycook and colleagues presented more than 1,000 online participants with the headlines, initial sentences and accompanying images of 36 actual news stories taken from social media. (They didn’t use full stories as research shows that people often share news stories without clicking through to the full text.) Half of these stories were true and half were false. Also, half were favourable to Republicans and half to Democrats. Some participants were asked to judge whether each headline was accurate. The others were asked if they’d consider sharing the story online.</p>
<p>The headlines of genuine stories received much higher accuracy ratings than the false headlines, and participants were only slightly more likely to rate headlines that supported their own political ideology as being accurate than those that conflicted with it. However, they were also only slightly more likely to consider sharing true rather than false headlines, and much more likely to consider sharing headlines that agreed with their political opinions.</p>
<p>For example, only 15.7 % of Republicans rated the headline: “Over 500 ‘Migrant Caraveners’ Arrested with Suicide Vests” as being accurate, but 51.1% said they would consider sharing it. “Together these results indicate that our participants can effectively identify the accuracy of true versus false headlines when asked to do so — but they are nonetheless willing to share many false headlines that align with their partisanship,” the researches write.</p>
<p>So far, the results were potentially consistent with the post-truth interpretation. However, a questionnaire administered at the end of this study revealed that most people thought it was “extremely important” to share only accurate news. (Only 7.9% said it was “not at all important”.)</p>
<p>Further studies on a total of more than 2,700 online participants revealed that prompting them to simply think about whether a particular headline was accurate or not made them less likely to consider sharing false headlines (and this effect was even stronger for headlines that were congruent with their own political leanings).</p>
<p>For the final study, the researchers identified 5,482 Twitter users who had previously shared links to websites that professional fact-checkers have rated as being highly untrustworthy. These users were sent a message, asking their opinion on the accuracy of a non-political headline, lead paragraph and image. The team then analysed which news stories these people shared over the following 24 hours.</p>
<p>They found small but significant effects, with increases in the quality of the news sources that the users subsequently shared, compared with before the message intervention. The researchers noted an increase in the proportion of high quality stories (from the <em>New York Times</em>, for example) and a decrease in posts from relatively untrustworthy, politically hyper-partisan sources. “In sum, our accuracy message successfully induced Twitter users who regularly shared misinformation to increase the quality of the news they shared,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest firstly that just because someone shares a piece of fake news on social media, it doesn’t mean that they necessarily believe it or endorse it. Also, importantly, “our results suggest that many people mistakenly choose to share misinformation because they were merely distracted from considering the content’s accuracy.” Future work should explore which motives (such as gaining followers, for example) are most relevant to this, they add.</p>
<p>The work also suggests that simple interventions could help to improve the quality of items that are shared. In the future, social media platforms might intermittently ask users to rate the accuracy of randomly-selected headlines, which could bring accuracy to the forefront of users’ minds, they suggest. “Approaches such as the one we propose could potentially increase the quality of news circulating online without relying on a centralised institution to certify truth and censor falsehood,” they conclude.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that actor again? The one who was on that show? Oh, it’s right on the tip of my tongue..!”</p>
<p>That “tip-of-the-tongue” state — where we feel that we’re <em>just</em> on the verge of recalling a word or name — is probably familiar to us all. And it’s been the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/28/why-words-get-stuck-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue-and-how-to-stop-it-recurring/">subject of much research</a> by psycholinguists, who think it happens when we’re able to retrieve a concept or meaning, but not translate that into the letters and sounds of a word.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13421-019-00993-7">new study in <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em></a> has found that when people experience tip-of-the-tongue states, they also become more likely to take risks — suggesting that the phenomenon can exert a surprising influence on completely unrelated behaviour.</p>
<p><span id="more-38902"></span></p>
<p>Researchers already knew that tip-of-the-tongue states were associated with a “positivity bias”. When people are unable to recall a word or name, but feel like they are on the verge of getting it, they are more likely to believe that that word is positive, for instance, or that the name belongs to an ethical person.</p>
<p>This might seem paradoxical, given that the phenomenon is often accompanied by a sense of frustration — but researchers have suggested that there is also a positive element to the experience. Compared to a complete inability to recall a word, having it on the tip of your tongue might give a sense of excitement, or an encouraging feeling that you have relevant knowledge, even if you can’t quite bring it to mind. So, the logic goes, people may mistakenly infer from these feelings that the word itself has positive qualities.</p>
<p>But does this bias also influence other decisions that are unrelated to the word? To investigate this possibility, Anne Cleary and colleagues at Colorado State University conducted a series of studies on how the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon related to people’s risk-taking decisions: specifically, whether or not they chose to gamble.</p>
<p>First, the team asked 19 students to answer 80 general knowledge questions, such as “What is the name of Dorothy’s dog in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>?”. If they couldn’t answer, the participants indicated whether they were experiencing a tip-of-the-tongue state. Then after each question, they rated on a scale of 0 to 10 whether they felt inclined to gamble on the result of a coin-toss.</p>
<p>On average, participants failed to answer around 44 of the questions; of these, they experienced the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon for about 8 (if you are experiencing it right now, let me help — the answer is Toto). And when they experienced the phenomenon, they rated their willingness to gamble as significantly higher than when they had no inkling of the answer.</p>
<p>The authors replicated this finding in a second study of 180 participants, in which some people had a 10-second delay between indicating whether they had experienced the phenomenon and rating their willingness to gamble. These participants also showed a greater inclination to gamble after tip-of-the-tongue states, but the effect wasn’t as strong compared to those without the delay, suggesting that the bias was wearing off.</p>
<p>Finally, the team again repeated the study, this time asking participants to make an actual, rather than hypothetical, decision to gamble on a coin toss. The participants started with 100 points, winning 10 more after correctly guessing the outcome of the toss, and losing 10 when they were wrong. Again, participants were more willing to gamble after tip-of-the-tongue states compared to other instances where they couldn’t answer the question.</p>
<p>The study shows that fleeting positive feelings associated with tip-of-the-tongue states can spill over to affect other decisions. Interestingly, participants showed an <em>even greater</em> inclination to gamble when they were able to actually give answers to the questions. This suggests that tip-of-the-tongue experiences are best seen as “a partial form of retrieval success”, say the authors, “experienced as more positive than no success at all, but less positive than full-blown retrieval success.”</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether the results hold when looking at behaviour with real risks and benefits. The final experiment was meant to provide some real-world validity to the study, but still relied on participants betting on abstract points rather than actually gambling for money. It would also be interesting to know whether the “afterglow” from tip-of-the-tongue states influences other kinds of decisions beyond risk-taking. Still, it seems clear that transient positive-seeming experiences can affect our behaviour in ways that we might not realise.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Imagine taking a two-week holiday to the Bahamas. Sand, sea, and reef — who wouldn’t<i> love</i> it? I mean, personally, though I <i>would</i> love aspects of it, I’m quickly bored on a beach, I’m too nervous of deep water to dive and excessive sun brings me out in a rash. But that’s just me. Anyone else would just adore it….right? </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">This, it turns out, is a classic example of a bias, dubbed the overestimation bias, revealed in a <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-69146-001"><span style="color: black;">new paper</span></a></span><span class="None">, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>. In a series of studies involving thousands of participants, Minah Jung at New York University and colleagues found that we over-estimate how much other people will enjoy, pay for or wait for a desirable experience or object. The team thinks this is because while we can appreciate that a predominantly positive experience may have some downsides for us personally, we tend to assume that for somebody else, it will be more purely perfect.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span id="more-38896"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the first set of studies, the team explored how much participants were willing to pay for a movie ticket vs how much they thought someone else would pay for the same ticket; how much they — or how much they thought other people — would enjoy various products (including a return flight to Paris, a treadmill or a personal driver plus limousine for a month); and how long they or others would be willing to wait for a new product or experience, such as seeing the latest<i> Star Wars</i> movie. In each of these studies, the overestimation bias was clearly evident. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">A further study showed that this bias extends to unappealing things, too. The participants in this group reported that other people would pay more than they would to avoid a range of negative scenarios, including going without sleep that night and eating three large jalapeno peppers with nothing to drink. They also reported that others would find those experiences worse than they would themselves. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">This team suspects, therefore, that the overestimation bias happens because we believe that other people have less nuanced experiences — so more fully positive reactions to “good” things and more purely negative reactions to “bad” things — than we do ourselves. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">This idea was further supported by a study finding that when an event could only be seen as good, with no possible downsides — winning $500 — the overestimation bias vanished. Also, when a separate group of participants were prompted to appreciate that people do in fact have diverse preferences and valuations, the bias was significantly reduced. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“People are capable of understanding others’ preferences, but they do not spontaneously consider and integrate the entire distribution of possible preferences unless they are explicitly compelled to do so,” the researchers write. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The work has all kinds of implications. When buying gifts for others, for example, it would be sensible to bear in mind that if you think there could be downsides to receiving a particular “amazing” object (like an electronic massager, say), the intended recipient could well be less than 100 % enthusiastic about it, too. Also, if you do receive such an object and immediately go to sell it, the price you think someone else will be willing to pay for it could well be less than you hope. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">As the team writes: “In social judgements we are frequently called upon to make predictions about the evaluations of others, such as how much a friend will enjoy a recommended novel, how long a coworker will be willing to wait for useful feedback, or how much a potential buyer will be willing to offer for a used set of golf clubs. The overestimation bias has important implications [for] real world economic and social decisions.”</span></span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/615834256/0/oupblogpsychology/">The problem of consciousness</a></h4>

<p>Many people find consciousness deeply puzzling. It is often described as one of the few remaining problems for science to address that is genuinely deep—perhaps even unsolvable.</p><p>Indeed, consciousness is thought to present a challenge to the prevailing scientific image of the universe as physical through-and-through. In part this puzzlement arises because people are (at least tacitly, on an unconscious level) innate dualists—they consider there to be a division between the mental and physical, the mind and body—resulting from a deep disconnect between the core principles of our intuitive, common-sense, or so-called “folk” psychology and the structure of our intuitive (pre-scientific) physics.</p><p>This is why people the world over have always been open to belief in ghosts and spirits, as well as the possibility of an afterlife. It is hard for them to see how the mind could be comprised of arrangements and interactions of physical matter. But this problem—the problem of how mental states in general can be physical—has arguably been solved by cognitive science through some combination of functionalism and the representational theory of mind. That is, the mind is comprised of physical states that perform distinctive functional roles—such as motivating actions in the case of desires, or guiding them in the case of beliefs—while carrying information about (and representing) objects and properties in the world outside of the thinker.</p><p>Even cognitive scientists continue to find <em>consciousness</em> mysterious, however. But this is not the consciousness of being awake versus asleep, nor the sort of consciousness involved in being conscious of (that is, perceiving) some event in one’s environment. Neither of these is mysterious from the standpoint of cognitive science. What is thought to be puzzling is so-called <em>phenomenal </em>consciousness—the introspectively accessible felt properties of our experiences. The nature of this puzzlement is best captured through—and arguably depends on—philosophers’ thought experiments. (My view is that cognitive scientists wouldn’t take these thought experiments seriously were it not for their own tacit dualism about the mind; and non-scientists find the consciousness-debate so fascinating because it confirms their tacit dualism about the mind.) For it seems that I can imagine a creature for whom perceiving the greenness of grass feels introspectively to it in just the same way that seeing the redness of a rose feels to me. Indeed, it seems that I can imagine a creature exactly like myself in all respects (physical, functional, and representational) except that it lacks <em>this</em> (the way my current experience of red feels to me). Many think, in consequence, that phenomenal consciousness involves special properties—often called “qualia”—that aren’t explicable in physical terms.</p><p>In fact, however, there are no special properties. There are no qualia. The temptation to think otherwise derives from the special way in which we can think introspectively about our own perceptual states, deploying concepts such as <em>this</em> (feel of my experience of red). The “problem” of consciousness merely arises out of the contrast between first- and third-person modes of thinking about our own states. For it is one-and-the-same state, with one-and-the-same set of physical and functional properties, that can be thought of now as <em>a perception of red</em> and now as <em>this feel</em>. The latter is just a different way of thinking of the very same state as the former.</p><p>Given that there is no extra property that enters the world with phenomenal consciousness, it follows that the question of consciousness in non-human animals is of no scientific importance. There are many important questions that arise when comparing the minds of ourselves and other animals. We can ask about capacities for long-term planning in animals, for example, and we can ask to what extent their working-memory capacities resemble our own. But the question of qualia isn’t among those questions. For there are no qualia. There are just perceptual states that are available to be thought about (in humans) using a distinctive set of first-person concepts like <em>this feel</em>.</p><p>Some will say that although the question of animal consciousness might not matter for science, it surely matters for ethics. And indeed, as the continuities between human and animal minds have been increasingly recognized, so people have come to feel that it is urgent to identify the set of creatures that are capable of consciousness. This may be because consciousness is a prerequisite for <em>empathy</em>. One can’t enter imaginatively into the experience of another creature unless those experiences, like one’s own, are <em>like something</em> to undergo, it is thought. But empathy arguably is not, and shouldn’t be, foundational to ethical thinking. And the emotion of <em>sympathy</em>, in contrast, can be grounded in a third-person understanding of the desires and sufferings of the creature in question. Perhaps this may be all that is necessary for questions about the ethical treatment of animals to arise.</p><p>Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@anthonyintraversato?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Anthony Intraversato</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/the-problem-of-consciousness/">The problem of consciousness</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/615834256/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/615834256/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/how-well-do-you-know-anne-bronte/" rel="nofollow">How well do you know Anne Brontë?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bI3Fsti43lk/">Breaking down publication to share the full story of your research</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/01/OS-blog_January-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are traditional research articles still meeting researchers’ communication needs? Over the past decade, Open Science and the rise in digital publications together have facilitated a more agile ecosystem of research-sharing. For researchers, that means: faster pathways to sharing their discoveries; greater transparency of assessment which helps increase reliability and public trust; and more opportunities for collaborations that accelerate advancements in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With increased options for sharing and evaluating science, we’re looking at ways to segment the research-sharing lifecycle to fit the research process. How do we share important, urgent discoveries earlier, without compromising quality? What other essential products of research can we be more transparent about?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Sharing the full story of your research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of publishing might be incremental. Discovery occurs in stages, and the way we share and evaluate research should reflect that. Like <a href="https://plos.org/preregistration">preregistration</a>, a series of linked publications could help show the progression of research from the earliest stages of discovery to its final outcomes. More options for linked publications could also offer a format for presenting additional findings that may be tangential to the main study but spark important new lines of inquiry, allowing for more immediate, accurate, and complete scientific communication overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical research timeline could take years to develop a research plan, gather findings, analyze the data, and seek a suitable journal for publication. When it comes to pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, that seems like too long to wait. A segmented approach to research sharing would make information available faster. </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, give authors more control over when their work becomes public. Posting an early version of their work creates an opportunity for community assessment which sparks new collaborations and can ultimately help strengthen the work for publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more complete and diverse array of outputs to choose from would enable a more dynamic system of credit where researchers receive recognition for their participation in each stage of the process. Options for publishing data, code, protocols, and other products of scientific inquiry as distinct units could also provide incentives for researchers to share more of their work by offering proper credit.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining assessment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New outputs pave the way for a redefinition of assessment. Just as they provide a more honest rendering of the research process, assessment criteria can be tailored to each output, ultimately leading to a more robust system of evaluation that is more aligned with the aims of research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about preregistration </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/preregistration-can-bring-science-back-to-its-roots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier in this series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it’s worth mentioning again here how this model ties publication and assessment more closely to the process of scientific research. Preregistration allows for staged assessment that ultimately improves the investigation by making the study design more robust from the very beginning. It also sets different expectations for the final research outcomes, focusing peer review first on a strong methodological study design and later on adherence to the study protocol so that authors receive an outcome-neutral assessment that emphasizes scientific integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorter forms of publication might could prompt further investigation by sharing early findings and ongoing progress. Update articles offer authors the opportunity to continue a line of inquiry and report back any new findings which might change the way the initial study is perceived, or open avenues for a new line of inquiry, demonstrating more concretely that scientific discovery is not finite, but an ongoing progression of knowledge.</span></p>

A conservative think tank organises a research integrity conference to prove climate change is not real. It is a white men-only academic event, and there are good reasons for that.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Decisions-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>When it’s time for young adults to make that jump from pediatric to adult nephrologists, it can be daunting and nerve-racking.  Will it be the same?  Who is this new person?  Will they know my medical history?  Will we have to go through the same treatment strategies again?  What is everyone’s role?  Am I ready to take on my health care responsibility?  All of these questions are running through the mind of the patient and the parent.  As an adult nephrologist, my clinical workflow can be quite different from a pediatric nephrologist.  It can often be a daunting task for me when it comes to taking over the care of a pediatric patient who is making the adult service leap.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1665-7">study</a> by Joslin <em>et al., </em>published this week in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a>, discussed the focus that is placed on the clinical outcomes when evaluating these transition clinics, but what about psychosocial outcomes? The study evaluated young adult patient perspectives of their transition program using Likert questionnaires and interviews to address the readiness to transition, the transition process, and the perception of adult care.  The average age of transition was 20 years old and the majority were ready to transfer to the adult health care environment, often insisting they were ready earlier than their transition was planned.</p>
<blockquote><p>adolescents with renal disease are seen as a particularly vulnerable group</p></blockquote>
<p>However, adolescents with renal disease are seen as a particularly vulnerable group. There might be variability in maturity, cognitive delays, establishing their identity and feelings, body image development, personal values, and developing their adult roles. This adds to the list of service transition challenges for both young adults and nephrologists.</p>
<h3><strong>What are some of the other key challenges young adults and nephrologists face with transitions?</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Timing of transition</strong></h4>
<p>When should young adults make that leap to adult health care?  It may need to be individualized.  Every young adult is different.  The discussion should start during checkups or routine office visits between 12-14 years old. Ideally, young adults will start to transition to adult health care between the ages of 18 and 21 years.</p>

<h4><strong>Difficulty navigating adult health care system</strong></h4>
<p>Many differences between pediatric and adult nephrology clinics have been <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00467-004-1763-y.pdf">previously outlined</a>. In pediatric nephrology clinics, the visits are family-oriented and multidisciplinary teams/support is readily available. In contrast, adult nephrology clinics are typically focused on the individual, with limited multidisciplinary support and knowledge of rare ‘pediatric’ diseases. Young adults making the transition to adult health care environments have often been followed by their pediatric nephrologist since birth or childhood so they usually have an understanding of everyone’s roles in the pediatric nephrology clinic. But, once they make the transition to the adult environment a common complaint is knowing what the role of everyone is in this new health care system including their own role.</p>

<h4><strong>Parent-child relationships</strong></h4>
<p>Parents are key players in the health care of their children and valued as integral members of the health care team.  Once a young adult transitions to the adult health care system, parental involvement is transitioned to the sidelines. Are young adults (and parents) ready for that? Young adults might dismiss their ability to handle their health care needs and they do not have the experience to deal with managing treatment decisions, consenting to treatments, comprehending instructions, etc. The experiences of young adults and parents have <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/gfl770.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAm0wggJpBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJaMIICVgIBADCCAk8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMEYTj3XpFM1f3U2z7AgEQgIICIA9zTHpYXs3YRC_BwUZE76fLiRQ_vYzPLCXB9anXw9dN4XiW8-kzmuuFhvxx-DgQVXWLj-538YKa1RhlAWuWu-iKzRcY2muOuq8gYhHKwyNdJuNMKxo40jz8uLP0GUQa6zev17h-KTTafBZ4VyRnydcgMlPUyzNYZM6Cr_c-T-N5IvYtIZy__F0RUm673W7Kqcvi0oYb-GhQuuncH08nyHE2gjfoLMpqp-zs_CUnIlU-ItD-E_TR-6hjHx2ZLc7hG-KWK9p2YyosPGqSumjs0qM7VZmsW3-eMpNj-qqjBVyF0zPYNsUciVad2Y7HgMDA1I9FvK3Y_ORsG9vyo-Cft7JqZLAWFoT-_2QEJPipWjLop1kHaV7eq7Ya85zBoM0vjYgLYtJox_2qUsWVYLNoJ6TmmlC6R6nKSn3ourz40f_0mwkTqTDyOpgYB1ipgcX5UF2gqTVY1SZkeu2XX5IjKD7kWkeHJxXEPl6gIrZicmb5Yl6kFwNNrjpsmeu-R902w6rQeMT5bqa2no_zqsJyJ8RuNb3u7-pWQee9CDU87Gwr5FwUb52I2wj0abQoxzE8W20XI5onRVaKAgzYtMUDQ9stIz4Kx7igwBeugnRLOrNUjYex4gbdinBo6IPevLd-C2JR--bvZ5RPao0vk-kd8Lex3zEeKHeFt2HdN49ub5XPQV-g5oBRZLYdgbRcXBp27JwHFTusVMWo7HaBEBwod78">previously been described</a> in the literature.</p>

<h3><strong>What are the strategies young adult patients and nephrologist can implement to mentally prepare for the healthcare transition?</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theisn.org/">International Society of Nephrology</a> and the <a href="https://ipna-online.org/">International Pediatric Nephrology Association</a> provide a <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00467-011-1981-z.pdf">consensus statement</a> outlining the ideal clinical management of young adult patients transitioning from pediatric to adult renal services.  By implementing a transition program, you can create a more fluid process for transitioning young adults.  A few key recommendations from the consensus statement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning a young adult patient should be individualized and agreed upon by the patient and the parents in conjunction with the pediatric and adult health care teams.</li>
<li>A transition champion in the pediatric and adult health care units should be identified to help coordinate and educate on the transition.</li>
<li>The young adult should be able to receive tools to aid in developing self-management skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot can be gained from studies aiming to understand how best to transition young adults from pediatric to adult services. What’s clear from the work of Joslin <em>et al. </em>is that we should also focus our evaluation of these transition clinics not only on the clinical outcomes but the psychosocial outcomes of the young adults making the adult service leap.</p>

<p>The excesses of Christmas have been and gone, and we’ve been met once again by January’s familiar call for resolution and goal-setting.</p>
<p>For most of us, New Year’s resolutions are a mixed bag: whether we’re looking to get fit, become more environmentally-friendly, or just keep up a new hobby, there sometimes seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why some habits stick and others fall by the wayside almost immediately.</p>
<p>But there are a few things you can do to make your new routines work, based on research into motivation, temptation and achievement. Here’s our digest of the ten findings that could help make that New Year’s resolution stay around until next December.<span id="more-38880"></span></p>
<p><strong>Plan for moments of temptation, don’t just respond to them</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to give something up, even for a short period of time, you’ll know just how all-consuming temptation can be. Skipping a session at the gym, letting your screen time creep back up, or flaking on plans when you promised you wouldn’t: it can sometimes feel almost impossible not to cave.</p>
<p>And whilst we often put our ability to ignore these temptations down to our capacity to exercise self-control in the moment, actively <em>planning</em> for temptation may be better than just responding to it, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219883606">as one 2019 study argued</a>. Another, also published in 2019<u>,</u> found that more “planful” people were <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/24/your-level-of-planfulness-could-determine-how-often-you-visit-the-gym/">more likely to keep up their gym habit</a>.</p>
<p>Goal progress was far better supported by <em>proactive</em> rather than <em>reactive</em> strategies of self-control, the first study found — so planning how you’re going to deal with urges before they arise may be a better way of keeping new habits up than hoping for the best when temptation strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Find a sense of purpose</strong></p>
<p>Having a sense of purpose can be of huge psychological benefit: you’re likely to have  greater emotional well-being and to feel generally better about life, for instance.</p>
<p>And some research suggests it may make you better off financially, too. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656616300836?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">2016 study</a> followed more than 7000 participants over nine years, finding that those with a “greater sense of purpose” had <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/31/find-a-sense-of-purpose-and-youre-more-likely-to-get-rich/">also ended up richer</a> than those with little or none.</p>
<p>Of course there are structural issues at play — those on low salaries or living with debt are extremely unlikely to have got there merely because they didn’t have a sense of purpose, nor will they be able to suddenly become millionaires if one develops.</p>
<p>But still, the findings suggest that having a greater sense of purpose in life could be a useful strategy for working towards long-term goals.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t get too confident</strong></p>
<p>In more research related to temptation, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/12/10/step-away-from-the-cookie-jar-over-confidence-in-self-control-leads-us-to-temptation/">this 2009 study</a> looked at the “cold to hot empathy gap”: the idea that when we’re sated in some way, we vastly overestimate our ability to resist temptation.</p>
<p>When we’re feeling fine, we might not feel the need to chuck that half-full packet of cigarettes, for example — we’re definitely not going to smoke them, so there’s no point throwing them away. When we’re experiencing cravings or are hungry or tired, however, we don’t feel quite so confident in our ability to resist, and are less likely to do so.</p>
<p>In other words, inflated confidence in our own self-control could be our downfall when it comes to giving up bad habits.</p>
<p><strong>Find an accountability partner</strong></p>
<p>There’s a reason people go to the gym together, and it’s not just down to sociability: having someone to be accountable to makes you far more likely to stick at a goal.</p>
<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804317300861">researchers asked participants to log when they visited the gym</a>, with the promise that they would be entered into a lottery if they met their goals. Some participants, either enrolled alone or in a pair, were unable to see when fellow participants were visiting the gym. Another two groups, again alone or in a pair, were able to see the frequency of their peers’ visits. Those in teams — whether or not they could see visit frequency — were <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/16/find-a-gym-buddy-not-letting-them-down-may-be-the-most-powerful-incentive-to-get-exercising/">far more likely to exercise</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So if you think you might be likely to waver, team up with someone else. It’s not foolproof, but it might help.</p>
<p><strong>Use the right metaphors</strong></p>
<p>You may baulk at the idea that your attempts to achieve goals constitute a “journey” — overuse of the term can make it sound facile and corny at best. But using the metaphor, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-34220-001">one study found</a>, was more helpful than you might expect.</p>
<p>Nearly 2000 participants were asked to think of recently achieved goals in one of three ways: with no metaphor involved, as “completing a journey”, or as “reaching a destination”. And those in the “journey” cohort were <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/16/metaphors-matter-seeing-our-achievements-as-completing-a-journey-helps-maintain-success/">far more likely to continue goal-related behaviours</a>, and more likely to act on them, too (not dropping fitness regimes, for example).</p>
<p>So whilst you might feel like an X-Factor contestant when you talk about your “journey”, it might just be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Let yourself lapse</strong></p>
<p>It feels awful when you break a new habit — and can lead to giving up entirely. But planning lapses may actually help you achieve goals in the long term.</p>
<p>Following a strict regime, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jcps.2015.05.001">one paper argues</a>, can make people feel like a total failure when they’re unable to keep it up 24/7. This, in turn, affects motivation, and in the end you’re less likely to sustain your new habit at all.</p>
<p>But planning lapses can actually help — you’re less likely to lose motivation, more likely to find new routines fun rather than a chore, and more likely to keep up levels of self-control the rest of the time. It might feel counter-intuitive, but letting yourself go every once in a while could be the best way to maintain new habits.</p>
<p><strong>Distract yourself</strong></p>
<p>Working on your willpower is all well and good — but in the moment, sometimes you just need a distraction. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0032198">Classic studies</a> found that children with “distraction strategies” — singing, for example — were better able to resist sweets and chocolate, and that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0399">chimpanzees find success</a> with much the same strategy.</p>
<p>Research from 2016 also found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/16/busy-people-are-especially-good-at-bouncing-back-from-missed-deadlines/">busy people were more likely to bounce back from missed deadlines</a> — not quite analogous, but perhaps a suggestion that distraction techniques may help us cope with demoralising, demotivating experiences.</p>
<p>It might not be the most sophisticated tactic — and covering your eyes, as many of the children did in Mischel’s 1972 study, is unlikely to stop you from having a sneaky cigarette on your lunch break. But filling your time with distracting activities may be a good tool in your arsenal when it comes to breaking bad habits.</p>
<p><strong>Practise acts of self-control </strong></p>
<p>Squeezing a handgrip every day doesn’t seem like it would do much for achieving your goals — aside from being distracting, of course. But it requires substantial effort to continue squeezing after your muscles get tired, and researchers have suggested that practising this kind of effortful task may help people develop their self-control more generally.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-21970-001">study of Swiss students</a>, using a handgrip for two weeks <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/01/practising-self-control-with-a-squeezy-handgrip-boosted-these-students-grades">led to both significant increases in their own school performance</a>, and significantly higher levels of achievement than participants in the non-squeezing condition. The researchers suggest the physical self-control exercise led participants to feel more willing to make an effort to study.</p>
<p>Similar results were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20853930">found in a study looking at smoking cessation</a>: so whilst engaging in tiny acts of self-control may not seem like much, they could help you on a grander scale, too.</p>
<p><strong>Develop further passion</strong><strong>        </strong></p>
<p>And if you haven’t set a New Year’s resolution yet, here’s a suggestion: resolve to develop a new passion. Many of us have a passion in life, and many of us experience great pleasure because of it; pursuing something you love, whether through work or at home, can bring great emotional fulfilment.</p>
<p>But broadening your horizons a bit — being polyamorous about passion, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10902-014-9564-x">as a 2015 paper put it</a> — can also have multiple benefits. It found that participants with two passions had greater well-being, enhanced happiness and more positive moods — even when time invested in both passions was the same as the time invested in one.</p>
<p>So if there’s a hobby you’ve always wanted to take up, now’s the time.</p>
<p><strong>Give yourself a break</strong></p>
<p>All this talk of temptation, willpower and self-control can feel exhausting. So don’t forget to give yourself some time off.</p>
<p>Allowing yourself to sit in front of the TV slobbing out, research suggests, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/16/forgive-yourself-for-relaxing-in-front-of-the-tv-and-the-couch-time-might-actually-do-you-some-good/">can have multiple benefits</a>. Recategorising such behaviour — thinking of it as relaxation, rather than procrastination — can make you feel less guilty about binge watching or video game playing, and more likely to reap the benefits of relaxation. More <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/05/04/the-cure-for-procrastination-forgive-yourself/">research from 2010</a> backs this up: forgiving yourself for procrastination can make you feel far less guilty and, in the end, far more likely to fulfil your goals.</p>
<p>In other words? Cut yourself some slack.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/image-3-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>If you and your community were impacted by a serious health condition, would you want to have a say in local and national research priorities?</p>
<p>“Nothing About Us Without Us!” is a slogan that has become a rallying cry for community partnership in all public services and policy setting. For our team at <a href="https://pretermbirthca.ucsf.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UCSF California Preterm Birth Initiative</a> (PTBi-CA), the saying could easily describe what we consider to be the best approach to research for improving birth outcomes in the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>The preterm birth epidemic</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11572" height="113" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/PTBi-Logo-Full-Dark-grey-Orange-01-300x113.png" width="300" /></strong></p>
<p>Preterm birth has persisted at epidemic levels in our country for decades and disproportionately affects women of color. Black women give birth preterm at almost a <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/MOD2019_REPORT_CARD_and_POLICY_ACTIONS_BOOKLETv72.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50 percent higher rate</a> than all other women in the U.S., regardless of both education and socioeconomic levels. At PTBi-CA, we see mounting evidence that stress, related to structural and interpersonal racism, and other social determinants of health are major drivers of poor birth outcomes in Black families.</p>
<p>However, women of color have not been included in setting preterm birth research agendas. Studies continue to use traditional approaches that give privilege to small groups with decision-making power, without direct input from those with lived experience. Furthermore, research is one of the last domains of the healthcare enterprise that lacks patient and public involvement at every level.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is growing international consensus that research must be conducted in partnership <em>with</em> patients and communities, and not <em>on</em> or <em>for</em> them. This approach can improve recruitment and retention, provides greater relevance and credibility, and accelerates translation of results into clinical practice. Our current work to elicit and prioritize potential research questions and topics with women of color is a step towards full research partnership.</p>
<h3><strong>Dismantling the hierarchy and fighting historical abuses</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>To establish trust, we invested in the community’s existing infrastructure and capacity-building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Typical methods of involving patients and the public in research include gathering input from patient advocacy organizations, inviting patients or their representatives to stakeholder consultation meetings, or conducting surveys. However, these approaches typically begin with a review of existing scientific literature to identify gaps in knowledge. This may inadvertently lead to traditional medical-establishment priorities overshadowing those of people directly affected by the condition.</p>
<p>To develop a new pregnancy and newborn care research strategy, we at PTBi-CA sought a deeper, more authentic partnership approach by using the <a href="https://pretermbirthca.ucsf.edu/news/new-protocol-research-priority-setting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research Priorities of Affected Communities (RPAC) protocol.</a> The protocol is based on the Research Justice Framework, where experiential knowledge as well as cultural and spiritual knowledge have equal value with “mainstream” knowledge.</p>
<p>Before we could begin the work, we partnered with seven community-based organizations (CBOs) that serve pregnant persons of color in areas that have high preterm birth rates. Establishing trust with our CBO partners was a priority and proved challenging due to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/25/556673640/scientists-work-to-overcome-legacy-of-tuskegee-study-henrietta-lacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historical abuses</a> of Black and other minority communities in medical research. To establish trust, we invested in the community’s existing infrastructure and capacity-building. For example, we compensated CBO partners for hosting focus groups, for co-facilitating and for personally inviting clients who met the inclusion criteria. We offered participants opportunities for further engagement with future research and held community events to educate and raise awareness.</p>
<p>The application of the Research Justice framework and the RPAC method led to great results, reported in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2664-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>. Fifty-four women generated a total of 375 potentially researchable questions, clustered within 22 topics. The questions represent a wide range of domains, from basic science, translational, clinical, health and social care delivery to policy and economic research. The findings directly contributed to our initiative’s research strategy and our partnership with community would not stop there.</p>
<h3><strong>Community evolves the research funding process</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“I’m feeling really good at the fact that we are involved, hopefully, in the next generation of healthy babies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We invited our study participants, and those from other community partnerships, to join a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to continually advise us. Each year, CAB members are invited to participate in the grant review process to fund projects that are in line with the community research prioritization questions. In addition to participating in grant-review and funding decisions, the CAB helped to revise the grant application process to include plain English summaries and to greater emphasize community partnership and research dissemination.</p>
<p>The CAB regularly interacts with investigators to increase community partnership literacy among researchers and research literacy among community members. Some of our grantees have gone on to include community partnership in other studies not funded by PTBi-CA. Also, several of the CAB members or community research partners have since transitioned to employment within our organization in a variety of research roles.</p>
<p>None of this progress would be possible without our community partners’ willingness, support and expertise. Our hope is that more research organizations will adopt a research justice framework in their work to help heal the wounds created by past research abuses and to accelerate a fully community-partnered research agenda, leading to positive change and better outcomes for all. As Davina Countee, a community member and study participant, commented about our approach: “I’m feeling really good at the fact that we are involved, hopefully, in the next generation of healthy babies.”</p>

<p><strong>Music can make us feel a range of emotions — but are those experiences common to everyone, or specific to our own cultural groups?</strong> A new study has identified “13 distinct and very specific feelings”, such as feelings of triumph or awe, that were shared by both Chinese and American participants when listening to music, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-a-sad-song-sad-for-everyone/">reports David Noonan</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. This suggests that at least some of our music-induced emotional experiences are universal.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/cover-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Expectant parents do not anticipate birth and death to collide. However, for <a href="https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/maternal_perinatal/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of families</a> worldwide each year, the death of their baby due to miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death within the first 28 days of life, is a devastating reality.</p>
<p>Historically, parents’ grief over these losses remained <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/OM.63.2.e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unacknowledged</a>. Over the past few decades, research into the emotional burden of grief has resulted in the development of <a href="https://www.stillbirthcre.org.au/assets/Uploads/Section-3-Full-bereavement-care-guideline2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sensitive healthcare</a> and <a href="http://www.stillbirthfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stillbirth-systematic-review-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">psychosocial support</a> for families. However, bereaved parents continue to report <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519218317220?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stigma </a>and societal norms which can minimize their loss.</p>
<h3><strong>Men and baby loss</strong></h3>
<p>Men are <a href="https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(16)30315-1/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly involved</a> in pregnancy and childbirth. Nevertheless, what we know about men’s grief when a baby dies before or shortly after birth remains somewhat limited. Most previous research and subsequent bereavement care guidelines focus on the experiences of heterosexual women, despite men reporting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2004.00393.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feeling overlooked</a> or ‘<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1440783311413485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forgotten</a>’ as grieving fathers. As one father in <a href="https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(18)30343-7/abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our earlier research</a> described:</p>
<p><em>“Every time I’d get a text from my friends the text was like how’s [female partner]? […] but you know, the father is just as upset even though he doesn’t necessarily show it in the same way”</em> (John, father to stillborn baby)</p>
<p>Therefore, to develop a more-comprehensive understanding of men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss, <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2677-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our recent systematic review</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, summarized existing research on how men experience grief and the factors which contribute to men’s grief.</p>
<h3><strong>‘It’s complicated’</strong></h3>
<p>Our searches identified 46 relevant studies. Grief was highly individual, however, men do seem to face specific challenges which may complicate or delay their grief, and differ from the experiences of women.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need wider strategies and policies that recognise men as grieving fathers.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, there was a general trend towards more problem-focused coping strategies such as ‘keeping busy’ or using distractions including activities or work. Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness were also common, along with responsibilities to care for other children, complete paperwork, organize a funeral/burial, and inform family and friends of the loss. Importantly, a tension also existed between expressing their grief and holding it in or “being strong” to support their female partner and family.</p>
<p>In studies comparing men and women, men generally scored lower on grief measures than women. Importantly, however, the way we currently measure grief may not capture the complexities of men’s grief. Several studies highlighted that commonly used measures may not be sensitive to differences in styles of grief that men may exhibit (e.g., ‘doing’ versus ‘feeling’).</p>
<h3><strong>Four levels</strong></h3>
<p>The factors affecting grief varied across studies. Broadly, we grouped these factors into four different levels: individual, interpersonal, community, and public policy.</p>
<p>At the individual level, factors included men’s personality, their demographic background, and their attachment to the unborn or newborn baby. In general, men who had developed a strong bond with their baby experienced more intense grief.</p>
<p>At the interpersonal level, support and acknowledgement from family, friends, and healthcare professionals were critical in determining how well men could express and navigate their grief. A lack of recognition or support led to feelings of isolation which worsened grief.</p>
<p>At the community level, cultural norms relating to grief and masculinity ideals often led men to feel as though they needed to be the “strong one” or “supporter” to their female partner, rather than a grieving father. This role often took precedence over men’s own needs.</p>
<p>Finally, policies relating to bereavement leave in the workplace, and the woman-centered nature of pregnancy and maternity care, had the potential to contribute to a sense of isolation for men. Three studies identified that a lack of bereavement leave options for men impacted upon how well they were able to work through their grief, and in seven studies, a focus solely on women’s health, especially in the hospital environment, left many men feeling removed and unsupported.</p>
<h3><strong>A broader concept of grief</strong></h3>
<p>Given this range of factors that appear to affect grief, we have proposed a socio-ecological model of men’s grief, which recognizes that grief does not exist in isolation. Rather, it is shaped by a complex system of interacting factors and levels. Without strategies to address factors at each level, we risk increasing men’s isolation and decreasing both perceived and real access to support.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11567" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11567 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Model-300x200.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">from: Obst, et al. 2020</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>While individual grief counselling and support groups are important, we also need wider strategies and policies that recognise men as grieving fathers. Suggestions include hospital programs that genuinely engage with fathers and promote an equal partnership throughout pregnancy and childbirth; campaigns to raise awareness of the impact of pregnancy/neonatal loss on families, including men; and evaluating current workplace policies for bereavement leave, to afford men equal opportunity to mourn their loss and access appropriate psychosocial supports.</p>

<p>Kidney Week began with 10 early programs, followed by an Annual Meeting that was packed with plenary talks, clinical sessions, educational symposia, and poster sessions. Organized around the sessions were meetings with <em>BMC Nephrology</em> <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Editorial Board Members</a> who kindly agreed to meet with me.</p>
<p>Each day started with a series of state-of-the-art lectures including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/jennifer-doudna">Prof. Jennifer Doudna</a>, <em>University of California, Berkeley</em>,  on <strong>“Rewriting the code of life: the future of genome editing”</strong></li>
<li>Nobel Prize Laureate <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/914-michael-w-young/">Prof. Michael Young</a>, <em>Rockefeller University</em>, on <strong>“Genes controlling sleep and circadian rhythms”</strong></li>
<li><em>Segway</em><img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> inventor Dean Kamen (<em>DEKA Research &amp; Development Corp.</em>) and nephrologists <a href="https://payorsolutions.cvshealth.com/contributors/bruce-culleton-md">Dr. Bruce Culleton</a> (<em>CVS Health</em>), and <a href="https://www.asn-online.org/about/staff.aspx">Dr. Tod Ibrahim</a> (<em>American Society of Nephrology</em>) on <strong>“Perspectives on innovation and transformation in kidney care”</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/danielle-ofri">Dr. Danielle Ofri</a>, <em>NYU School of Medicine</em>, on <strong>“What patients say, what doctors hear”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The daily programs were crammed with cutting-edge research covering all areas of nephrology and its crossovers with other areas of medicine. Here are some of my highlights.</p>
<h3><strong>State-of-the-art lecture: Innovation and Transformation in Kidney Care</strong></h3>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11555" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Dr. Tod Ibrahim speaking at the plenary session" class="size-medium wp-image-11555" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Tod-Ibrahim_Plenary.jpg_large-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Dr. Tod Ibrahim speaking at the plenary session.<br />Image Source: ASN Advocacy</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<blockquote><p><em>“Seventy-six years later, we carry a more powerful computer in our pocket, yet mostly rely on the same technology to treat kidney failure in in-center dialysis”</em> – <strong>Tod Ibrahim</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A highlight was the state-of-the-art lecture from inventor Dean Kamen and nephrologists Dr. Bruce Culleton and Dr. Tod Ibrahim, who contextualized the issue of poor health outcomes experienced globally by more than 850 million renal patients; racial inequalities in access to home dialysis; and the discard of usable kidney allografts while patients are dying on transplant waiting lists. Progress to resolve these issues in the field seems to have stalled, with Ibrahim naming underfunding from the government and investors as a contributor.</p>
<p>However, the overall feeling was optimistic. The speakers were enthusiastic about how technology could revolutionize future nephrology care, and how initiatives such as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/07/10/hhs-launches-president-trump-advancing-american-kidney-health-initiative.html">Advancing American Kidney Health</a> could help bring investment into future technologies. Furthermore, the setup of the US <a href="https://www.armiusa.org/">Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute</a> has brought the development of a system to induce pluripotent stem cells to generate segments of bone and ligament within 40 days. This begs the question: how can this area of developmental biology influence the manufacture of kidneys and other organs for transplantation?</p>

<p>I attended <em>BMC Nephrology</em> Section Editor, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Dr. Giorgina Piccoli</a>‘s (University of Torino, Italy) talk on <strong><em>‘Reproductive health in women with chronic kidney disease and kidney transplantation’</em></strong>. The risks that women experiencing kidney disease face are worrying, with patients on dialysis and with chronic kidney disease at higher risk of experiencing pre-eclampsia and premature parturition, amongst other risks, compared to the rest of the population. However, it was encouraging and inspiring to hear how Dr. Piccoli approaches these kinds of scenarios and how she values contraception and sexual health counseling and open communication with her female patients, to understand her patient’s wants and needs. <a href="https://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?t=11&amp;m=81&amp;page=528">Dr. Michelle Hladunewich</a>, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Canada, offered a positive outlook for the future for women on dialysis who hoped for a successful pregnancy. Dr. Hladunewich explained that when a patient falls pregnant whilst being treated with dialysis, the risk of premature delivery can be lowered with certain interventions such as careful attention to clearance rates and induction of labor. With Canada being one of the world’s leaders in live birth rates for women on hemodialysis, perhaps there are some important lessons to be learned here?</p>

<p>Increasing efforts have been made in recent years to encourage students to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. There’s been a particularly positive emphasis on getting a more diverse group of people onto such courses: women, black and ethnic minority groups and working class people have all been the focus of drives and campaigns designed to help them enter STEM careers.</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619882032">a new study</a> suggests, the competitive nature of STEM courses may be having a knock-on effect on the confidence of certain students, in this case first-generation college attendees (those who are the first in their family to go to university). Such students, the paper argues, are more likely to experience “imposter syndrome” — the feeling that they don’t belong or don’t have the skills or intelligence to continue on their studies — precisely because of this atmosphere of competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-38854"></span></p>
<p>In such environments, previous research has shown, students are more likely to compare themselves (often unfavourably) to others. When we feel our peers are our adversaries, rather than colleagues or comrades, we look to their successes and failures to judge ourselves: often, we believe we fall short, and our confidence falters.</p>
<p>In first-generation students, the paper argues, this can be even more damaging. First-generation students are often raised with communal values, relying on other people rather than seeing them as rivals. When this meets the competitive, individualistic world of STEM courses, it can have a particularly detrimental impact.</p>
<p>To study the impact of competition on first-generation college attendees, researchers enlisted 818 freshmen and sophomores enrolled in STEM courses at a large U.S. university. Participants were first asked to complete a survey, once at the beginning of term and once after the deadline to drop courses, measuring perceptions of classroom competition; participants rated statements such as “the professor seems to pit students against each other in a competitive manner in this class” on a scale of one to seven. Demographic data was also collected during these surveys, including information on whether participants were first-generation students.</p>
<p>Six weeks into term, students were sent further surveys to complete daily, asking whether or not they had been attending class. Those who had been attending were asked to explore imposter feelings, rating statements like “in class, I feel like people might find out I am not as capable as they think I am” on a scale of one to six; those who had not been attending were asked to explain why. The team also recorded how engaged students felt, how often they attended class, how much they thought about dropping out, and their grades.</p>
<p>As anticipated, those who felt classes were competitive were far more likely to feel as if they were an imposter, unable to keep up with the demands of their course. And compared to those with family members who had gone to university, first-generation students were more likely to experience feelings of imposter syndrome on a daily basis — but only in classes perceived to have high levels of competition. In non-competitive environments, imposter feelings were equal in both first-generation and continued generation students, suggesting that the atmosphere of the classroom really is a key driver.</p>
<p>By increasing their imposter feelings, the students’ perceptions of classroom competition also had a negative impact on their achievement, reducing engagement, attendance, and performance, and increasing dropout intentions. This effect was much greater amongst first-generation students</p>
<p>The team do note that repeatedly seeing questions about imposter syndrome may in fact have triggered those feelings: although measures were limited to once per day in the second part of the study, contemplating competition and achievement may in fact have enhanced feelings of insecurity or inadequacy.</p>
<p>How other identities intersect with the phenomenon was also left unaddressed. Women and people of colour are both more susceptible to imposter syndrome, for example, and exploring how such identities interact with one another could be a focus of future research.</p>
<p>Creating a welcoming, supportive environment for everybody to study STEM subjects, no matter their background, is key to a diverse and inclusive field. Understanding more about how students of different backgrounds experience STEM studies and actively developing strategies to counter inequalities are both vital steps towards making sure this happens.</p>

<p>The general public has a pretty poor understanding of how memory works — and lawyers and clinical psychologists can be just as bad. At least, this is what many researchers have asserted, notes a team at University College London in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-22927-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>. However, their research reveals that the idea that most people ignorantly subscribe to “memory myths” is itself a myth.</p>
<p>The wording of earlier studies, and also discrepancies in how memory experts and the general public tend to interpret the meaning of statements about memory, have painted a bleaker picture of public understanding than is actually the case, according to a series of studies led by Chris Brewin. This has important implications for cases in which ideas about memory are highly relevant — among jurors in a court room, for example.</p>
<p><span id="more-38849"></span>The researchers first explored one of the “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-17191-000">50 great myths of popular psychology</a>”: that memory is like a video camera.</p>
<p>The strongest support for this “great myth” comes from a 2011 nationally representative phone survey in the US, in which 24% of those surveyed “strongly agreed” and 39% “mostly agreed” with the statement (the precise wording is important): “Human memory works like a video camera, accurately recording the events we see and hear so that we can review and inspect them later.” Memory experts all disagreed. The case against the public, it seemed, was closed.</p>
<p>But this study only asked about the video camera analogy and didn’t ask whether they thought it was ‘like’ anything else. And perhaps, Brewin and his team wondered, experts and lay people might make different assumptions about what it implies, with experts taking the video camera analogy to mean that <em>everything </em>we see and hear is faithfully and fully recorded, whereas the participants might have thought that our memories store some scenes and interactions accurately, quite (if not entirely) like a video camera.</p>
<p>Their study of 172 young people from 27 different countries found that the video camera analogy was highly endorsed, but so too were statements likening memory to a “library”, a “diary entry”, and “rooms in a house”. And when the video camera analogy was explicitly linked to the assumption that events could be played back <em>exactly</em> (my italics) as they happened, more than 70 percent <em>disagreed</em> with it.</p>
<p>A subsequent study of 200 US adults found that people did report experiencing certain memories as a series of scenes “like a videotape”. These included memories of a son’s first birthday, for example, but also of everyday events like conversations with friends. This subjective experience was an important reason why two thirds of this sample endorsed the statement that memory was “partly” like a video camera.</p>
<p>The vast majority also agreed that all kinds of factors can affect a memory’s accuracy, and that some memories turn out to be mistaken. In fact, they were more likely to agree with the idea that memories are often mistaken, and have the potential to completely decay, than with statements asserting that they are highly accurate, or permanent. “In particular, statements consistent with scientific consensus that memory is neither complete (94%) nor passive (93%) were endorsed with very little disagreement,” the team reports.</p>
<p>A further study found that most lay people agreed with something that has been considered a myth, but which recent evidence has supported: that, under certain circumstances, the more confidence an eyewitness reports in a memory, the more accurate it is.</p>
<p>This groups’ attitudes to “repressed memories” was also explored. In contract to experimental psychologists, lay people and some clinical psychologists have tended to endorse the idea that traumatic memories can be repressed for many years and then recovered. This is often put forward as another example of belief in a memory myth.</p>
<p>But Brewin and his team found that, again, differences in interpretation of the terminology, rather than differences in ideas, seemed to underpin the discrepancy. The lay participants and professional psychologists tended to think of deliberate, rather than unconscious, “repression” of traumatic events. And while the idea that memories can be unconsciously repressed is certainly controversial, deliberate burying of upsetting memories is not.</p>
<p>Clearly, this new research doesn’t imply that the general public has a perfect understanding of memory. “Nevertheless, the findings suggest that non-expert opinions about memory may be more closely aligned with the evidence than has hitherto been appreciated,” the team writes.</p>
<p>This is important for legal and clinical contexts, they add. For example, earlier video camera results shouldn’t be taken to indicate that jurors don’t understand how memory works — or that testimony from experts about how memory works is essential in a trial.</p>

<p>Scallops are a family of bivalves. These modest saltwater clams often end up on seafood dinner plates, but did you know that scallops have dozens of image-forming eyes? They focus light onto a multi-layered retina through a telescope-like parabolic mirror. Their super-sensitive visual system, which contains multiple types of opsins typical of both invertebrates and vertebrates, allows them to detect predators from afar and swim away to safety. No wonder they have survived and thrived for hundreds of millions of years! Follow me in this journey through one of the most interesting visual systems in the animal kingdom.</p>



<h2>The eyes</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Scallop_eyes2.jpg" /><em>Macro photo of a scallop’s eyes. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop#/media/File:Scallop_eyes2.jpg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></figure></div>



<p>Scallops have up to 200 individual eyes about 1 mm across arranged along the edge of their mantle. When scallops grow, new eyes sprout in locations where there are fewer eyes. These eyes can regenerate within about 40 days when damaged, recapitulating their initial growth.</p>



<p>The eyes have an unusual optical path compared to most vertebrates and invertebrates, using reflection as the primary focusing mechanism. The light goes through a cornea and a lens, as in humans, but is then reflected by a mirror-like layer in the back of the eye. </p>

<p>Guanine crystals carefully aligned in the back of the eye act as a photonic material, reflecting light maximally around 500 nm wavelength. This layer of crystals is curved like a parabolic mirror, focusing light primarily on a double-layered retina located about three quarters of the way into the eye.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img alt="" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/358/6367/1172/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" /><em>Guanine crystals form a set of reflective square tiles in the back of the eyes.

<p>This is functionally similar to a telescope with a parabolic mirror, with a few twists. One twist is that the lens and the mirror are slightly tilted with respect to one another, which means that the image is in focus at different distances depending on the position within the retina, giving the eye multiple focal lengths. A second twist is that scallop eyes have pupils that can contract by up to 50%, decreasing their sensitivity but increasing their spatial resolution. Overall, these eyes give scallop eyes a spatial resolution of roughly 2 degrees, enviable compared to, say, the common mouse. </p>

(2011)</a>.</em></figure></div>



<p>Scallop eyes have two retinas, the proximal and the distal retina, at different distances from the mirror at the back of the eye. These retinas have led to one of the most fundamental rethinking of the evolution of opsins (light-sensing proteins) and vision. The textbook story used to go that: </p>



<ul><li>vertebrates have c-opsins, their photoreceptors are shaped like cilia, and they hyperpolarize when they receive light (they are OFF-cells). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/334348a0">The sensitivity of these photoreceptors is limited by thermal noise, or dark current</a>.</li><li>inverteberates have r-opsins, their photoreceptors are shaped like rhabdomeres, and they depolarize when they receive light (they are ON-cells). <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1982.sp014398">These photoreceptors have extremely high gain and act as single photon detectors</a>; however, they consume more energy than vertebrate receptors.</li></ul>



<p>From this observation it was easy to conclude that eyes evolved independently in vertebrates and invertebrates. An early crack in this tidy story of vertebrate vs. invertebrate eyes was the discovery of two different layers in the scallop retina. The proximal retina shows ON-responses (depolarizes) while the distal retina has OFF-responses (hyperpolarizes in response to light). It’s like there’s two different evolutionary pathways (vertebrate and invertebrate) in the same eye! </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7235" data-attachment-id="7235" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/image-1.png?w=748" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/image-1.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/image-1.png" data-orig-size="1832,896" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-1/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/image-1.png?w=1024" /><em>Prototypical vertebrate and invertebrate signal transduction pathways. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5795/1914">From Fernald et al.

<p>Functionally, the two types of layers seem to have highly complementary roles. The images on the distal retina are in much better focus than the ones in the proximal retina, with linear resolution better by a factor 10. They form the basis for shape vision in scallops. On the other hand, the proximal retina with its invertebrate-like ON-cells is much more sensitive to light, by a factor of 100X. It could underlie vision at night or in very turbulent water.</p>

<p>In the early 2000’s, the evidence vertebrates and invertebrates use both types of opsins started accumulating. In fact, we now know many examples of r-opsins in vertebrates and c-opsins in invertebrates. The most famous example, perhaps, is melanopsin, the r-opsin in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which regulate sleep and other circadian rhythms in mammals. We now think that r- and c-opsins evolved in the common ancestor of vertebrates, molluscs, arthropods and many other invertebrate families: the urbilateria. This is the posited great ancestor of multicellular animals with bilateral symmetry, the first example of which unambigously appeared in the fossil record 555 million years ago. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Figure 2" src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41559-017-0120/MediaObjects/41559_2017_Article_BFs415590170120_Fig2_HTML.jpg" /><em>Alignment of genomes of different species and presumed ancestral linkage groups. Scallop (top left) has best alignment. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0120">From Wang et al. (2017).</a></em></figure>



<p>What did urbilateria look like? Recent evidence shows that urbilateria may have looked like… modern scallops! A recent genetic analysis in Wang et al. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0120">2017</a>) revealed a striking correspondence between scallop genome and reconstructed ancestral linkage groups. This suggests that ancient bilaterians have a similar karyotype to modern scallops. The opsins carried in all vertebrates and many bilaterally symmetric invertebrates must have existed all the way back in our common ancestor, which, like modern day scallops, would have contained both c- and r-opsins. It is tempting to say that the urbilateria might well have looked like modern day scallops. This is by no means a settled debate, however – many alternative body plans have been proposed for urbilateria.</p>



<h2>Visual behaviour</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img alt="ocean running GIF" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/resZn3KENQLsc/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611571efa22bc2cfd1b2d57781cd58a8de42d32e010&amp;rid=giphy.gif" /><em>Scallop running on the sea floor. <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/running-ocean-gif-resZn3KENQLsc/media">GIPHY</a>.</em></figure></div>



<p>Scallops have been preserved without much change for hundreds of millions of years – and indeed they are very well adapted to their environment. Unlike other kinds of bivalves – like mussels, which tend to stick in one spot – scallops move quite a bit. They have three basic moves:</p>



<ul><li>Swim forward. They siphon water into their shells and expulse it in near the hinge, in short bursts. They look delightful doing so. See the gif above.</li><li>Swim backward (the jump or burst response). They close their shells very fast, which causes them to expulse water and move backwards in short bursts. This can lift a lot of dust as well, helping them escape. You can see this in action in the video below at the 25 second mark.</li><li>Righting reflex. They do a complicated spinning maneuver so that the larger valve ends up at the bottom of the ocean floor.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
</div></figure>



<p>They can both swim and jump in response to a decrease in light. This decrease in light is often caused by a predator – often a starfish or snail – coming a little too close for the comfort of the scallop. They will also close their shells in response to a decrease in light to block intruders, presenting their tough exterior to the predator.</p>



<p>Scallops open and close their valves in response to their visual environment, influenced by <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/13/2066">the size of floating particles (turbidity) and their speed</a>. They can also orient to light. Some species of scallops prefer to swim towards the light, while others avoid it. </p>



<p>Interestingly, these behaviours persist with only one eye! Although scallops have many known visual behaviours, it’s still a mystery why their eyes are so numerous, and why they have such high resolution. Larger number of eyes can offer the scallop a larger field of view, but it’s unlikely that there’s any increase in field of view beyond 2-3 eyes given that each eye has a rather large field of view. </p>

<p>It’s been speculated that some species of scallops migrate, and that they could use their eyes for visual guidance. Another theory is the multiocular overlap and high resolution give the scallop depth perception, which would be useful to avoid predators. A big impediment moving this research forward is that it has proven very difficult to record in the lateral lobes of the parieto-visceral ganglia of scallops, the site of visual processing (scallops have no brain). </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Scallops have an amazing array of image-forming eyes that are highly sensitive to light. Their unusual retina has brought us insight into the evolution of modern day vertebrates, arthropods and mollusks. They support complex behaviours of which we probably know only a small fraction. As better recording tools become available, we will start to be able to study vision in this ancient and underappreciated animal. The biggest mystery in my book is why scallops have so many eyes. Perhaps once we understand their environment, behaviours and visual processing better, we will be able to untangle this mystery.</p>

<p>Organized by the <a href="http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research</a>  (Leibniz-IZW), the <a href="https://www.eaza.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Association of Zoos and Aquaria</a> (EAZA) and <a href="https://www.wwf.de/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WWF Germany</a>, the conference was attended by delegates from more than 40 different countries. It took place in certainly the most unusual conference venue I had been to, the <a href="https://www.bgbm.org/en/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>It was a full and varied schedule, with 2 parallel sessions being held over much of the conference. Each session was introduced via one of a series of excellent plenary talks including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barbara Taborsky</strong> on the significance of developmental plasticicity in dangerous environments</li>
<li><strong>Michael Cant</strong> on kin selection theory and the evolution of social behavior and mating systems</li>
<li><strong>John Fa</strong> on the consequences of the functional extinctions of animal species, focusing on the impact on the wild meat industry.</li>
<li><strong>Michaela Hau</strong> on hormones, individual  plasticity and fitness</li>
<li><strong>Mike Bruford</strong> on the genomic management of endangered species</li>
</ul>
<p>The sessions themselves were packed with an exciting programme of fascinating research, covering various aspects of wildlife research and conservation. It was difficult to choose which of those to highlight but here are a couple of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Taking the risk? Effects of aging on timing of hibernation and reproductive investment (presented by Claudia Bieber)</strong></p>
<p>When small animals hibernate, they greatly reduce the risk of being killed by predators. As the risk of being killed by predators during the active season is far greater, this results in a contrast which makes the life history theory  of these “small hibernators” interesting to explore. Beiber et al hypothesized that as these animals get older and therefore become less able to reproduce, they accept that they are more likely to fall victim to predators during the active season; they reduce the amount of <span style="font-size: 16px;">time they hibernate to maximize their chances of reproduction. Indeed their research showed that older edible dormice are not only more likely to reproduce (delaying hibernation) but are likely to wake up from their hibernation earlier than younger dormice. This suggests that hibernation is u</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">sed in two different ways – first to save energy during harsh environmental conditions and second as a life-history trait used to maximize fitness of the species.</span></p>

<p><strong>Analysis of conflict reduction strategies in Iran; Case study: Kharvana district, East Azerbaijan province (presented by Nader Habibzadeh)</strong></p>
<p>With human population growth comes greater human activity that encroaches wildlife habitats and increases the risk of human-wildlife conflicts. This is particularly the case with carnivores. One such example is the wolf; herders in the Kharvana district, East Azerbaijan province have complained increasingly about wolves killing their livestock (goat and sheep). Habibzadeh described a study their group conducted that aimed to discover how these herders felt about the wolves and how possible it may be to use nonlethal methods of preventing the animal killing their animals. To this end, a number of herdsman in the area were interviewed.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11505" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11505" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/wolf-164427_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wolves often hunt and kill livestock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Most were concerned about their livestock not being adequately protected but although they did express a desire to kill the wolves, they were also open to the possibility of employing  non-lethal strategies as well; the most popular was using herd dogs to protect the goats and sheep in their care.</p>
<p>In addition, students were encouraged to submit a poster for the conference poster competition. There were 121 posters in total, covering topics as varied as parasite infections in carnivores, social monogamy in monkeys, prediction models for suitable habitats for Persian leopards and more practical subjects such as smart and efficient box traps for capturing wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Poster Competition</strong></p>
<p><em>BMC Zoology</em> provided some sponsorship for the event and I was delighted to present the first prize for a poster entitled  “Sensitive window for sex determination in a lizard with environmental sex determination” by<em> </em> Barbora Straková, Lukáš Kubička and  Lukáš Kratochvíl. The poster introduces preliminary work on the effect of the environment (predominately temperature in this case) on the sex determination in leopard geckos.</p>

<p><strong>And to end…</strong></p>
<p>The conference was closed with a banquet at the beautiful Zoological Garden Berlin.</p>
<p>The IZW provides a number of conferences throughout the year, the next one being the<a href="http://www.izw-berlin.de/berlin-bat-meeting.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 6<sup>th</sup>  International Berlin Bat Meeting (IBBM2020</a>), also taking place in Berlin, on the 23<sup>rd</sup>-25<sup>th</sup> March 2020.</p>
<p>I look forward to attending another of their conferences soon.</p>

<p><span>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kGzGDxZ0z4Bp7OSLioCm1fsJjFsOO1g5/view"><span>reaffirmed</span></a><span> Creative Commons’ interpretation of activities that are permissible under the NonCommercial (NC) licenses, which allow </span><i><span>bona fide</span></i><span> noncommercial reusers to hire out the making of copies of NC-licensed content, even to profit-making businesses such as Office Depot and FedEx Office. </span>Below is an excerpt from the decision:</p>
<p><span>“</span><i><span>Under the License, a non-commercial licensee may hire a third-party contractor including those working for commercial gain, to help implement the License at the direction of the licensee and in furtherance of the licensee’s own licensed rights. The License extends to all employees of the schools and school districts and shelters Office Depot’s commercial copying of Eureka Math on their behalf.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>This is the second time a federal appellate court in the United States has adopted CC’s interpretation of NC. The first decision was published by the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16u0wSpXqyUwF5xv19Ixkd2f6ekmDj-yo/view?usp=sharing"><span>U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit</span></a><span> last year (summarized </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/2018/04/02/recent-u-s-legal-decision-reinforces-strength-cc-licenses/"><span>here</span></a>)<span> and involved copying by FedEx Office at the behest of school districts admittedly using the works for noncommercial purposes. </span></p>
<p>CC’s position has been clear in both of these cases: s<span>o long as commercial actors are not acting independently for their own commercial gain but solely on behalf of noncommercial actors, they are protected by the license granted to the noncommercial actors. </span></p>
<p><span>After all, entities must act through employees, contractors, and agents as a necessity. To require every teacher, employee (including part-time student employees), and third-party contractor making copies of NC licensed works to forego payment for their services would make it impossible for those types of licensees to use the works and facilitate sharing for noncommercial purposes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>This is a huge win for educators, school districts and, most importantly, students.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>All students deserve access to effective </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/education-oer/"><span>open education resources</span></a><span> (OER) and meaningful, inclusive learning opportunities. These NC-licensed OER will help ensure students have access to the effective learning resources they need by allowing schools to seek assistance in making copies when they do not have sufficient resources to do so on their own. Further, because these resources were created using public funds received by the </span><a href="https://www.engageny.org/"><span>New York State Education Department</span></a><span> from the U.S. Department of Education, it’s important that they remain openly licensed.</span></p>
<p><span>In October, Creative Commons requested permission to file an amicus and participate in oral argument. Our requests were granted, and our </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5qEFdHYhZXjbl584E4tZ3t0B5o-IljV/view?usp=sharing"><span>amicus brief</span></a><span> (</span><i><span>friend of the court brief</span></i><span>) with the 9th Circuit became part of the record. Andrew Gass of Latham of Watkins argued the case on behalf of CC (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3BnSFVBqhU"><span>video</span></a><span>). </span></p>

Would a known biological mechanism lessen the stigma? For over 40 years, <a href="https://www.braininstitute.pitt.edu/peter-strick-phd" target="_blank">Dr. Peter Strick</a>  and his colleagues have conducted careful neuroanatomical tracing  studies of motor and subcortical systems in the primate brain. A crucial piece of this puzzle requires detailed maps of the anatomical connections, both direct and indirect. How do the frontal lobes, which direct our thoughts, emotions, and movements, influence the function of peripheral organs? <br /><br />In their new paper, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/52/26321" target="_blank">Dum, Levinthal, and Strick (2019)</a> revisited their <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9922.full" target="_blank">2016 work</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_medulla" target="_blank">adrenal medulla</a> (within the adrenal gland) secretes the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. To trace the terminal projections back to their origins in the spinal cord and up to the brain, the rabies virus was injected in the target tissue. The virus is taken up at the injection site and travels backward (in the retrograde direction) to identify neurons that connect to the adrenal medulla with one synapse: sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Longer survival times allow the virus to cross second-, third-, and fourth-order synapses. The experiments revealed that cortical influences on the adrenal originate from networks involved in movement, cognition, and affect.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DBOJJRvx_l8/XgvzdA6dk1I/AAAAAAAANBI/5YLgshRFJTM8okrzVs9iPhB2fP-y7XGUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pathways%2Bfor%2Btop-down%2Binfluence%2Bover%2Bthe%2Badrenal.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="326" data-original-width="672" height="193" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DBOJJRvx_l8/XgvzdA6dk1I/AAAAAAAANBI/5YLgshRFJTM8okrzVs9iPhB2fP-y7XGUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/pathways%2Bfor%2Btop-down%2Binfluence%2Bover%2Bthe%2Badrenal.png" width="400" /></a></div><span><b>Modified from Fig. 5<span> (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9922.full" target="_blank">Dum et al., 2016</a>)</span></b>.

Economic disadvantage is disproportionately associated with poor health outcomes, to state the obvious. Kaplan argues that focusing on individual self-care blames the victim for their response to a chronically stressful environment, rather than focusing on ways to effect structural changes to improve living conditions. In his efforts to highlight social inequities as a cause of stress-related illnesses, Kaplan goes too far (in my view) to discount all self-help practices that aim to preserve health.<br /><br />It can be empowering for patients to be active participants in their health care, whether at the doctor's office, in the hospital, or at home.

These 'Six Things' occupy a place in the pantheon of victim-blaming. People with mental illnesses are not effortlessly able to “stay happy!” or “move on!” or stop repetitive hand-washing (OCD) or avoid reckless spending (manic episode). And this is NOT their fault. And it doesn't make them mentally weak.<br /><br />Most psychiatric disorders, in essence, involve thoughts, emotions, and/or behaviors that spin out of control. Here, I'm using <i>control</i> in a colloquial (but not absolute) sense, meaning: it's frequently difficult to stop a downward spiral once it gets started. Although overly simplistic...<br /><ul><li>Major depression involves thoughts (ruminations) and feelings of worthlessness and utter bleakness that spin out of control. </li><li>Generalized anxiety disorder involves thoughts (worry) about an imagined awful future that spin out of control.</li><li>Panic disorder involves a thwarted escape or safety response to perceived danger that has spun out of control.</li><li>Mania involves elevated mood and intense motivation for reward that spin out of control.</li><li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves maladaptive repetitive behaviors (that spin out of control) meant to quell maladaptive worrisome thoughts that have spun out of control.</li><li>Borderline personality disorder involves overly intense negative emotions that  spin out of control and lead to self-destructive behaviors.</li></ul>If people were able to control all this (without external intervention), the condition wouldn't reach the level of “disorder” —  causing functional impairment and (usually) significant distress (but not always; e.g., people in the midst of a full-blown manic episode lack insight). I know this cartoonish level of description can raise the specter of free will and responsibility, especially in the context of criminal behavior. Are people with antisocial personality disorder not accountable for their horrible deeds? This timeless debate is beyond the scope of this post.<br /><br /><br /><b>Computational Psychiatry</b><br /><br />Or you can get mathematically fancy and formalize every single mental illness as a result of “faulty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability" target="_blank" title="the probability distribution that would express one's beliefs about an uncertain quantity before some evidence is taken into account">Bayesian priors</a>”. Meaning, the brain's own “prediction machine” has incorporated inaccurate assumptions about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583455/" target="_blank">the self</a> or others or how the world works. A disordered Bayesian brain also ignores empirical evidence that contradicts these assumptions. The process of <b>active inference</b> — the brain's way of minimizing “surprise” when reconciling a top-down internal model and bottom-up external input  — has gone awry (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6184370/" target="_blank">Prossner et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6816477/" target="_blank">Linson &amp; Friston, 2019</a>). Although a sense of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00598/full" target="_blank" title="Friston et al. (2013)">agency</a> (or control) is a critical part of the active inference framework, I don't think an impairment in active inference is a choice. Or that one has control over this impairment. In fact, there's a Bayesian formulation of behavioral <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027709000225" target="_blank">control</a> (or lack thereof) that considers depression in terms of pessimistic, overly generalized priors, i.e. the depressed person assumes a lack of control over their circumstances.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IEEveOpgOH8/XgpHps9-SsI/AAAAAAAANAM/pCTAVqnSmUIMmjA-OkfxQVv-eOX9zaRfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/mathematical%2Bdepression.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="247" data-original-width="891" height="110" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IEEveOpgOH8/XgpHps9-SsI/AAAAAAAANAM/pCTAVqnSmUIMmjA-OkfxQVv-eOX9zaRfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/mathematical%2Bdepression.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span><b>Learned Helplessness (<a href="https://www.quentinhuys.com/pub/hd09.pdf" target="_blank" title="PDF">Huys &amp; Dayan, 2009</a>).</b></span></div><br /><br />Using this mathematical model, you can confound the “stay happy!” crowd when you use all 24 equations to explain the concept of learned helplessness and its relevance to human depression.<br /><br />Maybe one day, Bayesians will have a stable of Instagram influencers.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/BMC-Medical-Ethics-Blog-3-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Research published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> explores a recent ruling from the highest court in England. The ruling confirms that particular decisions about the removal of life-sustaining treatment can be made by clinicians and families, rather than by the courts, as had been thought. There is much to welcome here, says Professor Richard Huxtable, but also some potential pitfalls to avoid in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Patients with “<a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/guidelines-policy/prolonged-disorders-consciousness-national-clinical-guidelines">prolonged disorders of consciousness</a>” have regular sleep-wake cycles but either absent or reduced consciousness. Those individuals who lack consciousness are (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040571">controversially</a>) referred to as being in the “vegetative state”; those with reduced consciousness are described as being in the “minimally conscious state”. Until a 2018 ruling from the Supreme Court in England, it was believed that only a court – not clinicians and not families – could decide whether life-sustaining treatment, in the form of clinically-assisted nutrition and hydration, could be removed from these patients.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2017-0202.html"><em>Re Y</em></a> has confirmed that difficult or contested cases can still come to court. However, the ruling says that there is no requirement to bring more straightforward cases before a court – for example, if all those involved agree that this treatment should be withdrawn, then this may happen without consulting a judge.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11511" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11511" height="194" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/BMC-Medical-Ethics-Blog-1-300x194.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Africa Studio / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><strong>A positive development </strong></p>
<p>This looks like a welcome decision. Whether to remove life-sustaining treatment from any patient is inevitably a significant question. But it seemed odd to require a judge to make decisions for <em>these</em> particular patients, who were receiving <em>this</em> particular treatment (clinically-assisted nutrition and hydration).</p>
<p>Before this ruling, loved ones and healthcare professionals would sometimes be in agreement about the treatment options for the patient, but still the case had to come to court, for a judge to declare whether or not clinically-assisted nutrition and hydration was in the patient’s best interests. Meanwhile, many other cases involving incapacitated patients – such as those with advanced dementia – or involving other potentially life-sustaining treatments – such as ventilation – could be made without necessarily involving a judge. Removing this routine requirement to come to court therefore appears to be sensible and also brings English and Welsh law in line with law elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A risky development? </strong></p>
<p>But the judgment might also carry some less welcome, no doubt unintended, consequences. There are risks in two directions: either a patient might die too soon, or a patient might live too long.</p>
<p>The risk of dying too soon arises in part from the logic that the courts had long deployed when making decisions about patients in the vegetative state. The key test (then and now) is whether treatment is in the “best interests” of the patient. Yet, some judges signaled that these particular patients had <em>no</em> interests. Some of those judges even indicated that, once the patient was diagnosed as being in the vegetative state, there was no legal basis for continuing to treat the patient.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11515" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11515" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/BMC-Medical-Ethics-Blog-2-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© shironosov / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Of course, that logic was previously only applied in (and by) courts to the particular individuals in question. Will or must that logic now move out of the courtroom and into the clinic or care home? If so, there appears to be a risk that treatment will cease once the diagnosis is settled – perhaps even regardless of what the family or the patient themselves might have wanted.</p>
<p>This is a worrying possibility, but the bigger worry seems to lie in the opposite direction. Empirical research, especially that undertaken by the <a href="https://cdoc.org.uk/">Coma and Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre</a>, indicates that patients might end up living too long, again regardless of what they or their loved ones might wish. The data gathered by these researchers suggest that families, clinicians and the health system at large combine to promote “treatment-by-default”. The system appears to be fragmented and neither families nor clinicians appear to be well-informed about the legal principles and processes involved in making treatment and non-treatment decisions for incapacitated adults.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Going forward </strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are recent, positive developments, which should help to ensure everyone is informed about the legal situation and that blanket assumptions are not made about what is best for an individual patient. Guidance from the <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/mental-capacity/clinically-assisted-nutrition-and-hydration">British Medical Association</a> emphasizes that the decision must indeed be about what treatment is in the “best interests” of this particular patient. The guidance, which is lengthy, helpfully includes summaries for families, which should help to ensure their participation in this type of decision-making.</p>
<p>Ethically, this seems to be the right way forward: decisions should be made for, about and ideally with the <em>individual</em> patient. Yet, there are still major ethical questions to be answered. The “best interests” test operates not only in England, but in many other legal systems. Despite its familiarity, the test means different things to different people, and therefore can result in different decisions being made, even in seemingly similar situations. Our team in Bristol is undertaking a major <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/centres/ethics/research/babel/">research project</a>, kindly funded by the Wellcome Trust, which aims to explore how “best interests” decisions are and should be made and, indeed, whether this is even the right approach to making healthcare decisions with and for individuals who lack the capacity to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>Exploring whether “best interests” is best is timely. The same test essentially applies to children and similar questions have recently arisen in relation to critically ill infants, following widely-publicised legal cases like that of <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/410.html">Charlie Gard</a>. We hope, then, to be able to help clinicians and families in the future. For now, the ruling in <em>Re Y</em> looks positive, but ongoing discussion and research will be needed to ensure that any decision made is the right decision for the individual patient.</p>

Researching our milestones, top blogs and best tweets, showed us just how far we’ve come since we launched our first journal, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2003.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It certainly seems like OA publishing has always been an option for authors, but did you know it has only been ten years since PLOS first became fully sustainable through APCs? And we were one of the first to prove the viability of this model.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Moreover, we also had to demonstrate that innovation, experimentation, quality, excellence and fairness could live together hand-in-hand as part of that model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not operate in a vacuum. We had a lot of help from some notable early adopters as well as those initial reviewers and academic editors that are the heart of any publishing operation. And our success could not have occurred without all of our authors, who trusted their research with a publisher that simply wanted to do things a bit different. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now sit back and toggle through time as we celebrate 10 years of history, but with an eye on a bright future.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/613701616/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why the holidays are the loneliest time for seniors</a></h4>

<p>The winter holidays are a time to celebrate family, friends, and community. But for the millions of older adults worldwide who have no family, few friends nearby, or are lonely and socially isolated, December is far from the most wonderful time of the year. A survey carried out by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/life/info-2017/holiday-season.html">AARP in 2017</a> found that 28 percent of U.S. adults ages 50 and older report that they’ve felt lonely during a holiday season over the past five years, and nearly half (43%) have worried about a friend or family member who was lonely during the holidays.</p><p>Christmas season may sharpen the dull pains of loneliness, as older adults yearn for their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/69B/1/113/542336">loved ones who have died</a>, or reminisce about happy celebrations in their family home that they have since abandoned for residence in a long-term care facility. Yet social isolation among older adults is a sweeping social problem whose impact extends beyond the family-centric weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year’s. Rising numbers of older adults worldwide have no living or nearby kin. In the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/72/4/688/3860151">United States</a>, nearly 7% of adults ages 55 and older have neither a living spouse nor biological children and 1% have no partner/spouse, children, biological siblings, or biological parents – with these rates rising across successive cohorts. Worldwide rates of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/8/1394/5180075">kinlessness</a>, or having neither a spouse nor children, range from a low of just 2% in China and Korea, to more than 10% in wealthy western nations including Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.</p><p>Rising numbers of kinless older adults are a result of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/demography-a-very-short-introduction-9780198725732?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">demographic trends over the past century.</a> Declining birth rates mean that older adults today have fewer children than in the past, especially in societies that have maintained restrictive population policies, and where childlessness rates are high. Due to processes of urbanization and globalization, adult children may migrate far distances from their aging parents to pursue rewarding economic opportunities. Moving from the countryside to the city, or from one’s hometown to more lucrative opportunities overseas are especially common among young adults in Asia and the global south. Rising rates of divorce worldwide mean that older adults may no longer live with a spouse. Women are especially likely to grow old alone, both because they tend to outlive their husbands and because they are less likely to find another partner after being divorced or widowed.</p><p>Being kinless isn’t the same thing as being <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-biography-of-loneliness-9780198811343?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">lonely,</a> however. Unmarried and childless adults tend to have larger networks of<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/8/1416/5373153?searchresult=1"> friends</a>, compared to their peers with spouses and children. Friends can be an essential source of practical support and emotional uplift for older adults, especially in countries where non-family ties are valued as highly as familial ties. And even older adults with family by their side are not necessarily spared of emotional loneliness, or a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/48/4/476/5423796">lack of intimacy and closeness in one’s relationships</a>. An older adult who has a stale marriage or chilly relationship with her adult children might feel a sense of aloneness and alienation even when surrounded by others at a lively family dinner. One in four married older adults reports feelings of emotional loneliness, and these rates are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/64B/4/497/598729?searchresult=1">even higher</a> for those whose spouses are chronically ill, who have a dissatisfying (or non-existent) sexual relationship, and for whom communication is silent, stilted, or combative.</p><p>An absence or shortage of satisfying social and emotional ties can be harmful and even deadly to older adults. Loneliness and social isolation are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article/27/4/127/4782506?searchresult=1">serious public health concerns</a> because they are linked to far-ranging <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/40/2/218/4569527">health problems</a> including difficulty sleeping, poor cardiovascular health, high blood pressure, depressive symptoms, compromised immune function, and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/geronb/gby112/5133324?searchresult=1">dementia,</a> each of which is linked with mortality risk. The societal problem of loneliness and the health toll it exacts on older adults is so profound that in early 2018, the United Kingdom appointed its first-ever Minister for Loneliness, alongside the launch of a national charitable Campaign to End Loneliness.</p><p>Old age need not be a time of loneliness and isolation, however. Innovative clinical practices, public policies, and community programs can help mitigate against loneliness and its personal toll. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/48/4/476/5423796?searchresult=1">Health care providers</a> can screen older adults for loneliness as part of their usual geriatric assessment, identifying and providing supports for those at particular risk. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/71/6/1049/2194714?searchresult=1">Meal delivery programs</a> like Meals on Wheels provide not only nutrition to older adults, but are effective in reducing their feelings of loneliness. Publicly-funded volunteering programs like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps/senior-corps-and-health-benefits">Senior Corps</a> that provide older adults an opportunity to learn new skills, interact with others, and give back to their communities help to reduce loneliness and provide the physical and emotional health boosts that come from meaningful social engagement. Continued investments in programs that enhance older adults’ social integration will have payoffs that linger long after the holiday season has passed.</p><p><em>Featured image credits: Tejas Prajapati via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-art-background-blur-586744/">Pexels</a></em></p><div><p> </p></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/12/why-the-holidays-are-the-loneliest-time-for-seniors/">Why the holidays are the loneliest time for seniors</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/613701616/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/613701616/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/613701616/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/women-front-lines-military-service-combat-gender/" rel="nofollow">Women on the front lines: Military service, combat and gender</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/a-job-i-never-expected/" rel="nofollow">A Job I Never Expected</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/how-china-spurs-global-dissent/" rel="nofollow">How China spurs global dissent</a></li></ul> </div>

And this presents a growing societal challenge: How do we ensure that this population has the skills necessary to lead a healthy lifestyle and remain socially engaged?</p>
<p>Two promising interventions that could benefit older adults cognitively, emotionally, and physically are exercise and mindfulness.

Given these benefits of exercise and mindfulness, we wanted to know what it is that keeps older adults from initiating and maintaining such health-promoting activities. As it happens, researchers rarely explore the preferences and motivations of older adults in this context, and this lack of research spawned <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1375-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our qualitative study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em>,</a> comparing elderly participants’ perspectives of the benefits and barriers of initiating and maintaining mindfulness and exercise.</p>
<h3><strong>How we explored these questions</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11541 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/iStock-621725820-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>We carried out focus groups with 41 adults aged 65–85 who had recently participated in a clinical trial involving Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, structured exercise, or a combination of both. These three approaches are all effective and feasible interventions that promote healthy behaviors in older adults who are in the midst of mental, social, emotional, and physical change, but we wanted insights into which was most effective from the perspective of study participants who experienced each approach. We used a semi-structured interview to ask participants open-ended questions regarding the benefits, barriers, and facilitators of participating in mindfulness and/or exercise interventions.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits and barriers</strong></h3>
<p>Most participants reported mental, physical, and social improvements as part of their respective interventions. Participants indicated that the mindfulness training increased their awareness and self-reflection and fostered a more self-accepting attitude. They also saw improvements in their self-care habits and reported having better familial and social relationships. In fact, the social benefits and sense of community were some of the primary motivators for older adults to continue the exercise and/or MBSR interventions. Participants also indicated that the structured exercise led to enhanced mobility and stronger muscles. Overall, our findings suggest that the potential benefits of mindfulness training may encompass a broader range of benefits than that of exercise alone, as mindfulness included positive effects on family, social, and marital functioning.</p>
<p>The main barrier to both the exercise and mindfulness groups was time-management. Many participants stated that they were very busy despite being retired. Other barriers included interruptions at home and frequent travelling. This aligns with previous studies that suggest that older adults resist exercise due to competing priorities, among other factors.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11540 alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/Fotolia_46908445_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<h3><strong>Motivation and opportunity</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, the study indicates that mindfulness training, along with exercise, can serve as a tool to cultivate important healthy lifestyle qualities among older adults, and that the benefits of exercise and MBSR are a motivation in and of themselves. However, the research on how to motivate older adults to <em>initiate</em> healthy behavioral changes is lacking. Based on the responses, if it weren’t for the accountability they felt to participate in the research or the incentives provided by the research team, these older adults might not have ever started making the healthy behavioral changes to begin with. This suggests that older adults may need more incentives to begin and maintain behavioral changes other than for their own health benefit.</p>
<p>We also inquired as to what type of community resources could facilitate the practice and maintenance of exercise and mindfulness. Some of the suggestions from the participants included offering exercise and/or mindfulness classes at libraries, community colleges, Silver Sneakers, OASIS international, or community centers and free or donation-based yoga in public parks. The inclusion of mindfulness practices and exercise in community programs could serve as a stepping-stone to ensure that older adults are well integrated in society.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/117151424-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Paramedics managing out-of-hospital birth</strong></h3>
<p>In Australia, approximately <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/2a0c22a2-ba27-4ba0-ad47-ebbe51854cd6/aihw-per-100-in-brief.pdf.aspx?inline=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,974 births</a>, representing 0.7% of total births, occur prior to arrival at hospital each year. This population, although a small proportion of paramedic caseload, is associated with considerable perinatal mortality and morbidity and possesses factors that may complicate paramedic clinical management. While many births that occur in paramedic care are uncomplicated, paramedics are expected to use evidence-based guidelines to identify, manage, and refer patients with high-risk conditions or emerging problems related to pregnancy, recognize and manage a severely compromised pregnant patient, and provide appropriate care during the intrapartum and postpartum period.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2613-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new article</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, a companion to our <a href="https://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12873-019-0267-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent article</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Emergency Medicine</a></em>, explores women’s experience of unplanned out-of-hospital birth attended by paramedics in Queensland, Australia. Interviews with twenty-two women revealed that the participants had various reasons for their births occurring in an unplanned and unexpected way, but their reasons were not necessarily the normally assumed ‘precipitate’ or ‘multiparity’ birth.</p>
<h3><strong>Women negotiating the system</strong></h3>
<p>This research identified a relationship between perceived deficits in the current Australian Maternity Care system and the decisions women made when labor began. When paramedics became involved, some women described very positive interactions. However, it was clear that the need for paramedics was sometimes based on the need for medical backup ‘just in case something went wrong.’ These women did not doubt their ability to birth; they were knowledgeable about the birth process and expressed a desire to have components of their birth plan acknowledged. Yet, when these needs conflicted with a paramedic’s care decisions, the women described feeling disempowered. Some women did not understand why paramedics had to make, during what was meant to be a planned natural experience, a series of medical interventions to which they did not consent.</p>
<h3><b>Woman-centered paramedic care</b></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11533 alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/Fotolia_67735290_Subscription_Yearly_XL-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Participants who had positive birth experiences spoke of paramedics who were professional, had good communication skills, and were empathetic and reassuring. They were particularly impressed with paramedics who provided care holistically, acknowledging that the woman was an individual who had physical, emotional, social and spiritual needs. It was amusing during the interviews when women became excited describing an ‘amazing’ and ‘wonderful’ paramedic who put a load of washing on, provided her time for a shower, and thoughtfully left a towel with the baby’s scent on it for the family dog. These were the actions of a paramedic who was not only confident and comfortable with the physical birth process, but also practiced and appeared to appreciate a holistic approach to person-centered care specific to the out-of-hospital environment.</p>
<h3><strong>The authors’ perspective</strong></h3>
<p>The experience of conducting this study and interpreting women’s stories on a topic such as this ignited a personal and highly emotional reaction for the authors. The authors believe that although a baby is born into a family and society, the event of birth itself belongs to the woman – she births the baby. It is a time of joyful anticipation, a moment that should surpass her expectations, and a time when she should feel the most powerful and fearless. However, during these interviews the authors expressed disappointment, not for the various ‘professions’ involved in these narratives, but towards some of the individual paramedics, midwives, and doctors that women described in their narratives. The authors took comfort in the fact that when positive care experiences were portrayed, those experiences were exceptional in nature.</p>
<p>This research motivated the authors to reflect on their own perspective of patient care as a midwife and paramedic. The phrase ‘rest and reassurance’ is one of a few descriptors in the patient care report form that addresses providing psychological support during patient care episodes. It is interesting to reflect on what value paramedics place on this phrase; is it a throwaway line, just a box to be ticked routinely, or do paramedics actually demonstrate it from the patient’s perspective?</p>
<h3><strong>Researching the ‘person’ as well as the physical body </strong></h3>
<p>We acknowledge that the scope of skills expected of paramedics has increased over the last 20 years, as has the scope of paramedics’ roles and responsibilities. As such, there has been a preoccupation within paramedic education and research that has a purely biophysical approach. However, from this research and others referenced within it, when patients are asked what they value most from paramedic care, they reply ‘professionalism.’ This includes confidence in care, clinical competence, and a high level of clinical knowledge. They also want person-centered care which is respectful and responsive to the preferences, needs, and values of the individual patients themselves. We intend that this research will contribute to making necessary improvements in paramedic education and providing a basis for a paramedical model of care that is patient-centered, embodies respect and empathy for patients, and requires paramedics’ empathy and interpersonal communication skills.</p>

<h4>I think we all need a little lie down</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*3gBmfWBS8EMX55jC2tu1bA.jpeg" /></figure><p>Wow, who’d have thought 2019 would be the year we cracked the brain? Feet up, job done everyone. No doubt you, like I, was stunned when it turned out the zona incerta was the key to unlocking everything. That innocent bundle of neurons, tucked up neatly betwixt the thalamus and the brain’s basement, revealed as the nexus through which all action and perception flow.</p><p>(But then we always suspected the cortex is a mere blanket for regulating the temperature of the crucial parts of the brain. And while some continue to protest that “the folds of human cortex are what makes us unique!”, they are denying the simple, near universally-accepted explanation — greater surface area improves heat dissipation.)</p><p>Welcome one, welcome all to the fourth annual review of the year in neuroscience from The Spike. The above is all fantasy, of course. (<a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/when-cortex-stops-making-sense-cfc52984aef0">Except the bit about the cortex</a>). But some key areas of neuroscience have seen an explosion of exciting and provocative work this year. So come with me as we take a tour of the three that caught my eye: the specialness of the human brain; the sci-fi world of filming voltage; and the mind of the worm laid bare.</p><h4>1. “What’s so special about being human?”</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CqQt-s-WrZ3LSMPXfRHpHg.jpeg" />Yes, it’s Jose Mourinho. If I had to explain, it wouldn’t be funny.</figure><p>What’s so special about the human brain? A question broad and deep, one that has obsessed thinkers since Antiquity. Our once god-like status, apart and above from all animals, now steadily eroded by science, from natural selection placing us as but one species evolved from and in parallel to many others, to genetics putting the boot in by showing that we share 90 percent of our DNA with cats. Including my cat Bob, and he constantly falls off the back of the sofa.</p><p>You’d have thought neuroscience would have been all over the question of what’s special about the human brain, what with it being the study of the brain and all. But what we could do has been very limited. Largely we have only been able to observe behaviour, stuff we can do that other species cannot: talking endlessly in complex grammars, voting for bell-ends, that sort of thing. And supplement these observations with crude measures of the brain’s structure — how many neurons it has, which bits are thicker or larger than others, which bits are folded — compare them to other species, and going “ooo look it’s different”.</p><p>But to understand why the human brain is “special” we need some kind of theory as to why any of those crude brain differences would make any contribution to that specialness. For a start, to know what’s different about the neurons themselves: what’s different about the types of neurons that exist, or the signals they send, or both. Which is the preserve of us “systems” neuroscientists. Yet systems neuroscience hasn’t had much to say about this question, because of the deep problems of measuring neurons in humans. Until, that is, this year.</p><p><strong>A. Special codes</strong><br />In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.032">a brave paper</a>, Pryluk and colleagues attempted a direct comparison of how the code used by neurons differed between humans and monkeys. They took long recordings of single neurons from the amygdala and cingulate cortex of monkeys. And compared them to similar recordings from the same regions in humans. These human recordings are ultra-rare: they came from patients with epilepsy that was both so serious and so unresponsive to drugs that they were being prepped for surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures — and to find that part, they had electrodes implanted for a week or more. And while these electrodes were in there, and while laying in their hospital bed, the patients graciously agreed to do a series of tasks for the experimenters.</p><p>With these precious data to hand, Pryluk and friends asked a straightforward question: how much information are these neurons sending? In practice, this was a tough question to ask, as there are all sorts of things to compensate for, like correcting for differing firing rates across neurons and between species. But if we believe their measurement of how much information a neuron sends, their end result is clear. Human neurons in both the amygdala and cingulate cortex send more information — in that they are closer to the maximum possible rate of information sending — and do so more efficiently : they send fewer spikes for the same amount of information. Which means? Who knows. But their results point to human cortex having an increased capacity, so that much more information can be represented across a population of neurons, but at the cost of less robust coding — if fewer spikes are used, so the message being transmitted is more sensitive to failure and noise. And as know, the human brain is very sensitive to failure.</p><p><strong>B. Special neurons?</strong><br />While the Pryluk paper hinted at something special about how the human cortex encodes information, it didn’t tell us anything about whether this is because the types of neurons are special to humans. We get much of our deep understanding of types of neurons from mice, thanks to their being the workhorse of genetics (a good thing that the actual workhorse is not the workhorse of genetics, otherwise Janelia Farm would be, literally, a farm. And about 10000 square miles in size). Hence “what’s so special about the human brain?” translates in genetics to: how do we differ from mice?</p><p>A <em>Nature</em> paper from the Allen Brain Institute tackled this question head-on by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1506-7">directly comparing the gene expression between the cortex of the human and mouse</a>. To do that, they first had to solve the small problem of accurately sequencing the RNA-expression of single neurons in the human cortex. Having cracked that, they then grouped all their neurons into types according to the similarity of their expressed genes. The result? 69 different types of neurons in the human cortex, of which 24 are excitatory (as in, they expressed glutamate) and 45 are inhibitory.</p><p>So which of these 69 types of neuron are unique, are responsible for endowing we humans with our special brain thinking stuff? None. All 69 are also closely matched in the mouse cortex. The major difference is not the type of neuron, but where they are found. In mice, all 24 types of excitatory cell stick to one particular layer of the cortex. In humans, many of those same excitatory types appear in more than one layer of the cortex. And why would this make the human cortex special? Who knows.</p><p>Yet their results are strong confirmation of what we all know: evolution is a tinkerer. We may have diverged from rodents about 90 million years ago, but in something as complex as the mammalian brain, in which genes define merely an outline of the details of the adult brain, big changes will almost always be catastrophic. So the main difference between the neurons in the mouse and human cortex is not in the proliferation of brand new types of neurons, but in the repurposing of what is already to hand. Oh, and the fact that mice have about 10 millions neurons in their cortex, and we have about 17 billion.</p><p><strong>C. Dendrites predict intelligence?</strong><br />We like to think humans are the most intelligent species on the planet, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41714">A provocative paper</a> at the very end of 2018 asked what it is about our neurons that makes us intelligent. And the answer is: the more complex the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in our cortex, the higher our IQ. Wow!</p><p>Well, maybe. Such unusual claims deserve close scrutiny. After all, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. As we have no theory which predicts that more complex dendrites have anything to do with intelligence, so we need some pretty compelling evidence to believe this is not just happenstance correlation. The researchers obtained another rare sample of human cortical neurons: in this case, from bits of the temporal lobe removed during brain surgery, placed on ice, then popped into the experimental set-up as soon as practically possible while the neurons still lived. They took a range of measurements from the neurons. Each patient took an IQ test. And the researchers correlated some of the measurements with the IQ scores. Why these measurements? No reasons given — so already alarm bells are sounding about what other measurements were correlated with IQ, found to be lacking, and omitted from the paper.</p><p>Is the evidence compelling? No. The key evidence is the correlation between the total length of the dendrites and the IQ of the patient. Namely, this figure:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/1*krE-gbokswMjqnNR9txFIg.jpeg" />From Goriounova et al (2018). Each symbol is the average over the neurons in one subject; error bars are one standard deviation. The correlation (r value), regression (black line), and confidence interval of regression (blue shading) all appear to be taken from the symbols — i.e. the average scores.</figure><p>Leaving aside the fact that this is the best correlation they have, and it is still weak (explaining 26% of the variance), take a closer look. Each data-point is a patient, so the value for the length of the dendrites is an average over the measured neurons in that patient. Now you don’t have to be a neuroanatomy geek to know that pyramidal neurons come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, so averaging over them is a bit…. Well, charitably we’d call it weird. More bluntly, meaningless. And I’ve just told you that human cortex contains about 24 types of excitatory neuron, and most of those are some kind of pyramidal neuron. This correlation contains just 72 pyramidal neurons in total. So it hideously undersamples the diversity of pyramidal neuron dendrites in human cortex.</p><p>Worse, the above figure and others in the paper are textbook examples of how not to compute a correlation. The correlations are computed using averages — without taking into account how wrong those averages might be. And they could be so wrong that the correlation disappears completely. Indeed, looking at the range of data variation (the error bars) in the above figure, I’d wager the correlation would indeed disappear if tested properly (more on this in the Appendix below).</p><p>Finally, a simple thought experiment. These neurons happen to come from the temporal lobe of the cortex, a region plausibly involved in some kind of “thinking” that might contribute to an IQ score. But that was just because these patients had epilepsy, and the temporal lobe usually contains the region that starts epileptic brain activity. But what if these samples had been from primary visual cortex (V1)? They’d find the same diversity of sizes of pyramidal neuron dendrites, because types of pyramidal neuron are largely consistent across the cortex. But if they’d reported a correlation between the size of dendrites in V1 and a person’s IQ score, who would have taken them seriously?</p><h4>2. Voltage imaging explodes</h4><p>People often say to me “Mark, you Nietzschian ubermensch, what’s the next big thing in systems neuroscience?” And I reply: “well, Mum, since you asked: it’s voltage imaging”.</p><p>To know the brain, we want to know what messages big groups of neurons are sending, and what they are receiving. Voltage imaging is the solution: the filming of neurons as they glow in proportion to their membrane voltage, a real-time readout of the detailed electrical activity of every neuron in a population. If we can get it to work in mammalian brains, it will be a mind-blowing tool for understanding the signals neurons use — not recording just every spike they send, but also the spikes they receive.</p><p>Indeed I’ve been banging on about voltage imaging being the way forward for understanding neurons for some time (like <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/mindlessly-mapping-the-brain-1dec092a404d">here in 2017</a>). That’s in part because I’ve had the rare privilege of <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/unraveling-the-hidden-systems-of-the-brain-b6c21571517b">working with voltage imaging data</a> from the gorgeous sea-slug <em>Aplysia</em> since 2011, thanks to Angela Bruno and Bill Frost. So this year was, for me, deeply exciting.</p><p>We had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1166-7">one</a>, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6454/699">two</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1641-1">three</a> major papers all announcing new types of voltage sensors that work beautifully in mammalian neurons. That last for ages, have big signals, and can all record detailed voltage traces from multiple neurons at once.</p><p>Why is this huge? <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/what-should-systems-neuroscience-do-next-voltage-imaging-9bfa5d6a4df9">I wrote a whole piece about why</a>: but the key idea is simple. Voltage imaging combines the strengths of calcium imaging and recording with electrodes, while solving their problems. With calcium imaging we can see neurons, know neurons, and tag specific neuron types to record from, but calcium itself, the thing being measured, is a slow and indirect measure of spikes. With electrodes we get fast, direct measurements of spikes, but don’t know which neurons or exactly where or what types. Voltage imaging gets all of that: we can see the neurons, know the neurons, tag specific types of neurons, and still record spikes quickly and directly. And more: because we can see not just spikes, or things that are proxy for spikes, but also the voltage changes between spikes — the receiving of inputs!</p><p>Researchers of invertebrate nervous systems have been making major breakthroughs using these sensors — in dye form — for decades. So with voltage imaging about to become a working reality in mammals, the mind boggles about the major breakthroughs that beckon.</p><h4>3. Mind of the worm, complete</h4><p>For the last 30 years, waggish commentators on neuroscience have defaulted to the slogan “but we’ve known the complete wiring diagram of <em>C Elegans</em> brain since 1986, and we still don’t know how the mind of the worm works!”. Sometimes this is pointed at theorists’ lack of progress. Or at the pointlessness of doing neuroscience in advanced animals. Often it is pointed by some group of neuroscientists at another group of neuroscientists. Whomever it’s pointed at, we’re all meant to hang our heads in shame, and contemplate the meaningless of our research, nay the very purpose of studying the brain.</p><p>Well, we have news for these people. The wiring diagram was never complete. Not even close.</p><p>The White et al paper in 1986 was a staggering, decade-long effort to map the nervous system of the tiny nematode worm<em> C Elegans</em> by hand. But was clearly incomplete. It mapped 279 of the 302 neurons in the hemaphrodite of the worm; and evidently missed an unknown number of connections between even them. Chklovskii’s lab <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001066">updated the wiring diagram</a> in 2011 with some of the missing connections.</p><p>This year, we finally got <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1352-7">something close to complete</a>: a detailed mapping of the wiring diagram in both sexes of <em>C Elegans</em> (with free pull-out and keep poster in <em>Nature</em>!). All 302 neurons in the hermaphrodite; and 385 neurons in the male. And the 6334 connections in the hermaphrodite, and 7070 in the male — including which motorneurons connected to which muscles. And a new type of information too, the strength of the connections, given by the size of the synapse of one neuron onto another. Phew. Epic effort by Cook et al in the Emmons lab.</p><p>So after a detente of a few years, can we now expect the wags to return with “but we’ve known the complete wiring diagram of<em> C Elegans</em> brain since 2019, and we still don’t know how the worm works!” and for us to take them seriously? Nah. For a start, this wiring diagram is still not technically complete. There are differences between the sexes in the same neurons, so the study possibly missed some connections. Some connections between neurons were not detected but assumed to be there due to “repetitive” wiring. Worse, the wiring diagram is still not a single animal, but a mosaic reconstruction from multiple animals. So individual variations due to the happenstance of development will have been mixed together.</p><p>Indeed, this gargantuan effort is also a case-study in arguing about <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/mindlessly-mapping-the-brain-1dec092a404d">the usefulness of connectomics</a>. For what did we learn? Not a great deal to be honest. Just like the sequencing of the human genome, the value of this updated wiring diagram will be in how it’s used, not in it’s mere existence.</p><p>For starters, we can all look forward to a swathe of by-the-numbers network theory studies now, where this new wiring diagram is analysed to death for its modularity and topology and wiring efficiency and core-periphery and spatial embedding and all the other stuff. More interestingly, people will need to take another look at the dynamics the wiring diagram imposes. Most obviously, the high-profile work of Laszlo Barabasi’s team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24056">who used “network control” to predict</a> which neurons are crucial to locomotion in <em>C Elegans</em> based solely on the wiring diagram, and then had those predictions confirmed by ablating those neurons. With a new, more complete wiring diagram now to hand, presumably someone is checking that the network control theory makes the same predictions about which neurons are crucial — for if it doesn’t, then the whole idea sinks.</p><p>Indeed, having laid out their brand new wiring diagram, Cook et al seem to take dim view of this line of work. In a not-so-subtle admonishment to 20 years worth of work, they conclude their paper with “modelling the functions of the nervous system at the abstracted level of the connectivity network cannot be seriously undertaken if a considerable number of nodes or edges (for example, edges that represent electrical couplings) are missing.” In a scientific paper, that’s about as harsh a burn as you’re ever going to see.</p><p>But, hey, we also got further evidence this year that angry spats about wiring are all a waste of time. We could instead just ignore the individual neurons. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.034">pioneering work of Manuel Zimmer’s lab in 2015</a> showed we could record tens of neurons at the same time in the nervous system of a freely-crawling <em>C Elegans</em>, discard the neurons by projecting their activity down into a handful of dimensions, and then successfully map the worm’s different types of movement on to different regions of that low-dimensional space.</p><p>This year, Brennan and Proekt <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.46814">took the next step</a> in understanding the mind of the worm: make a model of the low-dimensional dynamics of its brain. Sounds dull. But this model does two important things. For one thing, it solves the pesky variability between brains— even in <em>C Elegans</em>, there are big differences between animals in the patterns of activity of the same neuron during the exact same behaviour. So creating a model of the dynamics common to all the neurons means that it applies across all worms, even those not used to make the model. And the second thing: building a generative model means Brennan and Proekt could create new brain dynamics from a given starting point, then see when the model’s activity changes to a new part of the low-dimensional space, and so predict when the corresponding behaviour will happen. Even better: they can do prediction in worms not used to create the model.</p><p>Using the Zimmer lab’s data, Brennan and Proekt did just that. Indeed, even with just 15 neurons in common between recordings, they were successful: they could build a model that captured the joint activity and its changes in just two dimensions; generate from that model neural dynamics and corresponding behaviour that matched the distributions of forward, backward, and backing-up locomotion. And use that model to successfully predict when the worm would transition to moving forwards in the future, based on where the neural dynamics started off — and do so in an entirely new set of worms. To me, this paper is a glimpse of the future of neuroscience: a model of neural activity successfully predicting changes in behaviour in new animals. Is this what “understanding” means to you?</p><h4>In Other News…</h4><p>And 2019 brought us so much more. The journal <em>Nature</em> changed its entire design and layout, booting out the torturous 1500 word limit “Letters” that made up the bulk of its papers, and instead publishing all papers in its longer Article format — with the aim of improving readability. I’ll let you be the judge of whether that succeeded. Krishna Shenoy and team showed us that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.003">spike-sorting is a waste of time </a>for understanding the activity of big groups of neurons (and also the glacial pace of publishing: the preprint was posted December 5th 2017; the paper came out July 7th 2019. Without changing a lot). Neuralink finally announced some stuff, including releasing<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/703801"> a white paper</a> on the technical design of neural threads and the robot that implants them, apparently written by Elon Musk himself, according to the author byline. Actually, <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu?journalCode=space">he has form</a> in this area.</p><p>Then there was Ed Yong’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/">terrifying piece </a>on the scandal over the depression genes that aren’t. An entire edifice of scientific research is built upon the fact that variants of a handful of specific genes (like SLC6A4) alter the risk of depression. Except that they don’t. The links were established in tiny studies using a few hundred people. As soon as you use a big enough sample of people, the link between the gene variants and depression disappears. Which should have been mind-numbingly obvious: there is no way a meaningful link between the variation of a single gene and depression could be detected with a few hundred people. For all of us, it’s yet another lesson that we continue to do science badly wrong. The moral: first work out what you can and cannot detect with the tool you’re using, and only then do the science with that tool.</p><p>Regular readers may have noticed that 2019 also brought something of a hiatus to The Spike, the home of this very piece, with the last 6 months bringing mostly silence. That’s thanks to a combination of the commitments of running a lab, running a conference, life events, and a major project that will be announced next year… (hint: it rhymes with “ook”). But The Spike’s back catalogue is now something I’m actually quite proud of, with much to see and do. So if you fancy keeping your mind purring during the Christmas break, take a dive into <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/the-a-z-of-the-spike-efbb1ca78497">The Spike’s A-Z Guide</a>.</p><p>Happy Holidays everyone. And good luck for 2020. We need it.</p><p><em>Want more? Follow us at </em><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike"><em>The Spike</em></a></p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href="https://twitter.com/markdhumphries"><em>@markdhumphries</em></a></p><p><strong>Appendix — how not to compute a correlation</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/1*krE-gbokswMjqnNR9txFIg.jpeg" />That figure again, to save you the scrolling. From Goriounova et al (2018). Each symbol is the average over the neurons in one subject; error bars are one standard deviation. The correlation (r value), regression (black line), and confidence interval of regression (blue shading) all appear to be taken from the symbols — i.e. the average scores.</figure><p>Remember: each data point is a patient — it represents the average length of a pyramidal neuron’s dendrites in that patient. The correlation was computed between the IQ score and these averages. That’s bad.</p><p>Because the data-points are averages, they have an error in their estimation. In their plot, each data-point has error bars giving the standard deviation of lengths in that patient. Some of them are really big. That suggests a lot of leeway for the possible “true” average values (even though computing the average is meaningless, as already discussed above).</p><p>At minimum, they should have computed the whole set of possible correlations, by including the full likely range of each patient’s average value. And I’m willing to bet that this set of possible correlations includes many that are indistinguishable from zero.</p><p>The plot contains a stark clue that correlation is not the answer. Taking a single neuron from a patient means that patient’s data-point has no error bars, has no variation. (Whereas in fact that data-point is useless as it’s one neuron out of a few billion pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers). Which means the possible correlation values will vary less by taking fewer neurons per patient. Anytime you get a more reliable correlation by measuring fewer things, you know something’s gone wrong.</p><p>The study makes a valiant effort to come up with a causal mechanism, via modelling work that shows having larger dendrites increases the speed at which spikes are made — and so could let neurons track their inputs better. Which of course assumes that is something to do with intelligence…</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5466e7525f1a" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/2019-a-lightly-bamboozled-review-of-the-year-in-neuroscience-5466e7525f1a">2019: a lightly bamboozled review of the year in neuroscience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s been an eventful year at <em>Research Digest</em>: we’ve said <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/about-us/">goodbye to old staff members and hello to new ones</a>; we’ve commissioned and published numerous <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/guest-writers/">guest posts</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/features/">features</a>, and sent out <a href="https://us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ef6b58887f03b7e6e6ae5b2b9&amp;id=b626c035bb">dozens of newsletters</a> to our subscribers; and we were even <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-32/june-2019/our-research-digest-shortlisted-award">finalists for a national science writing award</a>. And through it all, we’ve been delighted that so many readers continue to turn to us to learn about the latest psychological research. So as we take stock before the Christmas break, here’s a look back at our most popular posts of the year:</p>
<p><span id="more-38811"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>10) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/15/there-are-sex-differences-in-the-trajectory-of-depression-symptoms-through-adolescence-with-implications-for-treatment-and-prevention/">There Are Sex Differences In The Trajectory Of Depression Symptoms Through Adolescence, With Implications For Treatment And Prevention</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s well known that children experience more negative moods as they reach their teenage years. But a study published earlier this year found that the exact pattern of these changes differs between males and females.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>9) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/01/researchers-identity-sleep-as-a-key-reason-why-personality-traits-predict-longevity/">Researchers Identify Sleep As A Key Reason Why Personality Traits Predict Longevity</a></strong></p>
<p>Certain personality traits are associated with an increased year-on-year risk of dying — partly because people with particular traits are more or less likely to engage in behaviours like drinking or smoking. Now, it seems that differences in how much sleep people get is also an important part of the relationship between personality and longevity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>8) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/">Different Kinds Of Loneliness – Having Poor Quality Relationships Is Associated With Greater Distress Than Having Too Few</a></strong></p>
<p>We often think of loneliness as a binary construct: people are either lonely, or they’re not. But researchers have begun to disentangle different sorts of loneliness, finding that some kinds may have more detrimental effects on our mental health than others.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>7) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/18/first-study-to-explore-what-its-like-to-live-with-avoidant-personality-disorder-safe-when-alone-yet-lost-in-their-aloneness/">First Study To Explore What It’s Like To Live With Avoidant Personality Disorder: “Safe When Alone, Yet Lost In Their Aloneness”</a></strong></p>
<p>Through a series of in-depth interviews with people with avoidant personality disorder — the first study of its kind — psychologists have developed a better understanding of what the disorder is like for those affected.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/">There Are Some Intriguing Differences Between The USA And Japan In How Emotions Influence Health</a></strong></p>
<p>Feeling good in an emotional sense can end up benefitting our physical health as well. But what makes people “feel good” varies between different cultures — so, as this study demonstrated, behaviours that increase well-being and physical health in one culture may not have the same effects in another.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/07/researchers-say-growing-up-with-a-troubled-or-harsh-father-can-influence-womens-expectations-of-men-and-in-turn-their-sexual-behaviour/">Researchers Say Growing Up With A Troubled Or Harsh Father Can Influence Women’s Expectations Of Men, And, In Turn, Their Sexual Behaviour</a></strong></p>
<p>Daughters’ later relationships are particularly affected by having had a poor-quality father, this study suggested, rather than simply a father who was absent entirely.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/">Why Do People With Depression Like Listening To Sad Music?</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s not because depressed people deliberately act in ways that maintain their low mood, as some researchers have controversially suggested. Instead, this study found that people with depression often choose to listen to low-energy tunes because they actually boost their feelings of happiness.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/14/adults-who-played-pokemon-extensively-in-childhood-have-a-pokemon-sensitive-region-in-their-visual-cortex/">Adults Who Played Pokémon Extensively In Childhood Have A Pokémon-Sensitive Region In Their Visual Cortex</a></strong></p>
<p>A study that involves Pokémon <strong>and</strong> brain imaging?! It’ll probably come as no surprise that this one made it into our top three posts of the year.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/03/researchers-have-investigated-derailment-feeling-disconnected-from-your-past-self-as-a-cause-and-consequence-of-depression/">Researchers Have Investigated “Derailment” (Feeling Disconnected From Your Past Self) As A Cause And Consequence Of Depression</a></strong></p>
<p>We usually have a stable sense of self, and feel that our present identity is a continuation of our past one, no matter what changes we may have gone through. But what happens when that thread of continuity is disrupted?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1)  <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/14/study-identifies-the-most-effective-mental-strategies-that-people-use-to-get-through-aversive-challenges/">Study Identifies The Most Effective Mental Strategies That People Use To Get Through Aversive Challenges</a></strong></p>
<p>There are lots of ways people might motivate themselves to make it through that strenuous run or pre-exam cram session — but they don’t all work. Our most popular post of 2019 looked at research into the strategies that are most strongly correlated with success.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>That’s it from us for this year! Thanks for reading, and we’ll be back in January to bring you more psychology, digested.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/12/AdobeStock_138911543-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Falls in older people</strong></h3>
<p>Falls risk increases sharply with older age, and falls among older people are a significant global problem. However, many older people are unaware of, or underestimate, their risk of falling. This may explain why older people lack the willingness to take up existing falls-prevention strategies. Because some falls can be prevented, increased population-based efforts to influence older people’s falls-prevention behavior are warranted. To this end, our team developed three prototype TV-commercial-like audio-visual falls-prevention messages that aimed to promote falls prevention in the community in the context of a positive view of aging. It was envisaged that these messages could potentially be used as one component of a future community-wide falls-prevention campaign that could operate through television, social media, and health systems. To obtain a broad community perspective on these audio-visual messages, we organized a community World Café forum.</p>
<h3><strong>The World Café approach</strong></h3>
<p>A World Café is a facilitated informal series of conversations around a set of predetermined issues defined by those hosting the event. In a sense, a World Café forum follows the remit of conventional focus group processes, but the less formal café style atmosphere is thought to better encourage people to have conversations about things that deeply matter to them. The forum was conducted using the World Café’s seven principles: (i) setting context; (ii) creating a hospitable space; (iii) exploring the questions; (iv) encouraging everyone’s contribution; (v) connecting diverse perspectives; (vi) listening together for patterns; and (vii) sharing collective discoveries. Our team has used a World Café forum approach <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcop.21816" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously</a> and because participants felt the World Café was seen as empowering, positive, and promoting respect for older people, we decided to use it again for this research study.</p>

The <a href="https://researchdata.ands.org.au/audiovisual-health-promotion-falls-prevention/1332453" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three prototype messages</a> intended to explicitly convey the following messages: i) falls can and will happen to anyone, and ii) prepare yourself for preventing a fall by doing activities that you enjoy. The screening of each message was followed by a 20-minute conversation round. To stimulate conversation between participants, semi-structured, open-ended questions and prompts were used. Table facilitators collected the participants’ responses on large paper sheets. A random selection of the participants’ positive and negative responses was presented ‘live’ on the projector screens so participants could comment on and discuss what was said at other tables in the forum. After about two hours of discussion and a break during which refreshments were served, the main facilitator summarized the key responses of each conversation round, which were presented to the group on large summary paper sheets. This gave the forum participants the opportunity to provide any further input and feedback and also served as a form of member checking of the collective perspective before the forum concluded.</p>
<h3><strong>Findings of the World Café forum</strong></h3>
<p>Feedback of the participants of the forum on the three prototype audio-visual falls-prevention messages suggested that these had increased the participants’ falls-prevention capability and positively influenced their motivation to take falls-prevention actions. Despite these positive findings, group consensus was that a more inspirational call to action was needed. A wider variety of revised and tailored audio-visual messages, as one component of a community-wide falls-prevention campaign, could be considered in an effort to persuade older people to take decisive action to do something about their falls risk. Promoting falls prevention information should be focused in community places rather than using online resources.</p>

<p>Communicating scientific findings often requires images, charts, graphs, and more to support results and conclusions. When multiple visualizations all relate to one core aspect, it may be useful to include two or more panels to demonstrate this relationship and further distinguish your findings.</p>
<p>To help you submit a figure image that includes multiple panels and strengthens the presentation of your work, consider these steps to combine individual parts and still meet PLOS requirements, helping to get you on your way to a published, visually-appealing journal article.</p>
<p><strong>Decide: Evaluate the implications of combining related pieces into a greater whole</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8948" height="485" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-1.png" width="864" /></a></p>
<p>If you have two or more images of individual parts demonstrating a larger concept, you may want to include them as a single figure image, rather than submitting the images as two or more separate figures, each with their own titles and captions.</p>
<p><strong>Align: Choose a presentation that conveys the desired arrangement </strong></p>
<p>You first want to decide the alignment of the panels in the figure image. We recommend you consider the size and shape of individual panels and what type of relationship between them that you wish to demonstrate, then determine the arrangement. Here are a few examples of common arrangements we see:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-2-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8962" height="484" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-2-1.png" width="856" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/slide-4.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8951" height="484" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/slide-4.png" width="861" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Combine: Import and edit each of your panels using an image editing software</strong></p>
<p>To create a multi-panel figure, use a presentation program such as Microsoft PowerPoint, OpenOffice Impress, GIMP, or Keynote for Mac. Here, let’s consider how GIMP can combine panels into a single figure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Open as Layers…</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/open_as_layers.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8952" height="188" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/open_as_layers.png" width="286" /></a></li>
<li>Select each of the files containing your desired panels and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
<li>Each file will open as a separate layer, one on top of the next. From the <strong>Image</strong> menu, select <strong>Canvas size…</strong> in order to resize the background layer to expand the working space for all the layers in your new figure once you have rearranged them.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/canvas_size.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8953" height="468" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/canvas_size.png" width="413" /></a></li>
<li>Choose an approximate size for the canvas, considering your desired alignment. Use the <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> selection boxes to set a new size for your background canvas and then click <strong>Resize</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong> the first layer you wish to arrange and use the <strong>Move Tool</strong> to reposition the layer in the area of your background canvas. Click on the layer and drag it into intended location. Continue to arrange each layer as needed.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/move_tool.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8954" height="98" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/move_tool.png" width="383" /></a></li>
<li>Next, use the <strong>Text Tool</strong> to add labels (eg. A, B, C or 1, 2, 3). Click in the area intended for text, drag diagonally to reserve space for a text box, release, and then click inside the new text box to type in labels. Letters are recommended, as they easily distinguish between panels and avoid confusion between figure numbers that exist elsewhere.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/text_tool.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8955" height="92" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/text_tool.png" width="280" /></a></li>
<li>When all layers of images and text are complete, then select <strong>Crop Tool</strong> to cut out unnecessary space from your figure edges. Click in a corner at the desired edge of your figure, hold and drag the cursor to the opposite corner of the desired edge of your figure, then release. Hit <strong>Enter </strong>to crop to the selected surface area.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/crop_tool.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8956" height="102" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/crop_tool.png" width="390" /></a></li>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Image</strong> &gt; <strong>Flatten Image</strong> to combine all layers into a single, flat image.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/flatten_image.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8957" height="422" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/flatten_image.png" width="370" /></a></li>
<li>Scale your image to fit page size and resolution requirements. Select <strong>Image</strong> &gt; <strong>Scale Image…</strong> and use the Width and Height image size boxes to set a print size, while also considering a resolution between 300 and 600 DPI. Note that as resolution increases, print size decreases unless the image is scaled larger, and vice versa. When ready, click <strong>Scale</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/scale_image.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8958" height="343" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/scale_image.png" width="412" /></a></li>
<li>Lastly, export your new figure image to your computer by choosing <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Export As… </strong>and adding in the corresponding name for your new file (eg. Fig1.tif or Fig2.tif). Click <strong>Export</strong>. When prompted, choose <strong>LZW</strong> as compression type and select <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-5.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8960" height="488" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/12/Slide-5.png" width="870" /></a></p>
<p>Congratulations! You now have combined panels into a single image.</p>
<p>A few considerations while combining panels: If your figures have numerous pictures, charts, or small text, they will render best at a resolution of 600dpi. It is preferable to scale each panel to a uniform resolution before combining, so that some panels do not appear blurry and others clear. You may also export your new figure as another file type and use <a href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/">PACE</a> to convert your files to TIF. Finally, if you do not wish to combine multiple panels into a single image file, then you must break them apart into separate figures. If you proceed in this direction, renumber all figures and in-text citations accordingly so that new figure numbers and labels correspond correctly. The PLOS publishing platform and community databases such as PMC only allow for one figure file per designated figure in the article text.</p>
<p>Presentation software like PowerPoint or GIMP may be new to some authors who have not previously compiled multi-panel figures for use. In order to assist working in these programs, use the steps above and also check out tutorials for <a href="https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/">GIMP</a>, if you have further needs for special modification.</p>
<p>Combining multiple, related panels into a single figure image improves the visual organization of scientific concepts that cannot fit into a single panel. This post offers insight on figure presentation options and includes a simple guide to help you to create the most effective figure image possible for your PLOS journal article.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Rhetoric around climate change often calls on us to think of future generations: if we don’t suffer the effects, then our children and our children’s children will. For some, this sense of obligation could be motivating. But for others, the distant time frame may be a barrier to truly grappling with the issue.</p>
<p>Now, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167219883610">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin </em>suggests one method to get people thinking about their duty to future generations is to think about the past.</p>
<p><span id="more-38800"></span></p>
<p>In their new paper, Hanne Watkins from the University of Massachusetts and Geoffrey Goodwin from the University of Pennsylvania suggest that reflecting on the actions of previous generations could cause a greater sense of “intergenerational reciprocity”: thinking about past sacrifices, in other words, could make us more likely to make sacrifices ourselves. At the moment, they argue, key decision makers are faced with a dilemma: their own interests conflict with the interests of future generations. Working out how to increase this intergenerational reciprocity, therefore, could be an important way to influence positive policymaking.</p>
<p>To understand the impact our understanding of the past has on our actions in the future, 200 participants were first asked to respond to a writing prompt, which encouraged them to reflect on either the sacrifices made by previous generations (“which sacrifices made by members of past generations are most important in allowing you to enjoy your current way of life?”) or simply on their fashion choices.</p>
<p>Next, participants were asked to rate how grateful they felt towards past generations on a scale of one to seven, as well as rating how obligated they felt towards future generations. Finally, they rated the importance of twelve social and political issues, including environmental pollution, sustainability and global warming.</p>
<p>As expected, gratitude towards past generations was significantly higher in the group asked to reflect on sacrifice. But so too was obligation to <em>future</em> generations, suggesting that reflection on the past really did have an impact on how people thought about what’s required to make change. However, the two groups didn’t show any differences in the perceived importance of environmental issues.</p>
<p>A second study explored these findings further, asking some participants to reflect on the <em>lack </em>of sacrifices made by past generations. There was also an additional measure at the end of the study, with participants asked if they would be willing to give money or pay more tax to help with environmental issues. In this case, again, reflecting on sacrifice increased gratitude, though there was no significant effect on how willing someone was to give up money for the cause.</p>
<p>And in a final study, some participants were asked to reflect on specific sacrifices — those made during World War II — rather than coming up with their own. Again, participants in the sacrifices condition were more likely to feel more gratitude towards past generations and also reported that the current generation was more “unworthy” and had an easier life. But in this case reflection on sacrifice did not increase obligation towards future generations in any significant sense.</p>
<p>So is thinking about the sacrifices of past generations a sufficient strategy when it comes to encouraging pro-environmental behaviour? Frustratingly, it’s rather difficult to say. While the results of the studies were mixed, overall the team found it did have an impact on our sense of duty towards our descendants. But even if this strategy does increase people’s sense of obligation, this alone may not be enough to change behaviour, as results on donating money seem to indicate.</p>
<p>The question of whose behaviour needs to be changed is also important — although making pro-environmental choice on a day-to-day basis may be a positive foundation for an ethical life, it is key policymakers and influential people who really need to be convinced. For these figures, many of whom have vested interests in decidedly non pro-environmental processes and institutions, shifting opinion may be a little harder.</p>

<p>How well do you know your best friend? New research led by Robert Chavez at the University of Oregon suggests that scans of both your brains might provide the answer. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599629">The study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition,</em> reveals that the brain activity patterns of people asked to think about what a mutual friend is like can be remarkably similar to those observed in that friend when they think about themselves.</p>
<p><span id="more-38797"></span></p>
<p>For the round-robin study, the researchers recruited 11 students aged 24-29 who were all friends and spent a lot of time together. Each of the students first rated themselves, as well as each of their friends, on a variety of personality measures, including Big Five personality traits, and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Next came the brain-scanning. While their brains were imaged using fMRI, the participants were given tasks that would later allow the researchers to identify which region of their medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was most active when they thought about themselves. Then, while still in the scanner, the participants completed the main task, which was similar to the initial one: they had to indicate whether 48 trait adjectives (including sad, lonely, cold, lazy, trustworthy, fashionable, helpful, punctual and nice) applied to themselves and also to each of their friends.</p>
<p>Using all this data, Chavez and co-author, Dylan Wagner at Ohio State University identified, for each participant, a pattern of mPFC activity that occurred when they rated themselves on these traits. They also averaged out the friends’ mPFC patterns when they thought about a specific individual. This gave them one aggregated pattern that they could compare to the individual’s own.</p>
<p>The pair found distinct similarities. When the participants were thinking about one particular friend in the group — let’s call him ‘Person A’ — their aggregated activity pattern was closer to that seen in ‘Person A’ when he thought about himself than to anybody else’s “self” pattern.</p>
<p>The similarity between an individual’s activity pattern and that of their friends related to the initial judgement ratings: the more closely the friends’ initial ratings matched an individual’s self-judgements, the more similar the self/friends brain activity patterns. This may be because participants with particularly close self/friend judgement ratings are better at conveying their personalities to others, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>The study does have some limitations. Notably, the sample size of 11 is small, although the researchers are at pains in the paper to explain why this was the case. Partly it related to task timing — because of the round robin design, every extra individual included in the study would have extended the time taken to test everybody else. Also, the participants were all young students in a tight-knit social group. The results may or may not extend to other age groups and types of relationships — such as groups of co-workers. It’s also worth bearing in mind that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/20/simply-imagining-other-people-can-change-our-own-sense-of-self/">thinking about the personalities of similar friends can influence a person’s judgments of their own personality,</a> which may perhaps have affected the results.</p>
<p>Still, showing that there are these self/friend similarities in mFPC activity does point to all kinds of potentially interesting future studies. For example, one way to explore discrepancies between how a person with anxiety or depression sees themselves versus how others see them could be to look at mPFC activity. Overall, as the researches note, the results “point to a neural mechanism underlying accuracy in interpersonal perception.”</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">A witness to a crime has to describe the offender’s face in as much detail as they can before they work with a police expert to create a visual likeness — a “facial composite”, sometimes called a photo-fit, or e-fit. But the way this is typically handled in police stations could be reducing the accuracy of these images, according to a <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-68465-001.html"><span style="color: black;">new paper</span></a></span><span class="None"> published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</i>.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">There have been concerns that the process of describing facial features might create a so-called “verbal overshadowing” that interferes with the visual memories of the offender. Recent work had suggested that waiting half an hour before starting on the composite should allow this predicted over-shadowing to fade away, and so make for a better composite. However, the new research, led by Charity Brown at the University of Leeds, has found that in more real-world situations, a delay actually makes things worse. </span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38790"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the first of three studies, the team split 96 participants who reported being totally unfamiliar with the UK TV soap <i>EastEnders </i>into eight different experimental conditions. Each participant watched a brief video clip that featured two of a total of 12 actors from the programme. They were asked to focus either on the content of the conversation (to simulate the kind of incidental facial information that an eyewitness might gather when they don’t realise that they are actually witnessing a crime) or to focus on the faces. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Either four to six hours or two days later, these participants were asked to verbally describe one of these faces — to report on the shape and colour of the eyes, nose, forehead, and so on. Then there was either a delay of half an hour, or no delay, before each participant worked with Laura Nelson at Lancashire Constabulary Headquarters on a facial composite. (Nelson had no idea which particular actors each participant had seen).</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Another group who were familiar with <i>EastEnders</i> were given the composite images to identify. A separate group also rated how similar each composite was to photographs of the actors. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The results were clear. There was only one experimental condition that produced worse likenesses than the others: when the descriptions were given two days after viewing the clip <i>and </i>there was a 30 minute delay before work started on the composite. Unfortunately, this is also the closest to real-world conditions in police investigations, the team notes. Facial descriptions are often not collected until a few days (at least) after a crime, and it’s not uncommon for witnesses to be offered a break before starting on the composite. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Two days after seeing a face, witnesses’ facial descriptions tend to be less full but more accurate than descriptions given four to six hours afterwards (perhaps because they’ve had more time to process which facial features were most striking, the team suggests). But a half-hour delay immediately after giving the verbal descriptions seems to then impair their access to details of their recalled descriptions that would otherwise contribute to a better facial likeness, the team writes. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt;">This effect held whether Nelson used the “holistic” facial likeness approach, common in the UK, in which an initial face is tweaked until it fits the witness’s memory of the offender, or the system in which a facial composite is built up from selected constituent features. (Whichever method is used, verbal descriptions are always gathered first.) </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“The results have real-world but counterintuitive implications for witnesses who construct a face 1 to 2 days after a crime,” the researchers conclude. “After having recalled a face to a practitioner, an appreciable delay (here, 30 min) should be avoided before starting face construction”.</span></span></p>

<p>I’ve been writing this brain health blog since 2013, and it has changed my life and my career in extraordinary ways.</p>
<p>My original purpose for this blog has been to provide impeccably-researched evidence-based stories that are told in a simple, fun and compelling way. And it has certainly taken me on an extraordinary journey.</p>
<p>Purpose, defined as the tendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and to possess a sense of intentionality and goal-directedness that guides behaviour, can be quantified!</p>
<p>With purpose and meaning comes positive emotions — love, compassion, and appreciation — which counteract stress and support a healthy brain throughout life.</p>
<p><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/how-to-nurture-a-healthy-brain-for-life-part-7-of-your-brain-at-100/">Blue Zones residents</a> are members of faith communities and find meaning and purpose through spirituality. Living a meaningful life seems an unlikely addition a brain blog, but ‘purpose in life’ is a concept in neuroscience that links to robust brain and mind health.</p>
<h2>Purpose in life reduces risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment</h2>
<p>Drs David Bennett and Pamela Boyle the Rush Medical Centre in Chicago, published this finding in a paper in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em> </a>in 2010.</p>
<p>The project studied more than than 900 community-dwelling older people <em>without</em> dementia.</p>
<p>All participants underwent baseline evaluations of their purpose in life. And they were followed up over seven years to see if they went on to develop cognitive impairment or symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>The study defined ‘purpose in life’ as: <em>the psychological tendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and to possess a sense of intentionality and goal-directedness that guides behaviour.</em></p>
<p>To measure ‘purpose in life’ the team asked participants to rate their level of agreement from one to five, to each of the following statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel good when I think of what I have done in the past and what I hope to do in the future.</li>
<li>I live life one day at a time and do not really think about the future.</li>
<li>I tend to focus on the present because the future nearly always brings me problems.</li>
<li>I have a sense of direction and purpose in life.</li>
<li>My daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me.</li>
<li>I used to set goals for myself, but that now seems like a waste of time.</li>
<li>I enjoy making plans for the future and working them to a reality.</li>
<li>I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself.</li>
<li>Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them.</li>
<li>I sometimes feel as if I have done all there is to do in life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scoring for the negatively worded items was flipped (e.g. Qs 5, 6 &amp; 10) and item scores were averaged to give a total purpose in life score for each person, with higher scores indicating greater purpose in life.</p>
<p>All of the scores were adjusted (a statistical technique that takes into account other factors and ‘levels the playing field’) for depressive symptoms, neuroticism, social networks, and chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>Results showed</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 7 years of the study, 155 of 951 people (16.3%) developed Alzheimer’s disease. Statistical analysis showed that greater purpose in life was associated with a substantially reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.69; P&lt;0.001).</li>
<li>A person with a high purpose in life score was approximately 2.4 times more likely to remain free of AD than was a person with a low purpose in life score.</li>
<li>A high purpose in life score was also linked to<em> less ‘mild cognitive impairment’</em>. Mild cognitive impairment is a long preclinical phase during which people may transition before they show sufficient symptoms be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
<li>A high purpose in life score was also linked to a <em>slower rate of cognitive decline in old age</em>. And purpose in life was related to a decline in semantic memory, followed by episodic memory, then perceptual speed, and working memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Purpose in life had been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414613/">previously linked</a> to positive health outcomes including :</p>
<ul>
<li>better mental health</li>
<li>less depression</li>
<li>happiness</li>
<li>satisfaction</li>
<li>personal growth, self-acceptance</li>
<li>better sleep</li>
<li>longevity</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the biological basis of purpose in life?</h2>
<p>How does purpose in life protect against cognitive decline?</p>
<p>This is a hard question to answer.</p>
<p>The researchers state,</p>
<blockquote><p>The finding that purpose in life is related to longevity in older persons suggests that aspects of human flourishing—particularly the tendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and possess a sense of intentionality and goal-directedness that guides behavior—contribute to successful aging.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is likely people who experience greater purpose in life are less stressed and experience more positive emotions. For example, <em>lack</em> of purpose in life is associated with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol, markers of inflammation, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (the ‘good’ cholesterol), and abdominal fat – all factors that associated with poor general health.</p>
<p>A subsequent study is published in 2012 in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389510/"><em>Archives of General Psychiatry </em></a>reported greater purpose in life may help stave off the harmful effects of plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Patricia Boyle said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Our study showed that people who reported greater purpose in life exhibited better cognition than those with less purpose in life even as plaques and tangles accumulated in their brains…</p>
<p>These findings suggest that purpose in life protects against the harmful effects of plaques and tangles on memory and other thinking abilities. This is encouraging and suggests that engaging in meaningful and purposeful activities promotes cognitive health in old age.</p></blockquote>
<p>A 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6834683/">Frontiers of Psychology review</a> titled <em>Something to Live for”: Experiences, Resources, and Personal Strengths in Late Adulthood  </em>explores ‘disengagement theory’. The theory suggests a view of old age as a time of life when people step back from various commitments and social roles. But the findings of the present study highlight the desire and importance of older adults to remain active participants in society through creating opportunities for social connectedness, contribution, and belongingness.</p>
<p>One of the elders interviewed for the 2019 review stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be part of a bigger group enables you to deal better with things. This is what gives meaning to our lives… We are not loners that live merely to survive; we live because we are part of society. This is what holds us, this is what I think gives life purpose and meaning…</p></blockquote>
<p>And another said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I see that there are times when I’m not focused on a specific target, and then I waste my time not doing things that are meaningful for me. And there are things that are important to me, things that I really want to do, but due to a lack of thinking ahead or planning, I postpone them or don’t do them properly… It is important for me not to waste time, not only because I think that there is a limited time to each person, but because everyone has missions to fulfill in life, and it’s a pity to postpone them. It’s not just that we are born and then die.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How do you find your life’s purpose?</h2>
<p>By lovely coincidence, another wellness blogger Mark Sisson from <em>Mark’s Daily Apple</em> was also writing about purpose and longevity recently.</p>
<p>Because he says it so well, here is his take on how to find your purpose, and I couldn’t agree more …</p>
<blockquote><p>…do the list making, the rational weighing, the free from brainstorming that experts suggest. Reflect on your passions, your priorities, your values, your talents and temperament. Consider where all of these can intersect with the needs you see in the circles or society around you. Talk to friends. Take a stab at writing a personal mission statement if you’re so inclined. Mull on the question while you’re washing dishes. Fill your head with the possibilities, the pros and drawbacks, the complexities and ambiguities. But then move out of cerebral mode entirely, get out of your own way, and hand the question over to your intuitive self.</p>
<p>Personally, I find there’s nothing more conducive to intuitive thinking than solo time outdoors… Think the question once – and only once – as you head out “into the wild” for your mini retreat. Then forget about it for the day. Just be and do and watch and smell and head home when you’re good and ready….</p>
<p>One day you’ll leave with your answer. Maybe it will come to you like a vision as you round the corner of a trail one day. Maybe it will settle in quietly, almost imperceptibly until you finally notice it’s there with you. Either way, you’ll have let your answer come forth from hours of, call it, Primal meditation. Not a bad source to tap into when you’re seeking purpose – and time away worth the health benefits all on its own.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in my <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/">book</a>, it’s useful to ask yourself what’s your north star? Your ‘ikigai’. Your ‘plan de vida’? There are possibly many clever strategies to find the meaning of your life — somewhere in the nexus of passion, skillset, employment opportunity, education and service to others. William James the psychologist said in 1920,</p>
<blockquote><p>The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently I’ve come across a simpler way.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve taken to the ‘science careers advice’ stage with Paul Baldock, a bone biologist at Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research. We called on to share our wisdom, purpose and what we’ve learned on our career paths in science. Baldock has developed a novel formula for every decision he makes in the research lab, career, and life. He simply asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it awesome? Does it help?</p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/the-neurobiology-of-the-afternoon-nap/">The neurobiology of the afternoon nap</a></h4>

<p><img alt="afternoon nap, midday nap, brain health, emotion, learning and memory, sleep " class="alignright wp-image-6134" height="333" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/animal-cat-face-close-up-feline-416160-300x200.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon in June 2013, I found myself lying flat on my back in the middle of a shop. A robotic bed hummed and gently jiggled underneath me while I watched a presentation on a strategically placed screen just to the left of where I lay.</p>
<p>After 3 or 4 minutes of humming and jiggling, the computer spat out a report listing a range of mattresses that suited my individual sleep needs — $5839 for the best match!</p>
<p>Marketing ploy? Absolutely! We haven’t handed over any money yet. But I was completely won over by the Sleep 101 presentation that was shown during my ‘mattress fitting’. They had the science of sleep pretty well spot on when they stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep is essential to your body’s overall wellness, both physically and emotionally</p></blockquote>
<p>But you know that, right? I’m not going to dwell on the benefits of a good night’s sleep in this blog post, because we’re all very well aware of how terrible we feel without adequate sleep.</p>
<p>Instead, I’m going to focus on my other favourite sleep issue, one that I’m a passionate devotee of — the afternoon nap!</p>
<p>Professor Leon Lack, sleep scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide says,</p>
<blockquote><p>A brief nap can not only reduce sleepiness but also improves cognitive functioning and psychomotor performance (the brain telling the body to move). A few minutes of shut-eye also considerably enhance short-term memory and mood.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A quick backgrounder in sleep</h2>
<p>Sleep is divided into two major phases of brain activity but named after the eye-ball movement …</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid-eye-movement (REM)</li>
<li>non–rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you first fall asleep you experience NREM sleep, and then 60 to 90 minutes later, REM sleep kicks in. During the course of a normal night, a healthy adult will experience 4 to 6 consecutive sleep cycles of REM and NREM.</p>
<p>During NREM slee<strong>p</strong>, your body is able to move, but your eyes don’t; your breathing and heart rate slow and your blood pressure falls. Blood flow to the brain decreases, and electroencephalograms (EEGs – recordings of brain activity) show slowing of brain activity.</p>
<p>When you cycle into REM sleep, your body becomes immobile and your eyes move about rapidly. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate increase, and blood flow to the brain increases (and my gentlemen readers can attest to blood flow into other areas of the anatomy too). EEG activity also increases and you begin to dream.</p>
<p>You also dream just as you enter NREM too.</p>
<h2>NREM sleep is essential for learning and memory</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists have been gathering evidence for some time that rats need NREM sleep to learn. Patterns of electrical activity recorded from brain cells in the hippocampus (the brain structure involved in learning and memory) when rats explored a maze for the first time were repeated again in the hippocampus during post-learning sleep.</p>
<p>Scientists think that maze memories become consolidated during NREM sleep. Rats that were deprived of post-learning sleep were worse at finding their way through the maze compared to rats that slept.</p>
<p>This experiment has been repeated in humans. People were invited to spend a day in the lab with Harvard sleep scientist Professor Robert Stickgold. They were trained to navigate their way through a virtual map at around lunchtime and then tucked up for a siesta immediately after. Neuroscientists monitored their brain waves via EEG and woke them if they started to fall into REM sleep. The second group of maze navigators were left to sit quietly but not nap.</p>
<p>The people who napped performed much better than the non-nappers when they were retested at navigating the maze.</p>
<p>Professor Robert Stickgold says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep enhances memories.  It makes them stronger and more effective</p></blockquote>
<p>My ongoing afternoon siesta research has taught me that <strong>the key to making the most of the afternoon nap is to keep it short</strong>. When I feel the mid-afternoon slump coming, I give in to it! I set my iPhone for 30 minutes so I don’t fall into a deep sleep (and I assume without running my own EEG that I’m avoiding REM sleep). I never wake feeling groggy and it doesn’t interfere with my sleep that night.</p>
<h2>Boost your memory and mood by taking a short afternoon nap</h2>
<p>As it happens. In 2015 I was invited to give a TEDx talk, and chose to discuss my love for AND evidence in favour of the strategic afternoon nap.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Is napping a friend or foe?</h2>
<p>In the blog above I describe the cognitive benefits of the afternoon nap. Or as I like to call it the ‘strategic nap’. Naps facilitate executive functioning, memory formation, subsequent learning, and emotional regular. However, there are studies linking frequent napping with negative outcomes, especially in older people. These are summarised in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5598771/">2017 Sleep Medicine Review</a>.</p>
<p>The review states,</p>
<blockquote><p>In spite of these reported benefits of naps, frequent napping has also been associated with numerous negative outcomes (eg, cognitive decline, hypertension, diabetes), particularly in older populations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a paradox?</p>
<p>One reason for the apparent bi-directional effects of napping may be the purpose of the nap. As the reviewers point out,</p>
<blockquote><p>the discrepancy in findings may exist because chronic napping (ie, frequent napping over the course of many months or years) could be distinct from acute napping (ie, a single nap in a well-controlled setting).</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned, I like to refer to ‘strategic napping’  — napping for a short period of time for specific reasons. Not napping to fill in time, or napping due to boredom, recovery or poor health.</p>
<h2>Should afternoon naps be prescribed?</h2>
<p class="p p-first" id="P63">In summary, the reviewers say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p p-first">In healthy, young individuals, a mid-day nap is beneficial. A bout of mid-day sleep minimizes sleepiness while enhancing executive functioning. Naps also facilitate memory consolidation, subsequent learning, and emotional processing, while providing additional somatic benefits.</p>
<p class="p p-first">In young, healthy populations who are in need of emotional or cognitive intervention, napping could be prescribed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p p-last" id="P64">In older populations, excessive napping has been linked with negative outcomes. Yet there is no direct evidence suggesting that mid-day napping is detrimental.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p p-last">Therefore, it is also premature to prescribe napping in this population. In the future, studies focusing on the link between napping and negative outcomes, as well as potential interactions with inflammatory markers, would be useful in disentangling directionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There we have it again! More research is required.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, so-called “fake news” — purposefully untrue misinformation spread online — has become more and more of a concern. From extensive media coverage of the issue to government committees being set up for its investigation, fake news is at the top of the agenda — and more often than we’d like, on top of our newsfeeds.</p>
<p>But how does exposure to misinformation impact the way we respond to it? A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619887896">new study</a>, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests that the more we see it, the more we’re likely to spread it. And considering the fact that fake news is <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146">more likely to go viral</a> than real news, this could have worrying implications.</p>
<p><span id="more-38767"></span></p>
<p>Research has found that previously encountered information <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/12/when-false-claims-are-repeated-we-start-to-believe-they-are-true-heres-how-behaving-like-a-fact-checker-can-help/">feels more “fluent”</a> — in other words, we find it easier to process. This, in turn, gives it a “ring of truthfulness”, write Daniel Effron from London Business School and Medha Raj from the University of Southern California: repeated information feels true, even as we simultaneously acknowledge it’s not. And, the pair predicted, because our intuitions often drive our moral judgements, we may feel it less unethical to share frequently encountered misinformation, even if we know it’s false, simply because it has this “feeling” of truth.</p>
<p>To test their hypothesis, the team surveyed 138 men and women from the US. Participants, who identified with a range of political affiliations, were first presented with six real-life fake news headlines, half of which appealed to Republicans (for example “Election Night: Hillary Was Drunk, Got Physical With Mook and Podesta”) and half to Democrats (e.g. “Pennsylvania Federal Court Grants Legal Authority to REMOVE TRUMP After Russian Meddling”).</p>
<p>Participants were shown the headlines four times, each time rating how interesting, funny, or well-written they were. After a distractor task, participants were shown a message clearly stating that what they were about to see was fake, and were again shown the familiar headlines as well as six they hadn’t already seen.</p>
<p>They were then asked to rate the headlines across a number of measures — how unethical or acceptable it would be to publish the headline, how likely they would be to like or share it, post a negative comment or block the person who posted it, and how accurate they felt the headline was.</p>
<p>The results suggested that familiarity did have an impact. Headlines previously seen by participants were rated as less unethical to publish, and were significantly more likely to be liked and shared than new headlines; participants were also less likely to block or unfollow people who had shared previously seen fake news.</p>
<p>This probably wasn’t down to misplaced belief in the news, either: participants did not rate previously seen headlines as more accurate than new ones. A second experiment, on 800 participants, found that even seeing the same headline just once before was enough to produce similar results, and a third found that asking participants to “take their time” and “deliberate” over their choices had little effect. In a final experiment, participants were told they could share headlines with others about to take part in a similar study — and again, they were more likely to actively share familiar headlines.</p>
<p>With fake news proliferating on the feeds of billions of people across the world, the findings have important implications. And they could also have an impact on how we deal with fake news. Many efforts to stop fake news rely on fact checking — trying to inform readers that what they’ve seen is not true, and giving a more factual account of what’s actually going on. But with results here suggesting that knowing something is false has little impact on likelihood of sharing, new angles may need to be considered.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that we’re going to stop fake news any time soon — especially during periods of political upheaval. But understanding how — and why — we respond to it the way we do may help tackle its spread.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-6119" height="397" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gray-and-black-barbell-669582-300x199.jpg" width="600" /><strong>by Blake Alec Miranda</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with the concept that with ageing comes a gradual loss of bone density and reduced size and strength of our muscles.</p>
<p>Some loss of muscle and bone density is normal, but losing too much leads to frailty and increased risk of injury.</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the idea that ageing is associated with cognitive decline – a gradual loss of memory and slowed ‘thinking’ and reaction times.</p>
<p>But here’s an idea that may be new: <em>cognitive decline and muscle loss may be linked.</em></p>
<p>Understanding how muscle loss and cognition influence one another is crucial towards pinpointing the mechanisms that underlie both dementia and the muscle-wasting disease of ageing, sarcopenia.</p>
<h2>The muscle-wasting disease ‘sarcopenia’ may have its origins in the brain</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/the-muscle-wasting-condition-sarcopenia-is-now-a-recognised-disease-but-we-can-all-protect-ourselves-119458">Sarcopenia</a> is to our muscles what osteoporosis is to our bones.</p>
<p>Sarcopenia is defined by a continuous loss of skeletal muscle mass that interferes with an individual’s ability to function independently. It is the reason why older adults lose their strength as they age, and it appears to accelerate after the fourth decade of life in both men and women.</p>
<p>Muscle loss is often attributed to hormonal and inflammatory processes. However, preclinical evidence links neuron death to muscle loss. As the specific neurons that innervated muscle — so-called motor neurons — degenerate, muscle, in turn, loses strength and mobility.</p>
<p>University of Otago neuroscientist <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/bhrc/staff/otago040510.html">Associated Professor Phil Sheard</a>, is interested in sarcopenia (and he also happens to be Sarah’s Honours thesis advisor … “Hi Phil”!!).</p>
<p>Sheard is investigating the role of the neuromuscular junction because progressive withdrawal of the motor nerve from the muscle fibre seems to be a conspicuous feature of elderly muscle. He’s curious about the ‘chicken and egg’ scenario — is motor nerve withdrawal a cause of muscle fibre death, or a consequence of it.</p>
<p>Sheard says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Muscle does nothing on its own, all muscle function is initiated by the central nervous system.</p>
<p>If the drive from the CNS is taken away, then muscle falls immediately silent.</p></blockquote>
<p>If our ageing neurons are one reason why we losing strength with age, how can we preserve both?</p>
<h2>Exercise mediates neuronal death in ageing models of sarcopenia</h2>
<p>The elixir is exercise!</p>
<p>Sheard and colleagues have published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5964256/">research</a> which shows that exercise prevents age-related motor neuron death and age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass.</p>
<blockquote><p>Endurance exercise delays the onset or slows the progress of these degenerative processes, thereby keeping motoneurons alive and preserving neuromuscular integrity and innervation status.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sheard explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>What does exercise mean for a neuron? For upper and lower motor neurons, exercise is just a change in the number and pattern of action potentials.</p></blockquote>
<p>‘Action potential’ is another term to describe neural electrical activity or neural ‘firing’. Thus, a case can be made for stimulating neurons to continually fire action potentials in order to stave off their eventual death. Sheard has demonstrated that exercise slows the degeneration of neurons in the peripheral nervous system, and believes it holds true for neurons within the brain too.</p>
<p>Engaging neurons in the CNS (brain) can be done with both exercise <em>and</em> other forms of sensory stimulation including enriched intellectual and social experiences. We have evidence of the anti-ageing effect of social and intellectual engagement on the brain (<a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/9-lessons-from-people-whove-lived-the-longest/">see here</a>). And conversely, we have evidence withdrawal from social activities is a hallmark of worsening cognitive outcomes.</p>
<p>In once sense, our CNS has many tools to remain healthy and efficient well into our later years.</p>
<h2>Neurons <em>and</em> muscles benefit from being active</h2>
<p>It is important to clarify that while muscle loss and cognitive decline are related. The exact mechanism linking the two requires further study. For example, individuals in impeccable physical health can still develop dementia.</p>
<p>Questions Sheard and others are asking include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the processes that lead to both sarcopenia and dementia inherently related at a cellular, multifactorial level?</li>
<li>Does sarcopenia increase risk for cognitive decline by virtue of CNS decay alone, or the fact that as frail individuals lose independence, they withdraw from social and intellectual engagement?</li>
<li>Are the methods for keeping neurons healthy throughout our bodies pretty much the same, or is there more to it?</li>
</ul>
<p>With these closing questions, I encourage you to look into the vast conversation surrounding neuroscience and physiological outcomes. Our muscles are important, and keeping them healthy may mean saving our brains.</p>
<p>As Sheard sums up,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Muscles and neurons benefit from the same thing: being active.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to disagree as emerging evidence suggests stimulation, exercise and engagement improve outcomes throughout our entire nervous system.</p>

Read previous posts <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/">here</a>. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/preregistration-can-bring-science-back-to-its-roots/">last post</a>, we talked about how preregistration can help facilitate a more objective and transparent assessment of science before authors even begin their investigation. In this piece, we explore the components of that investigation that can support reproducibility by making research more easily verifiable: data, code, and protocols.</span></p>
<p><strong>Easily reproducible science removes barriers to advancement</strong></p>
<p>Science is said to be facing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">replication crisis</a>, but increased openness of data, code, and protocols may help turn the tide.</p>
<p>Replication studies <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584?ijkey=b46fa089bb3e108ad507ef6767db0ad0c04eb69a&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha#sec-10">like this one</a> have found that articles which made data, code, and protocols appropriately accessible, led to reproducible results. The availability of open data is also important to researchers when preparing their own work. More than 70% of respondents to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9980783.v2">2019 State of Open Data researcher survey</a> reported that they are likely to reuse open datasets in their future research, and some rely on them to validate their own findings, increase collaboration, and avoid duplication.</p>
<p>Openly sharing data, protocols and code eliminates barriers for future researchers to replicate and build upon a previous study’s findings. Shared research outputs can stimulate new fields of enquiry, and even lead to <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/78307">an increase in the number of papers that research projects produce</a> and are even associated with higher citation rates for the articles they describe.</p>
<p>However, while many studies confirm the efficacy of sharing practices, they also demonstrate large gaps in the accessibility of these outputs, even in journals with strong data sharing policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Promoting increased transparency </strong></p>
<p>The good news is, favorable attitudes toward greater transparency appear to be on the rise. More and more researchers willing to curate and/or share their data while many publishers, like PLOS, have committed to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">data availability policies</a> that require authors to make their data, code, and protocols accessible for their published research and promote more open culture.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from our own community that they are ready and willing to participate in increased transparency. Researchers who met with us at conferences from Neuroscience to ASM Microbe have told us more options for open data and protocols sharing is the biggest change they want to see in Open Science.</p>

<p>So why isn’t sharing already the norm?</p>
<p>Some data sharing concerns are inherent to the research itself: patient records or data affecting vulnerable populations that cannot be shared publicly, privately funded research may encounter intellectual property issues. But <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Survey_of_Wellcome_researchers_and_their_attitudes_to_open_research/4055448/1">researchers indicated</a> that major barriers to sharing data and code are lack of resources (including time, funding, and organization skills) to do so, as well as uncertainty around receiving credit for their work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reproducibility is all of our responsibility</strong></p>
<p>… And that includes institutions and publishers who play a major role in the creation of incentives for researchers to share more of their work. A significant amount of work has gone into obtaining and analyzing the data, designing the study protocol, and testing new code. Not to mention curating and storing each of these pieces for sharing. Researchers should be recognized for the time and energy they’ve put into this work.</p>
<p>External tools like <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a>, <a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean,</a> <a href="http://plos.figshare.com/">figshare</a> and other enable researchers to document, collaborate, and share products of their research – with unique DOIs – as their work progresses. Publishers also play a key role in promoting these tools alongside developing consistent approaches to reporting transparency and providing resources and <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/request-for-comments-on-data-repository-selection-criteria-that-matter/">guidelines</a> that make it easier for authors to share and get credit for their work. But there’s more we can do.</p>
<p>We’re asking ourselves how we can empower researchers to make their work more open, receive recognition for their contributions, and increase the discoverability of knowledge that we can all benefit from.</p>
<p>Researchers are telling us they want to see a change in how we share science. We’ll keep looking for ways to make that possible. Check back in with our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/">Future of Open Science </a>series next month where we’ll look at new outputs that increase the transparency of the research process.</p>
