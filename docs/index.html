              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moths-pollinate-clover-flowers-night-bees">Moths pollinate clover flowers at night, after bees have gone home</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bees aren’t the only insects pollinating red clover. Moths do about a third of the flower visits after dark, new research suggests.</p>



<p>The findings, detailed in the July <em>Biology Letters</em>, come as a surprise, since almost all the credit for pollination of red clover has gone to bees. The discovery highlights what researchers may be missing <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0187">during the night shift of plant pollination</a>, including a previously unknown benefit the moth pollination bestows on the clover — a boost in seed production.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This work may help deepen scientists’ understanding of the pollination services provided by nocturnal moths, says Daichi Funamoto, a pollination biologist at the University of Tokyo who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>For about a century, the general understanding of clover pollination has been that bees — and bees alone — are the key insect players. Clover is a “valuable agricultural plant and has received a lot of study,” says Jamie Alison, a pollinator ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. “Yet none of those studies have said anything about the possibility of moth pollination.”</p>



<p>Alison his colleagues discovered moths’ pollination role while studying how plants and their insect pollinators respond to climate change by potentially moving uphill. To track pollinator visitation to grassland plants, the team set up 15 time-lapse cameras in the Swiss Alps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From June to August 2021, the cameras monitored 36 flowers of red clover (<em>Trifolium pratense</em>), an important crop used as forage for livestock. Such cameras are very useful for monitoring sites that are difficult to reach daily, Alison says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine of the cameras took images in a slice of the afternoon and again at night, while six of them continuously captured photos every five minutes. The technology provides substantial practical benefits.</p>



<p>“You can’t feasibly have someone stand there for 24 hours and record consistently what is visiting a flower,” Alison says. “Fortunately, you can do that with cameras.”</p>



<p>The method also allowed Alison and his colleagues to investigate nighttime visitors. In all, the team collected more than 164,000 photos of red clover flowers, with 44 of these images capturing visits by insect pollinators. Most of these nectar-seekers — some 61 percent — were bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em>). But a substantial proportion — 34 percent — were moths, mostly large yellow underwings (<em>Noctua pronuba</em>), visiting in the early morning hours. Butterflies and either a wasp or another bee species rounded out the other 5 percent of visits.</p>



<p>Moths are well-known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawk-moth-flowers-pollination-conflict">habitual pollinators</a> of many other plants, but their role in clover pollination seems to have been overlooked, Alison says (<em>SN: 6/27/17</em>). He and his colleagues also investigated how many seeds the clover blossoms produced, finding that nighttime visits from moths added to seed yield.</p>



<p>It’s clear “the role of nocturnal moths as pollinators of crops has largely been neglected,” Funamoto says. “I think future studies will reveal many plant species that are thought to be dependent on pollination by diurnal insects are indeed pollinated by nocturnal moths, to some extent.”</p>



<p>Alison and his team are now looking to replicate their observations at different latitudes in Europe to confirm that <em>N. pronuba </em>moths pollinate red clover in other places. The researchers also would like to equip cameras with artificial intelligence–driven programs that are trained to identify and swiftly categorize the type of pollinator making a visit.</p>



<p>“The future isn’t just cameras,” Alison says, “but cameras should be a big part of it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jet-fuel-sunlight-air-water-vapor-solar-kerosene">How to make jet fuel from sunlight, air and water vapor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Jet fuel can now be siphoned from the air.</p>



<p>Or at least that’s the case in Móstoles, Spain, where researchers demonstrated that an outdoor system could <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00286-0">produce kerosene</a>, used as jet fuel, with three simple ingredients: sunlight, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Solar kerosene could replace petroleum-derived jet fuel in aviation and help stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers report in the July 20 <em>Joule</em>.</p>



<p>Burning solar-derived kerosene releases carbon dioxide, but only as much as is used to make it, says Aldo Steinfeld, an engineer at ETH Zurich. “That makes the fuel carbon neutral, especially if we use carbon dioxide captured directly from the air.”</p>





<p>Kerosene is the fuel of choice for aviation, a sector responsible for around 5 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Finding sustainable alternatives has proven difficult, especially for long-distance aviation, because kerosene is packed with so much energy, says chemical physicist Ellen Stechel of Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In 2015, Steinfeld and his colleagues <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b00351">synthesized solar kerosene in the laboratory</a>, but no one had produced the fuel entirely in a single system in the field. So Steinfeld and his team positioned 169 sun-tracking mirrors to reflect and focus radiation equivalent to about 2,500 suns into a solar reactor atop a 15-meter-tall tower. The reactor has a window to let the light in, ports that supply carbon dioxide and water vapor as well as a material used to catalyze chemical reactions called porous ceria.</p>

<p>When heated with solar radiation, the ceria reacts with carbon dioxide and water vapor in the reactor to produce syngas — a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide. The syngas is then piped to the tower’s base where a machine converts it into kerosene and other hydrocarbons.</p>



<p>Over nine days of operation, the researchers found that the tower converted about 4 percent of the used solar energy into roughly 5,191 liters of syngas, which was used to synthesize both kerosene and diesel. This proof-of-principle setup produced about a liter of kerosene a day, Steinfeld says.</p>



<p>“It’s a major milestone,” Stechel says, though the efficiency needs to be improved for the technology to be useful to industry. For context, a Boeing 747 passenger jet burns around 19,000 liters of fuel during takeoff and the ascent to cruising altitude. Recovering heat unused by the system and improving the ceria’s heat absorption could boost the tower’s efficiency to more than 20 percent, making it economically practical, the researchers say.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grill-burger-math-time-calculations">Here’s the quickest way to grill burgers, according to math</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you have a hankering for a hamburger, math may have some timesaving cooking tips for you.</p>



<p>Increasing the number of times a burger is flipped from one side to the other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278922001567">reduces its cook time by up to nearly a third</a>, theoretical calculations suggest. But cooks at home probably won&#8217;t see much benefit out of more than three to four flips, mathematician Jean-Luc Thiffeault reports June 17 in <em>Physica D</em>.</p>



<p>Thiffeault used math to model how heat moves through an “infinite” slab of meat, which cooks continuously on only the bottom side and cools on the top until the meat is flipped. Flipping heated the meat evenly, speeding up cooking, the analysis showed. And more flips led to a faster cook. For example, flipping this theoretical 1-centimeter-thick patty just once gave it a cook time of 80 seconds, while flipping it 10 times at intervals ranging from six to 11 seconds resulted in a cook time of 69 seconds. Continuing to flip the burger led to a maximum decrease of 29 percent in cooking time.<br><br>But the timesaving benefit seemed to diminish as the number of flips increased beyond a certain threshold, says Thiffeault, of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “After three or four flips, the gain in time is negligible.”</p>





<p>Thiffeault’s findings align with what chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt has observed in the kitchen. In a 2019 article for the food and drink website Serious Eats, Kenji López-Alt compared how long it took for a burger’s internal temperature to reach about 52° Celsius, or 125° Fahrenheit, based on cooking method. <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-burger-lab-how-many-times-should-you-flip-a-burger-while-cooking">Flipping a burger every 15 seconds</a> — as opposed to flipping the patty just once — shortened cooking time by nearly a third.</p>



<p>But there isn’t a one-size-fits-all way to cook a burger, Kenji López-Alt notes. “The idea of the perfect anything is just nonsense, right?” he says. “It’s all based on what you want.”</p>



<p>Thiffeault’s friends probably wouldn’t want his theoretical hamburger, the mathematician jokes. The infinite slab of meat is considered cooked when it reaches 70° Celsius, or 158°<strong> </strong>Fahrenheit. “That&#8217;s no burger that they would want to eat because it&#8217;s quite a well-done burger,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">Here’s what to do when someone at home has COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>I’m one of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#national-lab">40 percent or fewer</a> of Americans who have managed to avoid getting COVID-19. I have been avoiding it like a potentially life-threatening virus — I’d say the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html"> plague</a>, but all I really do to avoid that illness is not interact with rodents when I visit the West and Southwest. To protect against COVID-19, I wear KN95 masks when I’m indoors in public or in crowded outdoor situations. I’m up-to-date on vaccines with my <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">second booster</a> shot as of May, which may provide a tiny bit of protection against infection, but is mostly for keeping me from getting really sick if I were to get infected (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet, I recently invited COVID-19 into my home. It came in the form of a relative who tested positive while vacationing here. She isolated herself in her hotel room until it was time to check out, but needed a place to stay until she was safe to fly home, according to this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">quarantine and isolation calculator</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</p>





<p>She was still testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on at-home antigen tests when she came to us, so we assumed she was contagious to me and my husband. I made that assumption based on research and conversations with experts. A recent study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> found that people infected with the omicron variant BA.1 produced infectious virus for about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092">six to eight days</a> on average, with some people shedding infectious virus for 10 days or longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We didn’t know which of the omicron variants now circulating my relative had, but we did know that we didn’t want to catch it. Omicron carries a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791601">higher chance of being passed on to household members</a> than earlier variants of concern did, a recent <em>JAMA Network Open</em> study found. For instance, omicron had a secondary household attack rate of 42.7 percent, referring to the percentage of household members who got COVID-19 from an infected person in the house. That beats other highly infectious variants by a mile: Alpha’s rate was 36.4 percent and delta’s 29.7 percent. And the currently circulating subvariant of omicron, BA.5, may even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">reinfect people who recently had COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 6/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>So how do you evade a virus that has been catching up with even those who have so far managed to avoid infection for years? A lot of people are probably asking that question right now, given that the CDC’s&nbsp;<a href="http://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community transmission map</a>&nbsp;is red across the country (more than 93 percent of counties are reporting high community transmission), and my own personal gauge — Anna Gibbs’ reporting on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">experts’ advice on what to do after a positive COVID test</a> — is consistently among <em>Science News</em>’ most-read stories (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>

<p>“There’s a bunch of different options, and you could do one or many of them, depending on your situation and how concerned you are about getting it,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist who studies disease transmission at&nbsp;Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>The first option is to isolate the infected person from the rest of the household. For most people that probably involves putting someone in a room alone and closing the door. We did an admittedly extreme version of secluding our COVID-19 patient by putting up plastic sheeting to wall off our guest bedroom and guest bathroom as an isolation suite. Making things as airtight as possible may help limit the virus’ spread in the house, Marr says. You don’t need to erect a plastic wall like we did, though. Rolling up a towel and sticking it under the door may reduce the amount of air flowing in and out of an infected person’s room. That is a tactic Marr says she uses when staying in hotel rooms.</p>

<p>In our house, my relative went into the isolation suite and emerged only to retrieve meals I left for her on a tray just outside the zipper and to go for brief (masked) walks around the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone has such a high tolerance for solitude or has a housing situation that allows for a sick ward. And it’s not really feasible to isolate children or household members that need care. Our isolation suite wouldn’t have worked for Marr’s 14-year-old son, she says. “He’s very social. It would have been torture to make him stay in his room.”</p>



<p>Not to worry. Marr says there are plenty of ways to keep the virus away from uninfected family members. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mask-guidelines-community-risk">Good quality face coverings</a>, such as N95, KN95 or KF94 masks, can help keep the virus in check (<em>SN: 3/25/22</em>). “The most important person to have wear a mask is the infected person because it acts as source control to keep the virus from getting out in the air,” Marr says. Uninfected family members can wear masks as an extra layer of protection, too. My relative graciously wore her mask when outside of the isolation suite, and my husband and I masked and gloved up when we dropped off meals and retrieved dishes.</p>



<p>But Marr’s son wasn’t keen on wearing a mask, so her family took other measures. “We had a portable air cleaner and moved that around with him wherever he was. We did eat dinner together. We opened a window and had him sitting closest to the window with a fan pointing out, so that everything from him was getting sucked out.” Their plan worked. Nobody else in Marr’s household got COVID-19.</p>



<p>“Increased ventilation, of course, is going to be very helpful,” she says. That might involve opening windows when the weather allows and running the bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Pointing a fan out the open window in an infected person’s room will also help limit the amount of virus reaching the rest of the household. Open windows aren’t always welcome, especially when it’s too cold or hot outside or during allergy season or when other conditions degrade air quality. For instance, “this assumes your outdoor air is not full of wildfire smoke,” Marr says.</p>



<p>Filtering the air can also reduce the amount of virus floating around the house. We put a portable air cleaner in the isolation suite. And we <a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/">built a Corsi-Rosenthal box</a> to filter any stray virus that wandered into our air space. The box is a do-it-yourself alternative to pricey HEPA filters. We built ours from four large air filters, a box fan and the cardboard box the fan came in (for the bottom of the box and a shroud for the top). Such boxes aren’t HEPA filters, but they have a higher clean air delivery rate than many commercial machines because they move so much air, Marr says. Still, the box wasn’t cheap to build. It cost about $130, with each filter costing just under $25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“All of these things you can do will reduce your risk by some amount, and the more you layer on top of each other, the more you reduce your risk,” Marr says. Also important is to keep vulnerable people away from the infected person. Vulnerable people include the elderly, immunocompromised people or others with medical conditions that put them at high risk of severe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that once the infection is over, the virus is probably gone. “The air doesn’t typically stick around in a house, even when everything is closed up … for more than a few hours. It leaks in and out,” Marr says. As for cleaning surfaces and laundry, there’s no need to buy special products. “Regular soap will easily kill the virus,” she says.</p>



<p>Our relative’s positive line on at-home antigen tests grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared during her stay. Now, more than a week after her departure, my husband and I are still feeling fine and getting negative results on our at-home tests. It wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t fun (especially for my sequestered relative) to ward off the pestilence within our walls, but it’s possible. If the coronavirus invades your home, I hope you’ll be able to escape it, too.</p>



<p>Stay safe in there!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-woman-fossil-china-ancient-dna-early-americans">Ancient DNA links an East Asian Homo sapiens woman to early Americans</a></h4>

              
                <p>A previously undetected <em>Homo sapiens</em> population inhabited what’s now southwestern China around 14,000 years ago and contributed to the ancestry of ancient Americans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00928-9">This far-ranging Asian group’s evolutionary identity has been revealed</a> thanks to ancient DNA extracted from a skullcap previously excavated at Mengzi Ren, or MZR, a site in southwestern China’s Red Deer Cave, researchers report July 14 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The finding offers a rare opportunity to narrow down where the ancestors of ancient Americans came from in East Asia’s vast expanse.</p>





<p>Geneticist Bing Su of China’s Kunming Institute of Zoology and colleagues recovered nearly all the fossil individual’s mitochondrial DNA, typically inherited from the mother, and roughly 3.3 percent of the nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents.</p>



<p>Hominid fossils unearthed at Red Deer Cave in 1989 look like those of people today in some ways but in others resemble Asian Neandertals and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>Homo erectus</em> </a>(<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thigh-bone-adds-mystery-over-14000-year-old-homo-species">That unusual skeletal mix inspired a debate</a> about whether the Chinese fossils represent <em>H. sapiens</em> or had different origins (<em>SN: 12/17/15</em>).</p>



<p>The new genetic analyses and comparisons with present-day and ancient people peg the MZR individual’s DNA as that of a female <em>H. sapiens</em> from southern East Asia. Much like East Asians today, the ancient female’s ancestry included small contributions from Denisovans and Neandertals.</p>



<p>Su’s group found that the MZR woman carried genetic ties to ancient people in the Americas who date to as early as about 12,000 years ago. Some ancient southern East Asians traveled up China’s eastern coast, possibly by way of Japan, and crossed a land bridge to North America, the scientists suspect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/who-losing-effort-contain-monkeypox-virus">The world is ‘losing the window’ to contain monkeypox, experts warn</a></h4>

              
                <p>It may soon be too late to end the global monkeypox epidemic.</p>



<p>“We are <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/event/2022-monkeypox-outbreak-situational-awareness">losing the window to be able to contain this outbreak</a>,” Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases doctor and virologist at Emory University in Atlanta said July 21 during a seminar sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.</p>



<p>On July 23, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of monkeypox is <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-the-press-conference-following-IHR-emergency-committee-regarding-the-multi--country-outbreak-of-monkeypox--23-july-2022">a public health emergency of international concern</a>, the organization’s highest state of alert. The WHO committee evaluating the matter was split on whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency, but Ghebreyesus decided that enough conditions were met to warrant the designation.</p>





<p>Monkeypox has infected <a href="https://map.monkeypox.global.health/country">more than 15,700</a> people since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">beginning of May</a>, according to Global.health (<em>SN: 5/26/22</em>).  More than<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html"> 2,800 cases</a> have been reported  in the United States as of July 22, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.</p>



<p>“Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,” Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.”</p>



<p>Monkeypox has caused outbreaks for decades in some parts of Africa, Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said at the Harvard seminar. But the virus “has been neglected by the global health community.” Monkeypox “has been giving us warning signals” for years in Congo, Nigeria and other parts of West Africa, but has only gotten attention once it recently started causing cases outside of the continent, Rimoin said.</p>



<p>There has been no concerted global effort to contain the virus, which is related to smallpox, Titanji said. Each country has been left to set its own policies.</p>



<p>That has led to disparities. Well-resourced countries have had at least some access to testing, vaccines and medications, which may help limit the spread of the virus or the severity of the disease. Resource-poor nations often lack that access, leaving them with limited ability to track or control the virus. Continued spread of monkeypox in resource-poor countries could leave places that do manage to contain an initial outbreak vulnerable to reintroductions, Jay K. Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response in New York City, said in the seminar. The WHO emergency declaration may lead to a more concerted international effort that could make more resources available to contain the spread of the virus.</p>



<p>Even for the wealthiest countries, containing the outbreak is a challenge. Questions abound about how the virus is transmitted, and whether vaccines and treatments — when people can get them — can halt its spread. Even diagnosing the disease can be tricky, with testing often hard to come by and missed diagnoses potentially leading to more cases.</p>



<p>The vast majority of monkeypox cases in the global outbreak have been among men who have sex with men. Of 528 people infected with monkeypox in 16 countries, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323">98 percent identified as gay or bisexual men</a>, researchers report July 21 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>In some countries with outbreaks, “gay men are criminalized,” Kai Kupferschmidt, a correspondent for <em>Science</em> magazine, said during the seminar. In those countries, “people cannot access good information to help them keep from getting infected and cannot access health care if they do get infected. In these countries, it becomes really difficult to even see the problem,” he said.</p>



<p>Ghebreyesus urged all countries to “work closely with communities of men who have sex with men, to design and deliver effective information and services, and to adopt measures that protect the health, human rights and dignity of affected communities. Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus,” he said in a statement.</p>



<p>Doctors might also miss cases of monkeypox because of the unusual presentation of the illness in this outbreak, compared with earlier outbreaks. For instance, in the <em>NEJM </em>study, only a quarter of patients had monkeypox lesions on their faces and only 10 percent had the sores on their palms or soles of their feet. Those body parts have been among some of the most affected in other outbreaks.</p>



<p>Instead, 73 percent of people in the study had lesions in the anal and genital regions and 55 percent on the trunk, arms or legs. Some people also had lesions in their mouths and throats. Most of the people in the study had fewer than 10 lesions, with 54 people having only a single lesion on their genitals, making confusion with herpes or syphilis possible, even easy.</p>



<p>Seventy people in the study were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 21 were hospitalized because of pain, mostly severe rectal pain. Others had eye lesions, kidney damage, inflammation of the heart or throat swelling that prevented them from taking in liquids. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those complications fit with what health officials across the United States have been seeing. “While mortality appears very low, which is great, morbidity has been much higher than any of us expected,” Mary Foote, the medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said July 14 in a <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-monkeypox-diagnosis--treatment/">news briefing</a> sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<p>“A lot of people with this infection are really suffering, and some may be at risk of permanent damage and scarring. We see many people with symptoms so severe that they are unable to go to the bathroom, urinate or eat without excruciating pain,” Foote said.</p>



<p>A small number of women and children have also gotten monkeypox in the outbreak. Two children in the United States have been diagnosed with monkeypox, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said July 22 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6d2gBpizv0Q">an interview</a> with the <em>Washington Post</em>. Both children were social contacts of men that have sex with men, she said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.29.2200552">child in the Netherlands who had no contact</a> with anyone known to be infected with the virus also got monkeypox, researchers report July 21 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. His case raises the possibility that monkeypox may be spreading undetected more broadly in communities than realized.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s surprising that we are occasionally going to see cases in individuals who are not gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The social networks we have as humans mean we have contact with a lot of different people,&#8221; Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology said July 22 during a White House news briefing.</p>



<p>Exactly how the child in the Netherlands became infected is a matter of speculation. Monkeypox typically spreads among people through close contact with infected people or with clothing, bedding or towels used by people with the disease. Examination of viral DNA showed that the boy isn’t connected to any of the known cases in the Netherlands. He traveled to Turkey in June and may have gotten infected there or while traveling.</p>



<p>The boy has very low levels of IgA antibodies, which patrol mucous membranes and help prevent infections there. Low levels of the antibodies could make him vulnerable to respiratory infections. People can get infected with monkeypox through droplets given off by infected people during close face-to-face interactions, such as close conversation, kissing or during medical exams. But patterns of infection clearly indicate that monkeypox isn’t airborne the way COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses are, Kupferschmidt said.</p>



<p>Details of how monkeypox spreads are still unknown. For instance, researchers don’t know whether the virus can be transmitted through semen as a sexually transmitted disease. Researchers have found evidence of <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.28.2200503">viral DNA in semen</a>, saliva, urine and feces, but that may just be inactive remnants of the virus. So far, no researchers have reported finding infectious virus in genital body fluids that might be exchanged during sex. Also unknown is whether getting infected through mucous membranes during sexual contact would shield against catching the virus later, Rimoin said.</p>



<p>Scientists are questioning whether the monkeypox virus has changed or whether it has simply found a niche social-sexual network among gay and bisexual men that may enable the virus to spread more efficiently, Titanji said. It may be that there are different transmission patterns in historically affected countries and newly affected countries that require different strategies to stop the spread, she said.</p>



<p>Researchers also need to do good studies to figure out how well vaccines and therapeutics work and under what circumstances, Rimoin said. WHO’s emergency declaration includes recommendations for increasing testing and surveillance and for seeding up research on vaccines, treatments and other virus containment measures.</p>



<p>One thing is clear, Rimoin said. “We’re giving this virus room to run like it never has before.” People have passed the buck, leaving others to work out the problem of monkeypox, she said. But now, “it’s everybody’s problem to solve.”</p>

                <p>Potential hints of weird new particles in a dark matter detector have evaporated with new data.</p>



<p>Following up on a beguiling result from its predecessor experiment, the XENONnT experiment found <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/922783/contributions/4892806/">no sign of extra blips</a> that could point to new particles or another phenomenon, scientists report July 22 in Vienna at the International Conference on Identification of Dark Matter.</p>



<p>The XENONnT experiment (pronounced “xenon n ton”), at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, uses 5.9 metric tons of liquid xenon to search for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed?mode=magazine&amp;context=192525">dark matter</a>, an elusive substance that so far has been seen only via its gravitational effects in the cosmos (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>). The detector is designed to look for dark matter particles crashing into xenon atoms’ nuclei, causing them to recoil. But the detector can also spot recoiling electrons.</p>





<p>In 2020, a smaller version of the experiment, called XENON1T, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unexpected-result-dark-matter-experiment-new-particles">reported greater-than-expected numbers</a> of those ricocheting electrons (<em>SN: 6/17/20</em>). “This caused a lot of stir when we published it,” says physicist Rafael Lang of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>That surplus, some scientists suggested, could have been explained by some unexpected new physics, such as hypothetical lightweight particles that may originate from the sun called solar axions. But the excess wasn’t large enough to be convincing, so more data were needed.</p>



<p>In the new analysis, which uses about 97 days of data, XENONnT spotted as many electron recoils as expected due to known particle interactions, the researchers also reported <a href="https://www.science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/XENONnT_SR0_lowER-48.pdf">in a paper</a> posted on the experiment’s website. Scientists don’t know what caused the extra detections in the previous experiment, but it’s possible it was merely a statistical fluke, Lang says. Or it may have been due to small amounts of tritium — hydrogen atoms with two neutrons in their nuclei — in the detector. </p>



<p>With the red herring out of the way, XENONnT researchers are now combing through their data for nuclear recoils, in hopes of detecting the real deal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">The heaviest neutron star on record is 2.35 times the mass of the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fast-spinning neutron star south of the constellation Leo is the most massive of its kind seen so far, according to new observations.</p>



<p>The record-setting collapsed star, named PSR J0952-0607, weighs <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05124">about 2.35 times as much as the sun,</a> researchers report July 11 on arXiv.org. “That’s the heaviest well-measured neutron star that has been found to date,” says study coauthor Roger Romani, an astrophysicist at Stanford University.</p>



<p>The previous record holder was a neutron star in the northern constellation Camelopardalis named PSR J0740+6620, which tipped the scales at <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac03b8">about 2.08 times as massive as the sun</a>. If a neutron star grows too massive, it collapses under its own weight and becomes a black hole. These measurements of hefty neutron stars are of interest because no one knows the exact mass boundary between neutron stars and black holes.</p>





<p>That dividing line drives the quest to find the most massive neutron stars and determine just how massive they can be, Romani says. “It’s defining the boundary between the visible things in the universe and the stuff that is forever hidden from us inside of a black hole,” he says. “A neutron star that’s on the hairy edge of becoming a black hole — just about heavy enough to collapse — has at its center the very densest material that we can access in the entire visible universe.”</p>



<p>PSR J0952-0607 is in the constellation Sextans, just south of Leo. It resides 20,000 light-years from Earth, far above the galaxy’s plane in the Milky Way’s halo. The neutron star emits a pulse of radio waves toward us each time it spins, so astronomers also classify the object as a pulsar. First reported in 2017, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa8400">this pulsar spins every 1.41 milliseconds</a>, faster than all but one other pulsar.</p>



<p>That’s why Romani and his colleagues chose to study it — the fast spin led them to suspect that the pulsar might be unusually heavy. That’s because another star orbits the pulsar, and just as water spilling over a water wheel spins it up, gas falling from that companion onto the pulsar could have sped up its rotation while also boosting its mass.</p>



<p>Observing the companion, Romani and his colleagues found that it whips around the pulsar quickly — at about 380 kilometers per second. Using the companion’s speed and its orbital period of about six and a half hours, the team calculated the pulsar’s mass to be more than twice the mass of the sun. That’s a lot heavier than the typical neutron star, which is only about 1.4 times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>“It’s a terrific study,” says Emmanuel Fonseca, a radio astronomer at West Virginia University in Morgantown who measured the mass of the previous record holder but was not involved in the new work. “It helps nuclear physicists actually constrain the nature of matter within these extreme environments.”</p>

The key idea is that cognition, which includes thinking and decision-making, is inseparable from embodiment. This is not just because it requires sensory inputs to the brain, but also because moving in the world is a key component. Thus embodied cognition does not see this as a passive input/output process, but as something that requires constant interaction with the world via the body.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3i4FfTm" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind</a></em> by Evan Thompson</li> <li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3N7Vwmr" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</a></em> by Francisco J.

<p>Many healthcare services do not have the resources or capacity to subculture positive blood samples to diagnose bloodstream infections. As a result, centralisation of diagnostic laboratory services is becoming popular. &#8216;Centralisation&#8217; describes building up one &#8216;central&#8217; laboratory while closing or downgrading peripheral or smaller laboratories. In order to better utilise healthcare resources and save money, blood samples are increasingly being shipped to a central location for processing. In some low- and middle-income countries, a lack of necessary infrastructure and resources may mean that centralisation is the only viable option.</p>
<p>However, the impact of delaying the subculture of positive blood samples on the diagnostic yield of pathogens while they are shipped to central locations remains relatively unknown. In <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em>, researchers find that delaying subculture for up to a week didn&#8217;t impact the diagnostic yield for almost all of the pathogens investigated, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. However, the researchers demonstrate that storage temperature may affect viability, especially in tropical settings. The study provides useful data to consider when setting up new diagnostic microbiology services.</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm every year before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. These premature babies have a much higher risk of osteopenia. This condition leads to reduced bone mineral density and subsequent disease due to multiple prenatal and postnatal factors that impair bone remodelling.</p>
<p>Bone remodelling is essential for normal growth and development. Osteoclasts remove old bone while osteoblasts lay new. Normally, these two cell types work in balance, but if the rate of bone resorption outpaces new bone formation, the skeleton can become weak.</p>
<p>Physical activities that exert mechanical stress on the bones stimulate bone growth. In <em>BMC Pediatrics</em>, researchers performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the effect of three different physiotherapeutic methods on bone remodelling in preterm infants. The study found that reflex locomotion therapy (RLT) increased levels of bone formation biomarkers and the height of preterm infants. These results suggest that RLT positively affects bone formation and growth, which may help prevent and treat osteopenia in this population.</p>

<p>How did COVID-19 pandemic restrictions affect the lifestyle and health of our dogs? To help answer this question, researchers from the University of Edinburgh analysed data from over 4000 Labrador owners in England between March and July 2020.</p>
<p>The study found that Labradors visited the vets less often during this time and were less likely to be insured. This finding suggests that dogs might not have received their usual level of veterinary care. In addition, the number of vaccinations in Labradors also decreased during lockdown &#8211; this finding is valuable to prompt owners to check their dog&#8217;s vaccination history is up to date.</p>
<p>However, positives also accompanied pandemic restrictions. For example, Labradors enjoyed increased exercise, were more likely to be wormed and were less likely to be given treats by their owners. Labrador owners also reported less coughing by their dogs. This observation led to the researchers speculating that lockdown decreased the spread of infectious diseases like kennel cough due to a reduction in dogs&#8217; social interactions.</p>

<p>How did COVID-19 pandemic restrictions impact the mental health of pregnant women, postpartum women, and their partners? In <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>, researchers used data from an ongoing life-course pregnancy study known as the Queensland Family Cohort at the Mater Mother’s Hospital in Australia to help answer this question.</p>
<p>Pregnant women and their partners were prospectively recruited to the study before 24 weeks gestation. The 454 families participating in the study then completed questionnaires relating to mental health and general wellbeing at 24 weeks gestation and as well as 6 weeks postpartum. Families were recruited before (Aug 2018-Feb 2020), during (Mar-Aug 2020) and after the first lockdown was over (Sept-Dec 2020).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the lockdown did not negatively affect the mental health of the assessed population in Brisbane, Australia. On the contrary, the odds of pregnant women or postpartum women experiencing severe anxiety was more than halved in women during lockdown relative to women in the pre-COVID-19 period. In addition, the odds of pregnant and postpartum women experiencing severe stress decreased by over 70% post-lockdown relative to pre-COVID-19 levels.</p>

<p>High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) provides respiratory support for patients with acute hypoxemia respiratory failure (AHRF) &#8211; one of the most common causes of critical illness. However, in cases of HFNC failure, progressing treatment to mechanical ventilation is required. Mechanical ventilation delay is associated with increased mortality risk. In <em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</em>, researchers reviewed the records of 75 patients with AHRF treated with HFNC to identify early predictors of HFNC success to avoid mechanical ventilation delay and reduce mortality risk. The study finds that two hours after HFNC initiation, a modified respiratory rate oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2/RR) of less than 7.1 predicts success with HFNC therapy with 100% specificity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/herminia-pasantes-taurine-brain-cell-neuroscience">Herminia Pasantes discovered how taurine helps brain cells regulate their size</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Herminia Pasantes Ordóñez was about 14 years old, in 1950, she heard her mother tell her father that she would never find a husband. Pasantes had to wear thick glasses for her poor eyesight. In her mother’s eyes, those glasses meant her future as a “good woman” was doomed. “This made my life easier,” says Pasantes, “because it was already said that I was going to study.”</p>



<p>At a time when it was uncommon for women to become scientists, Pasantes studied biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, or UNAM. She was the first member of her family to go to college.</p>





<p>She became a neurobiologist and one of the most important Mexican scientists of her time. Her studies on the role of the chemical taurine in the brain offer deep insights into how cells maintain their size — essential to proper functioning. In 2001, she became the first woman to earn Mexico’s <a href="https://www.uv.mx/investigacion/convocatorias/premio-nacional-de-ciencias-y-artes-70-anos/">National Prize for Sciences and Arts</a> in the area of physical, mathematical and natural sciences.</p>



<p>“We basically learned about cell volume regulation through the eyes and work of Herminia,” says Alexander Mongin, a Belarusian neuroscientist at Albany Medical College in New York.</p>



<p>Pasantes did get married, in 1965 while doing her master’s in biochemistry at UNAM. She had a daughter in 1966 and a son in 1967 before starting a Ph.D. in natural sciences in 1970 at the <a href="https://en.unistra.fr/research/life-sciences-and-health/centre-for-neurochemistry-ups-3156">Center for Neurochemistry</a> at the University of Strasbourg in France. There, she worked in the laboratory of <a href="https://fondation.unistra.fr/impact/paul-mandel-un-precurseur-strasbourgeois-en-neurochimie/">Paul Mandel</a>, a Polish pioneer in neurochemistry.</p>



<p>The lab was trying to find out everything there was to know about the retina, the layer of tissue at the back of the eye that is sensitive to light. Pasantes decided to test whether free amino acids, a group that aren’t incorporated into proteins, were present in the retinas and brain of mice. Her first chromatography — a lab technique that lets scientists separate and identify the components of a sample — showed an immense amount of taurine in both tissues. Taurine would drive the rest of her scientific career, including work in her own lab, which she started around 1975 at the Institute of Cellular Physiology at UNAM.</p>



<p>Taurine turns out to be widely distributed in animal tissues and has diverse biological functions, some of which were discovered by Pasantes. Her research found that taurine helps maintain cell volume in nerve cells, and that it protects brain, muscle, heart and retinal cells by preventing the death of stem cells, which give rise to all specialized cells in the body.</p>

<p>Contrary to what most scientists had believed at the time, taurine didn’t work as a neurotransmitter sending messages between nerve cells. Pasantes demonstrated for the first time that it worked as an osmolyte in the brain. Osmolytes help maintain the size and integrity of cells by opening up channels in their membranes to get water in or out.</p>



<p>Pasantes says she spent many years looking for an answer for why there is so much taurine in the brain. “When you ask nature a question, 80 to 90 percent of the time, it responds no,” she says. “But when it answers yes, it’s wonderful.”</p>



<p>Pasantes’ lab was one of the big four labs that did groundbreaking work on cell volume regulation in the brain, says Mongin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her work and that of others proved taurine has a protective effect; it’s the reason the chemical is today sprinkled in the containers that carry organs for transplants. Pasantes’ work was the foundation for our understanding of how to prevent and treat brain edema, a condition where the brain swells due to excessive accumulation of fluid, from head trauma or reduced blood supply, for example. She and other experts also reviewed the role of taurine for Red Bull, which added the chemical to its formula because of potentially protective effects in the heart.</p>



<p>Pasantes stopped doing research in 2019 and spends her time talking and writing about science. She hopes her story speaks to women around the world who wish to be scientists: “It is important to send the message that it is possible,” she says.</p>



<p>Years before she was accepted into Mandel’s lab, her application to a Ph.D. in biochemistry at the UNAM was rejected. Pasantes says the reason was that she had just had her daughter. Looking back, this moment was “one of the most wonderful things that could’ve happened to me,” Pasantes says, because she ended up in Strasbourg, where her potential as a researcher bloomed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uaeh.edu.mx/campus/icshu/nucleo-academico/rosa-maria.html">Rosa María González Victoria</a>, a social scientist at the Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo in Pachuca, Mexico, who specializes in gender studies, recently interviewed Pasantes for <a href="https://repository.uaeh.edu.mx/books/40/vd.pdf">a book about Mexican women in science</a>. González Victoria thinks Pasantes’ response to that early rejection speaks to the kind of person she is: “A woman that takes those no’s and turns them into yes’s.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-galaxy-stars-data">How James Webb Space Telescope data have already revealed surprises</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massimo Pascale wasn’t planning to study the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. But as soon as he saw the cluster glittering in the first image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, he and his colleagues couldn’t help themselves.</p>



<p>“We were like, we have to do something,” says Pascale, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. “We can’t stop ourselves from analyzing this data. It was so exciting.”</p>



<p>Pascale’s team is one of several groups of scientists who saw the first JWST images and immediately rolled up their sleeves. In the first few days after images and the data used to create them were made public, scientists have estimated the amount of mass the cluster contains, uncovered a violent incident in the cluster’s recent past and estimated the ages of the stars in galaxies far beyond the cluster itself.</p>





<p>“We’ve been preparing for this for a long time. Myself, I’ve been preparing for years, and I’m not very old,” says Pascale, who is in his fourth year of graduate school. &nbsp;JWST “is really going to define a new generation of astronomers and a new generation of science as a whole.”</p>





<h4>Cluster collision</h4>



<p>When the image of SMACS 0723 was released in a White House briefing on July 11, most of the focus went to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">extremely distant galaxies in the background</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). But smack in the middle of the image is SMACS 0723 itself, a much closer cluster of galaxies about 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. Its mass bends light from even farther away, making more distant objects appear magnified, as if their light had traveled through the lens of another cosmic-sized telescope.</p>



<p>The light from the most distant galaxy in this image started its journey to JWST about 13.3 billion years ago — “almost at the dawn of the universe,” says astrophysicist Guillaume Mahler of Durham University in England, who is already using the picture as his Zoom background.</p>



<p>But the image can also fill in the history of the intervening galaxy cluster itself. “People sometimes forget about that — the galaxy cluster is also very important,” Pascale says.</p>



<p>Pascale’s and Mahler’s teams each started by taking inventory of the distant galaxies that appear stretched and distorted in the image. The light from some of those galaxies is warped such that multiple images of the same galaxy appear in different places. Mapping those multiply imaged galaxies is a sensitive probe of the way mass is spread around the cluster. That, in turn, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-clumps-galaxy-clusters-bend-light-surprisingly-well">reveal where the cluster contains dark matter</a>, the invisible, mysterious substance that makes up the majority of the mass in the universe (<em>SN: 9/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>Both teams found that SMACS 0723 is more elongated than it appeared in previous observations. They also found a faint glow, called intracluster light, inside the cluster from stars that don’t belong to any particular galaxy. Together, those features suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07101">SMACS 0723 is still recovering</a> from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07102">relatively recent smash-up</a> with another galaxy cluster, the teams report separately in a pair of papers submitted to arXiv.org on July 14.</p>



<p>A galaxy cluster that has been sitting on its own for eons should have a rounder distribution of matter and intracluster light, rather than SMACS 0723’s oblong shape. The stars that emit the intracluster light were probably ripped from their home galaxies by gravitational forces during the collision.</p>



<p>“Two separate clusters have merged together, and it looks to us as if it’s not totally settled yet,” Pascale says. “What we might be looking at is an ongoing merger.”</p>

<h4>Far-flung galaxies</h4>



<p>Mapping out mass in the cluster is also essential to decoding the properties of the more distant galaxies in the background of the image, Mahler says. “You need to understand the cluster and its magnification power to understand what’s behind.”</p>



<p>Some scientists are already investigating those distant galaxies in detail. The first JWST data include not just pretty pictures but also spectra, measurements of how much light an object emits at various wavelengths. Spectra allow scientists to determine how much a distant object’s light has been stretched — or redshifted — by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime#cosmic-expansion">expansion of the universe</a>, which is a proxy for its distance. Such data can also help reveal a galaxy’s composition and the ages of its stars.</p>



<p>“The main thing that limits the study of star formation in galaxies is the quality of the data,” says astrophysicist Adam Carnall of the University of Edinburgh. But with the vastly improved data from JWST, he says, he and his team were able to measure the ages of stars in those remote galaxies.</p>



<p>Carnall and colleagues turned their attention to the spectra of the distant galaxies just a few days after the SMACS image was released. They measured the redshifts of 10 galaxies, five of which <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08778">were particularly distant</a>, the team reports in a paper submitted to arXiv.org on July 18. One had already been highlighted as one of the most distant galaxy ever seen, with light that was emitted just 500 million years after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The other four shone as late as 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>All 10 galaxies were relatively young when they emitted the light captured by JWST, Carnall says. They had all switched on their star formation just a few million years earlier. That’s not especially surprising, but it is interesting.</p>



<p>“The ability to look at these small, faint galaxies … gives you a sense of how all galaxies must look when they start forming stars,” Carnall says.</p>



<p>Scientists hope to use JWST to find the first instances of star formation ever. Other early results suggest they’re already getting close.</p>



<p>Some galaxies in a JWST image <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09436">of another cluster</a> may hearken <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09434">from an even earlier time</a>, as early as 300 million years after the Big Bang, two research teams report in a pair of papers submitted to arXiv.org on July 19. One of those galaxies seems to have already built up a spiral disk about a billion times the mass of the sun, which is surprisingly mature for such an early galaxy.</p>



<p>And a tally of galaxies seen in the SMACS 0723 image suggests that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09428">galaxies with mature disks</a>, rather than disorganized blobs or ones made up mostly of dark matter, may have been more common in the very early universe than previously thought, another team reports in an arXiv.org paper submitted July 19. That means those early disks might not be outliers.</p>



<p>“Definitely these galaxies are a big deal, but it remains to be seen how exciting they will look in the context of a few months’ progress with JWST,” Carnall says. The best is yet to come.</p>

<p><strong>What did in the dinosaurs: Warm blood or soft eggs?</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/what-did-dinosaurs-warm-blood-or-soft-eggs"><em>Science News</em></a>, July 22, 1972</p>



<p>Dinosaurs might have been endothermic, or warm-blooded…. The combination of large size, endothermy and naked skin may explain the extinction of dinosaurs. About 65 million years ago there was a sharp drop in temperature…. Dinosaurs, lacking skin insulation and too large to burrow underground … could not survive. Meanwhile, evidence has come that … the shells [of their eggs] became progressively thinner … too fragile to support the growing embryo.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinos-straddled-line-between-cold-and-warm-blooded">dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded</a> and some could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-discoveries-suggest-earliest-dinosaurs-laid-soft-shelled-eggs">laid soft-shelled eggs</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/14, p. 6</em>). But neither trait led to the reptiles’ demise. In the late 1970s, geologists proposed that an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/closing-killer">asteroid strike triggered a mass extinction</a> (<em>1/25/92, p. 56</em>), killing more than 75 percent of life on Earth. That theory is now widely accepted. Scientists have even found the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">killer’s calling card: a crater about 180 kilometers wide</a> on the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-ancestors-inner-ears-warm-blooded-fossil">Mammal ancestors’ shrinking inner ears may reveal when warm-bloodedness arose</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hot or not? Peeking inside an animal’s ear — even a fossilized one — may tell you whether it was warm- or cold-blooded. Using a novel method that analyzes the size and shape of the inner ear canals, researchers suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04963-z">mammal ancestors abruptly became warm-blooded</a> about 233 million years ago, the team reports in <em>Nature</em> July 20.</p>



<p>Warm-bloodedness, or endothermy, isn’t unique to mammals — birds, the only living dinosaurs, are warm-blooded, too. But endothermy is one of mammals’ key features, allowing the animals to regulate their internal body temperatures by controlling their metabolic rates. This feature allowed mammals to occupy environmental niches from pole to equator, and to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-world-evolution-innovation-dinosaurs-paleontology">weather the instability of ancient climates</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/22</em>).</p>





<p>When endothermy evolved, however, has been a mystery. Based on fossil analyses of growth rates and oxygen isotopes in bones, researchers have proposed dates for its emergence as far back as 300 million years ago.</p>



<p>The inner ear structures of mammals and their ancestors hold the key to solving that mystery, says Ricardo Araújo, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Lisbon. In all vertebrates, the labyrinth of semicircular canals in the inner ear contains a fluid that responds to head movements, brushing against tiny hair cells in the ear and helping to maintain a sense of balance. That fluid can become thicker or thinner depending on body temperature.</p>



<p>“Mammals have very unique inner ears,” Araújo says. Compared with cold-blooded vertebrates of similar size, the dimensions of mammals’ semicircular canals — such as thickness, length and radius of curvature — is particularly small, he says. “The ducts are very thin and tend to be very circular compared with other animals.” By contrast, fish have the largest for their body size.</p>



<p>What if, Araújo and his colleagues hypothesized, the size and shape of the ear canals are related to the animal’s body temperature? In warm-blooded animals, the fluid becomes less viscous, and the canals may have shrunk to compensate. If so, it might be possible to trace how the shape of fossilized inner ear canals changed over time to discover when warm-bloodedness emerged in the mammal lineage.</p>



<p>To test that hypothesis, the researchers created a tool they call the “thermo-motility index” to link warm-bloodedness to those inner ear dimensions in 341 different vertebrates. Accounting for size differences, the value of this index turned out to closely track an animal’s body temperature, from fish to reptiles to mammals. Reptiles had low index values; mammals were high.</p>



<p>The team then applied this index to the fossilized ear canals of 56 extinct mammal ancestor species. To their surprise, the data showed a sharp change in inner ear morphology around 233 million years ago. That would correspond to an increase in body temperature of between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius — suggesting that endothermy evolved abruptly around that time, the team concludes.</p>

<h3>Heating up</h3>



<p>The inner ears of warm-blooded mammal ancestors called mammaliamorphs (illustrated, left) that lived in the Late Triassic Period had smaller, more tightly curved inner ear canals compared with earlier cold-blooded synapsids (right), which lived during the Permian Period. Analyses of the ear canal dimensions of mammal ancestors suggests warm-bloodedness emerged abruptly in the mammal lineage around 233 million years ago.</p>

<p>“The fact that it is a sharp break in the data [suggests] the transition happened rapidly, within about a million years,” says coauthor Kenneth Angielczyk, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clever study, says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work. “I’ve been using [computed tomography] data to study the shapes of inner ears for years, to try to infer how extinct species moved and how they could hear, and it never occurred to me that inner ear shape is related to metabolism and could be used to predict body temperatures of fossil species.”</p>



<p>However, Brusatte notes that there is a limit to what scientists can glean from fossilized ear canals alone, as they don’t reveal what soft tissues may have been present, such as the hair cells, or the actual viscosity of the ear fluid. “Shape alone may not always be sufficient to predict something as complex as body temperature or metabolic style.”</p>



<p>The timing of the purported shift, about 233 million years ago, corresponds to a geologically brief interlude of highly unstable climate known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">Carnian Pluvial Episode</a> (<em>SN: 9/30/21</em>). “It was a time when global temperatures were changing a lot, and it was also a very wet, humid time,” Angielczyk says. “One of the benefits of endothermy is that it stabilizes the internal body environment, lets you operate independent of environmental conditions.”</p>



<p>The finding highlights how “the whole Triassic was a bit insane,” Araújo says. The start of the Triassic was epically hot, coming on the heels of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">“Great Dying” mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian Period (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>). Vertebrate species had just begun to recover from that event when they were hit with the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Yet the Triassic also saw the dawn of both mammals and dinosaurs — both of which managed to survive.</p>



<p>It was “a crucial time period in the history of life,” Araújo says. All of that instability may have armed both groups with the evolutionary tools they needed to weather <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-triassic-mass-extinction-volcano-survival">yet another mass extinction at the end of the Triassic</a> 201 million years ago (<em>SN: 7/1/22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-tears-disease-particles-technology">A new technology uses human teardrops to spot disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human tears could carry a flood of useful information.</p>



<p>With just a few drops, a new technique <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c02531">can spot eye disease and even glimpse signs of diabetes</a>, scientists report July 20 in <em>ACS Nano</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We wanted to demonstrate the potential of using tears to detect disease,” says Fei Liu, a biomedical engineer at Wenzhou Medical University in China. It’s possible the droplets could open a window for scientists to peer into the entire body, he says, and one day even let people quickly test their tears at home.</p>





<p>Like saliva and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/test-could-warn-problems-kidney-transplant-recipients">urine</a>, tears contain tiny sacs stuffed with cellular messages (<em>SN: 9/3/13</em>). If scientists could intercept these microscopic mailbags, they could offer new intel on what’s happening inside the body. But collecting enough of these sacs, called exosomes, is tricky. Unlike fluid from other body parts, just a trickle of liquid leaks from the eyes.</p>



<p>So Liu’s team devised a new way to capture the sacs from tiny volumes of tears. First, the researchers collected tears from study participants. Then, the team added a solution containing the tears to a device with two nanoporous membranes, vibrated the membranes and sucked the solution through. Within minutes, the technique lets small molecules escape, leaving the sacs behind for analysis.</p>



<p>The results gave scientists an eyeful. Different types of dry-eye disease shed their own molecular fingerprints in people’s tears, the team found. What’s more, tears could potentially help doctors monitor how a patient’s diabetes is progressing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the scientists want to tap tears for evidence of other diseases as well as depression or emotional stress, says study coauthor Luke Lee, a bioengineer at Harvard Medical School. “This is just the beginning,” he says. “Tears express something that we haven’t really&nbsp;explored.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-smell-new-nose-brain-connection">Dogs are great sniffers. A newfound nose-to-brain connection helps explain why</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dog’s brain is wired for smell. Now, a new map shows just how extensive that wiring is.</p>



<p>Powerful nerve connections <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2022/07/06/JNEUROSCI.2355-21.2022">link the dog nose to wide swaths of the brain</a>, researchers report July 11 in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>. One of these canine connections, a hefty link between areas that handle smell and vision, hasn’t been seen before in any species, including humans.<br><br>The results offer a first-of-its-kind anatomical description of how dogs “see” the world with their noses. The new brain map is “awesome, foundational work,” says Eileen Jenkins, a retired army veterinarian and expert on working dogs. “To say that they have all these same connections that we have in humans, and then some more, it’s going to revolutionize how we understand cognition in dogs.”</p>





<p>In some ways, the results aren’t surprising, says Pip Johnson, a veterinary radiologist and neuroimaging expert at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Dogs are superb sniffers. Their noses hold between 200 million and 1 billion odor molecule sensors, compared with the 5 million receptors estimated to dwell in a human nose. And dogs’ olfactory bulbs can be up to 30 times larger than people’s. But Johnson wanted to know how smell information wafts to brain regions beyond the obvious sniffing equipment.</p>



<p>To build the map, Johnson and colleagues performed MRI scans on 20 mixed-breed dogs and three beagles. The subjects all had long noses and medium heads, and were all probably decent sniffers. Researchers then identified tracts of white matter fibers that carry signals between brain regions. A method called diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the movement of water molecules along tissue, revealed the underlying tracts, which Johnson likens to the brain’s “road network.”</p>



<p>After odor information enters the nose, it whizzes to the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that sits behind the dogs’ eyes. But from there, it wasn’t clear where the signals went next. &nbsp;When Johnson looked for the tracts in the dog MRI data, she was blown away. “I just kept finding these huge pathways,” she says. “They seem like information freeways running from the nose back into the brain.”</p>

<h3>Sniff system</h3>



<p>In the dog brain, sturdy neural tracts run from the olfactory bulb (bottom left) to five distinct spots. A newfound connection (orange) links the olfactory system to vision, something that has so far been found only in dogs. The others lead to the cortical spinal tract (turquoise path), which helps trigger instinctual behaviors; the piriform lobe (green path), which may play a role in odor perception; the limbic system (blue path), which is involved with behavior and emotion; and the entorhinal cortex (pink path), which helps handle memory.</p>

<p>This new dog brain map contains some familiar roads, including those that connect the olfactory bulb to brain areas associated with memories and emotions. In people, those roads explain why a whiff of perfume can transport a person back in time.</p>



<p>But one tract was totally new. This road, thick and obvious, connected the olfactory bulb to the occipital lobe, the part of the dog brain that handles vision. “There have been lots of people who theorized that this connection existed, based on the behavior of trained dogs and detection dogs,” says Jenkins, who currently practices at Huntsville Veterinary Specialists &amp; Emergency in Alabama and who was not involved in this study. “But nobody has been able to prove it. This is fabulous.”</p>



<p>Dogs use all their senses to evaluate their environment. But this newfound connection between smell and sight suggests that the two are intricately linked. Perhaps this anatomical link could be why smell can often compensate when a dog’s sight goes, Johnson says. “Blind dogs can still play fetch.”</p>



<p>Breeding can affect the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dogs-breed-brain-shape-humans">shapes of dog brains</a>, neuroscientist Erin Hecht of Harvard University and colleagues have found (<em>SN: 9/2/19</em>). It would be interesting to see how these olfactory tracts look in different dog breeds, including scent hounds bred and trained for jobs such as hunting, finding disaster survivors or identifying diseases like cancer or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-dog-detection-pcr-test-screening-coronavirus">COVID-19</a>, Hecht says (<em>SN: 6/1/22</em>). “This study lays a foundation for future work,” she says.</p>



<p>Johnson and her colleagues aim to explore olfactory tracts of other animals. “I have actually had a play with some cat data,” she says. “Cats have the most amazing olfactory system too, and probably more connections than the dog that I can see.” But dog people, settle down. “That’s only preliminary data,” she quickly adds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/subsocial-behavior-among-delena-huntsman-spiders">These huntsman spiders do something weird: live together as a big, happy family</a></h4>

              
                <p>How descendants of cannibals evolved abilities to share a home mostly without killing each other — never mind the rare oopsie snack — resonates after several pandemic years.</p>



<p>Among the many kinds of velvety <em>Delena </em>huntsman spiders, four species from Australia show what for their kind is a downright freaky tolerance between a mom and her live-in offspring. “Cannibalism might happen occasionally, but with <em>Delena cancerides</em>, it&#8217;s almost never,” says behavioral ecologist Linda Rayor of Cornell University, who has studied them in the wild and in her lab for 20 years.</p>





<p>Not eating their own kind isn’t really the oddity here: Cannibalism varies a lot among spider species, Rayor says, but overall, it’s mostly a move of solitary kinds of spiders if they meet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">outside of flirting</a> or baby-guarding demands (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>A small number of <em>Delena</em> species, however, generally tolerate their own kind. The only exception Rayor sees in <em>D. cancerides</em> are a wild-caught female’s takedown of a full-grown male still in her cage after she lays eggs. “Wild-caught females are very intolerant of males who stick around too long,” she says.</p>



<p>What’s really strange, at least in the arachnid world, is these spiders’ shared family life. Out of the more than 50,000-plus known spider species, biologists classify fewer than 80 as truly social. In the most complex, hundreds or even thousands of females spin a great airy silken city, where some stay their entire lives. However, Rayor says, “my huntsman don’t do that.”</p>



<p>Some other biologists wouldn’t consider the <em>Delena</em> spiders Rayor studies as fully social — no spun-silk Sydney. Yet these spiders are not truly solitary either. A female doesn’t spin a web but shelters in a crevice, perhaps behind peeling bark on an acacia tree or under a slab of rock. These crevice-dwellers’ bodies look unusually flattened in profile: “a credit-card spider,” one scientist called the species, with some poetic license.</p>



<p>When a female triumphs in finding real estate, the kids can linger for months in her splendid mom cave — the kids with no sex life yet, that is. Never mind that older offspring already go out hunting on their own at night, or that often one or two later clutches of little ones hatch before the older ones leave. Spider moms guarding poppyseed-tiny hatchlings are common. Living with capable, nearly grown offspring, is strange in the arachnid world.</p>

Rayor</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most sociable of these sort-of tolerant moms, <em>D. cancerides</em>, lets a cohort of youngsters hang around the home for about a year after hatching. That’s a good portion of life for spiders that live only two and a half years. One of the reasons for doing so may sound familiar: Suitable housing can be hard to find.</p>



<p>Rayor once thought hanging with mom was an Australian thing, but she has now learned about tolerant moms from Madagascar in a <em>Damastes</em> species. To study the evolution of traits that add up to family life in the five species, Jacob Gorneau, now at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, and his Cornell colleagues used four genes from spiders in 37 huntsman genera to create the most ambitious genealogical tree yet of the family. Then Rayor turned to her decades of data to see what behaviors appeared on branches leading to lingering kids.</p>



<p>For instance, a form of egg sac called “plastered” — not drunk but spun like a firmly anchored splat on a surface of spider retreats — shows up in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790322001439">branches with the family-tolerant behavior</a>, the researchers report in the September issue of <em>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Spiders spin various shapes of outer sacs that discourage egg raiders. Spiders in a fixed retreat can conveniently anchor a sac, unlike some other moms that carry eggs with them. Also the more spread-out, plastered form might — Rayor emphasizes this is speculation — fit better in tight crevices than the puffier throw-pillow styles of egg sacs would.</p>



<p><em>Delena</em> spiderlings still carry abundant egg yolk with them when they clamber out of the egg sac. They don’t eat until after their first molt. “They’ve got these big, fat, green abdomens,” Rayor says. “They don’t have long legs, so they waddle.”</p>



<p>Once they molt, one benefit of this family lifestyle could be table scraps for the littles. Very young spiderlings are “ridiculously small,” Rayor says, and can handle food only about the size of a fruit fly. The chance to sneak extra shreds of meat from an older sib could greatly boost nutrition. Older sibs probably would rather not share, but Rayor sees “tolerated theft.”</p>



<p>Cute babies may not matter to a spider mom, but maybe they should to humans. Gorneau, once “very afraid of spiders,” wants to fight the stereotype of spiders as aggressive dangers. Rayor’s spiders strike him as “stoic,” mostly sitting quietly. Rayor’s lab full of spiders in their homes, he now finds, is a “calming environment.”</p>

                <p>On a sunny day at Zoo Atlanta in 2020, Kelly the African bush elephant reached for a snack and revealed something strange.</p>



<p>High-speed cameras tracking her movements suggested that the skin on top of Kelly’s trunk stretched more than the skin underneath. “But that didn’t make any sense,” says Andrew Schulz, a mechanical engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>Scientists had assumed that elephant trunk skin largely stretches the same way all over. When Schulz sent data from Kelly and a male elephant, Msholo, to colleagues, they said, “Oh yeah, your data is wrong,” he remembers.</p>





<p>Follow-up experiments stretching pieces of elephant skin in the lab showed the same peculiar phenomenon: The skin on the top and bottom of the trunk are two entirely different beasts. “Talk about a great day as a scientist!” Schulz says. “That’s when we really started to believe that what we were saying was true.”</p>



<p>The tough upper skin of an elephant’s trunk, which crumples into creases and crags like the folded furrows of a shar-pei puppy, is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122563119">about 15 percent stretchier</a> than the gently wrinkled skin on the underside, Schulz and his colleagues report July 18 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption>When an elephant elongates its trunk, the upper skin stretches more than the skin on the underside. Green crosses represent initial positions on the skin. As the trunk extends, the crosses turn red and move to the right, indicating how much the skin stretched.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That extra stretch probably helps elephants reach down and wrap their trunks around a log or a tree branch, while the wrinkled skin underneath gives the animals a good grip, Schulz says.</p>



<p>The team also observed that the trunk extends like a telescope, the tip reaching out first, followed by sections farther up. And at the trunk tip, it’s the skin that does most of the straining, not the muscle, mathematical modeling experiments suggest.</p>



<p>Scientists have long studied the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/muscular-machinery-tentacles-trunks-and-tongues">muscles in elephant trunks</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/88</em>). But skin has largely been overlooked, says Lucia Beccai, a soft roboticist at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa who wasn’t involved in the research. The new study “tells us that the structure of elephant skin is not all the same.”</p>



<p>Artificial skin is often modeled after human skin, but researchers could learn a lot from other animals, Beccai says. Understanding how Kelly’s and Msholo’s folds and wrinkles stretch is “surely information that will improve the design of soft robots,” she says.</p>
