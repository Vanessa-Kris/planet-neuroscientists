<p>Over the past decade, neuroimaging studies have provided new insights into how psychoactive drugs alter the brain’s activity. Psilocybin – the active ingredient in magic mushrooms – has been found to <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/182410/magic-mushrooms-reset-brains-depressed-patients/">reduce activity in brain regions involved in depression</a>, for example, while MDMA seems to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345398">augment brain activity for positive memories</a>.</p>
<p>Now a new study sheds some light into what’s going in the brain when people smoke cannabis – and it turns out that the effects can be quite different depending on the specific strain of the drug. The research, published recently in the <i>Journal of Psychopharmacology</i>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119841568?journalCode=jopa">suggests that cannabis disrupts particular brain networks</a> – but some strains can buffer against this disruption.</p>
<p><span id="more-37028"></span></p>
<p>Cannabis contains two major active ingredients: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is responsible for many of the drug’s psychoactive effects, such as the feeling of being stoned and the anxiety that people sometimes feel, as well as feelings of euphoria. High-THC strains of cannabis – known as skunk – are commonly consumed, with modern strains often having little CBD content, say the authors, and this has been <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext">suggested</a> to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>put smokers at higher risk of developing psychosis. CBD, which is present at varying levels in other recreational strains of cannabis, doesn’t produce intoxication but may reduce anxiety and psychotic symptoms, suggesting it could block potentially harmful effects of THC.</p>
<p>However, few neuroimaging studies have examined how brain activity is influenced by different concentrations of these two ingredients. So Matthew Wall and colleagues decided to look at the neural effects of two strains of cannabis: one high in THC but with no CBD, and the other with high levels of both compounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team recruited 17 participants who used cannabis fairly regularly but not heavily. All participants completed three sessions; in each session they were given one of the two strains of cannabis, or a placebo that didn’t contain either compound but still smelled like the drug. Half an hour after inhaling the vaporised drug, the participants had an MRI scan to measure their resting brain activity. After the scan they rated the intensity of the drug’s effects, scoring themselves on measures such as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>such as how anxious they were or how dry their mouth was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers then looked at patterns of connectivity within brain networks while participants were on the different drugs. They were particularly interested in the default mode network (DMN), which is active when we’re just resting and/or thinking about ourselves, and the salience network, which is involved in switching between this kind of internally-focused state and engaging with the outside world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team found that when participants smoked either strain of cannabis, the functional connectivity within their DMN was disrupted compared to when they smoked the placebo. But the pattern of disruption was strikingly different depending on the strain. Most prominently, the THC-only strain disrupted connectivity within an area of the DMN called the posterior cingulate cortex, and the amount of disruption in this area was directly related to participants’ ratings of the intensity of the drug’s effects. When participants took the strain that also contained CBD, disruption in this brain area disappeared, suggesting that CBD was blocking this effect. Differences between the two strains were also apparent in the salience network, where the THC-only strain similarly caused much more widespread disruption than the CBD strain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results suggest that CBD may act as a “buffer” against some of the neurological effects of THC, the researchers say, particularly those in the posterior cingulate cortex that are related to feelings of intoxication. This region also contains a high density of the receptors which THC acts upon, and other research has found that long-term use of cannabis can reduce the number of these receptors. This suggests that disruption in the posterior cingulate cortex could be related to the development of harmful long-term effects of the drug like psychosis and dependence – and that strains of cannabis that include CBD may be able to protect against these damaging effects.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that further evidence is needed for this theory – and it will also be important to study the effects of the strains in other populations. In this study, the researchers examined only semi-regular users who had never experienced any problems with drug-taking. The effects of cannabis in the brain could be very different in this group compared to those who have never taken the drug – or those who have had negative experiences with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, understanding that not all strains of cannabis are created equal is important in a time where the drug is becoming more widely accepted, the authors say. “As cannabis transitions to legal/decriminalized status in many jurisdictions, understanding the neural effects of different strains of cannabis (with different levels of THC and CBD) is now a priority for public health,” they write.</p>

<p>Cesarean section is a common surgery that, like most surgical procedures, can cause stress and anxiety in patients. Stress and anxiety in women undergoing cesarean section is especially concerning due to negative effects on post-operative recovery, lactation, and newborn development. More non-pharmacological treatments are needed to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Music has long been considered to have stress-reducing effects, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615601696" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">numerous trials have shown</a> that playing music during the surgical process reduces pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Although there have been a few studies on music during cesarean section, there is no strong evidence of an effect on validated or objective measures of stress and anxiety of patients. Therefore, Hepp <em>et al.</em> carried out a randomized controlled trial to examine if music during cesarean section reduces both validated patient-reported and objective measures of stress and anxiety.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11015 alignleft" height="150" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/music-300x150.png" width="300" />
<p>Three hundred and four patients were randomized to hear music from their choice of genre or no music during standard cesarean surgery. Both groups had high self-reported anxiety before the start of the procedure, but the group that heard music reported a significantly greater reduction in anxiety at the end of the procedure. Measurement of a stress hormone at the end of the procedure showed that stress sensation during surgery was significantly lower in the group that heard music.</p>
<p>Together, these results show that playing music during surgery is a relatively easy way to reduce stress and anxiety in new mothers giving birth by cesarean surgery.</p>

<p>Previous studies have suggested that the use of medical interventions during labor and birth has slowly increased over the course of the last two decades in over 20 developed countries.  Although medical interventions can be beneficial to mothers and their newborns, they do pose additional risks.  As such, new policies and reforms have been implemented internationally in favor of normal birth, which is defined as an unassisted vaginal birth without labor induction, epidural, anesthesia, or episiotomy.  Despite the increased interest in facilitating normal birth, few studies have assessed the factors that inhibit it. This study aimed to evaluate both the modifiable and non-modifiable factors influencing the outcome of normal birth.</p>
<p>The authors, Prosser <em>et al.</em>, obtained data from the Having a Baby in Queensland Survey. The original survey included all women who gave birth between 2011 and 2012 in Queensland, Australia and evaluated women’s maternity care experiences. From this data, the authors determined that the non-modifiable factors that reduced the likelihood of normal birth included gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, previous cesarean section, the number of previous births, age, and later-term pregnancies. The leading modifiable factors that contributed to increased rates of normal birth included continuity of care through labor, freedom of movement, and a non-supine position.</p>
<p>The authors also assessed the model of care and found that midwifery-led care (both public and private), GP shared care and standard public care resulted in the highest rates of normal birth while private obstetrics care resulted in the lowest rates of normal birth within the study sample.  Interestingly, these results also account for both obstetric and social risk factors, leading the authors to argue that these disparities might be a result of the philosophical differences between the two models of perinatal care.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors concluded that treatment and care practices can influence normal birth outcomes and normal birth may increase with the appropriate facilitation.</p>

<p>It is well known that “breast is best” and that breastfeeding is beneficial to both mothers and infants, with increased duration of breastfeeding providing increased benefits. However, many women face challenges in initiation and/or continuation of breastfeeding for a wide variety of reasons. One group that has been shown to have a lower rate and duration of breastfeeding is mothers with obesity.  These women may face barriers which include complications during delivery delaying the initiation of breastfeeding, physical discomfort, and reduced body confidence.</p>
<p>Ing-Marie Claesson and colleagues conducted a qualitative study focusing on 11 obese breastfeeding women in Sweden in order to understand their points of view, which is crucial to developing effective ways to support these women. Although some women had reservations, most intended to breastfeed, viewing it as an integral and natural part of motherhood.</p>
<p>The participants identified three categories of challenges. First, there were difficulties in finding a position that worked both for their own bodily comfort and their infant’s ability to nurse. Some women felt that infants had more difficulty nursing from their larger breasts. Second, the need to expose at least some part of their bodies in order to breastfeed discouraged some of the women, especially from breastfeeding in public. This was linked to low overall self-esteem, which was affected by being obese. Lastly, the unexpected difficulties in breastfeeding led to frustration and disappointment, which in some cases led to giving up.</p>
<p>The women also discussed the support they did or did not receive from healthcare providers. Some participants felt that the focus on the infant’s weight gain led to a pressure to switch to formula. Other participants recalled that support from healthcare providers who did not focus on their obesity increased their confidence and strengthened them as breastfeeding mothers. These experiences highlight the need for individualized support that helps women with obesity overcome the practical difficulties of breastfeeding without the focus being on the mother’s weight.</p>

<p>Eating disorders (EDs) can affect up to eight percent of pregnant women and are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.  Pregnant women suffering from Anorexia Nervosa face risks such as premature birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight, while pregnant women suffering from Binge Eating disorder face increased risk for delivering a baby with a higher birth weight. Due to these risks, early identification of EDs is necessary for tailoring antenatal care needs.  In this study, the obstacles of disclosing and identifying EDs were evaluated from the perspective of both pregnant women and health care professionals.</p>
<p>Bye <em>et al.</em>, found that although women reported an overall reduction in eating disorder symptoms during pregnancy, over half of the participants experienced some symptoms, most commonly binge eating and restricting calories.  Despite these symptoms, only 26% disclosed to a health care professional.  The authors then developed five themes based on interviews conducted with women who did not disclose their symptoms:  stigma, lack of opportunity, preference for self-management, current ED symptomatology, and illness awareness.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10200 alignright" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Eating-Disorders-Pregnancy-1-300x169.png" width="300" />
<p>After surveying pregnant women, Bye <em>et al. </em>conducted a focus group with healthcare students and professionals, including both midwives and health visitors.  Many of the healthcare providers felt that they lacked adequate knowledge on EDs in pregnancy because it wasn’t included in their training at all or training was limited.  Some also thought that this contributed to the lack of knowledge of the relevant policies and management guidelines for EDs.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the leading factor inhibiting disclosure amongst pregnant women was stigma.  Similarly, healthcare students and professionals felt they were ill-equipped to help those they had suspected might have an ED.  As a result, the authors argue that improvements in eating disorder education is needed amongst prenatal healthcare providers to give them more confidence in the identification of eating disorders, decrease stigma, and lead to better guidelines for how to address the disorder.  See <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/05/22/better-training-could-help-health-professionals-identify-and-support-pregnant-women-with-eating-disorders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our blog post by the authors of this study</a> where they discuss specific activities that could raise both professional and public awareness about eating disorders in order to improve pregnancy outcomes and patient experiences.</p>

<p>Your personality traits play an important part in how long you are likely to live, as much as, or even more than, other personal factors like your intelligence and your family’s economic background. Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618302502">a study</a> in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em> has identified a key factor that mediates the personality-mortality link – sleep. Simply put, people with certain personality characteristics are more likely to sleep too little, or too much, or to experience greater sleepiness during the day, and in turn this raises their year-on-year risk of dying (too little or excess sleep, and poor quality sleep, have known links with various health risks, such as cardiovascular disease, depression and chronic inflammation).</p>
<p>“Sleep has been associated with both personality and longevity, yet [before now] no study has investigated whether sleep is a pathway linking personality to objective health outcomes,” say the researchers, led by Shantel Spears at West Virginia University.</p>
<p><span id="more-37011"></span></p>
<p>The researchers used data collected from thousands of participants as part of the long-running National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, including information on their personality traits recorded in 1995-1996, and information on their sleep duration and sleep quality collected in 2004-2006. Nearly 4000 participants provided data at both these time points, and the researchers then used national records to see which of them had died and when, up to October, 2015.</p>
<p>As expected, based on the known importance of sleep to health, the research showed that too little or too much sleep was associated with increased risk of dying – approximately 65 minutes more than, or under, the average nightly sleep duration (7 hours in this sample) was associated with a 10 per cent increased risk of dying over the course of the study.</p>
<p>Turning to personality, and consistent with many prior studies, participants who scored lower on trait conscientiousness were more likely to die before the end of the research period, and Spears’ team established that this was explained in part by these people getting less sleep, on average, and feeling less rested during the day (a mark of poorer sleep quality). Although the study didn’t look into why exactly people low in conscientiousness were getting less sleep, one can imagine they engage in more <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/01/psychologists-investigate-a-major-ignored-reason-for-our-lack-of-sleep-bedtime-procrastination/">bedtime procrastination</a>, and generally struggle to establish <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/21/episode-11-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep/">a healthy bedtime routine</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, high scorers on trait neuroticism were indirectly at greater risk of dying because of their lower and higher than average amounts of sleep, and their on-average greater feelings of fatigue in the daytime. Again, one can speculate that these folk, who have lower moods and more worry, might struggle to get to sleep or to get up promptly in the morning.</p>
<p>Lower scores on extraversion were indirectly linked with increased risk of death, thanks to an association with greater daytime feelings of fatigue (perhaps extraverts’ greater daytime activity levels makes it easier for them to get a satisfying night’s sleep, but this is speculation). Most surprising – given prior research findings have not identified this trait as being relevant to sleep – was the indirect link between higher trait agreeableness and risk of dying, explained by these people having less sleep and more daytime fatigue; it’s not clear why this might be.</p>
<p>Previous research had already established that personality predicts longevity because of its association with various health behaviours, such as more conscientious people being less likely to smoke, or drink and eat to excess. However, much of the personality-linked variance in risk of dying has remained unexplained, and this study now identifies too little or too much sleep (and feeling insufficiently rested during the day) as other important factors. “Our findings suggest that short and long sleep duration and daytime dysfunction may be important pathways linking aspects of personality to reduced life expectancy,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The research has some important limitations including the participants being mostly white and highly educated; the reliance on a short self-report test of personality; and the subjective measure of sleep being based on time spent in bed rather being asleep per se. Nonetheless, if the results can be replicated, they raise some important implications for public health, suggesting that personality screening could be used to identify those people – especially high scorers in neuroticism and low scorers in conscientiousness – most likely to benefit from interventions aimed at improving sleep. “Alternatively,” the researchers said, “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/">changing these aspects of personality</a> could improve sleep for these individuals, enhancing their health and longevity”.</p>

This calls for a celebration! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last May, we began offering authors the choice of having PLOS post their manuscript to the preprint server, bioRxiv, when they submitted to a PLOS journal*. Our opt-in service has made it easier for authors to post their work early and has encouraged many authors to try preprinting their research for the first time. As of today, we’ve posted more than 2,500 preprints! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our authors have now seen their work go from preprint to published and it’s amazing to see the transformation their work has taken – just take a look at the examples below.</span></p>

<p><strong>Why we preprint</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an author, an editor, or just an avid science reader, preprints offer a lot of </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advantages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for how we share and consume information: they allow research to be shared openly and broadly, spark feedback and collaborations that may not have happened otherwise, enable authors to claim results and demonstrate their work for timely opportunities such as grant proposals and promotions. But if you really want to know how preprints advance science, just ask our authors:</span></p>

<i>“As statisticians, we provide analysis and data visualization methods for scientists in the field. Sharing code through GitHub and preprints through bioRxiv provides researchers with the latest methodologies as early as possible. The other benefit is that the scientific community can provide researchers with useful feedback prior to publication. This means that we can tailor new methods to scientists’ needs. These interactions were very enriching, and I recommend Open Science to everybody.”</i></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>During major bouts of anger or fear, people can end up taking extreme and sometimes violent actions. But they often say that, in the moment, they didn’t feel responsible for those actions – they “lost control” or “saw red”. In the UK, under certain circumstances, a person accused of murder can even claim that this “loss of control” led to them killing their victim. If successful, this defence can reduce charges to manslaughter.</p>
<p>Now the first study of its kind suggests that there is some truth to these claims. Participants put into a fearful or angry state really do seem to have a reduced sense of agency, according to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-018-5461-6">paper published recently in <i>Experimental Brain Research</i></a>, raising questions about the accountability of people going through extreme emotions.</p>
<p><span id="more-36996"></span></p>
<p>Julia Christensen and colleagues at University College London assessed participants’ sense of agency while they were in different emotional states. To do this, they used a measure of a perceptual distortion known as “intentional binding”. Intentional binding refers to the fact that we perceive <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/05/physical-effort-fuels-a-feeling-of-ownership-over-our-movements/">our deliberate physical actions as occurring closer in time to their sensory consequences than was really the case</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the standard task demonstrating this effect, participants press a button while watching a clock hand which is constantly rotating. They have to say what time was indicated by the clock hand when they pressed the button. On some trials, pressing the button triggers a noise a fraction of a second later, while on other trials pressing the button doesn’t have any consequence. For the trials in which there is a noise, intentional binding means that people tend to say that they pressed the button later than they really did (and later than in the silent trials), closer in time to the noise. Crucially for current purposes, intentional binding only occurs for deliberate, voluntary actions, and in fact a larger intentional binding effect is usually taken by researchers as evidence that a participant feels more in control of her or his actions.</p>
<p>The new study used this standard intentional binding task – but with a twist. During the task, the researchers also induced feelings of fear or anger in their participants. For the fear condition, participants saw the word “Threat!” on screen during some trials, which signalled that they might receive a painful electric shock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the anger condition, participants sometimes performed an additional task where they had to respond to a sound by pressing a button as quickly as possible in order to avoid losing money. To enrage the participants, the researchers made this task impossible to win: the participants were always told they were too slow and received the financial penalty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across three experiments – two that induced fear and one anger – the researchers found that participants had reduced intentional binding when they were in an emotional state. That is, for the fear and anger trials, participants’ perception of when they pressed the button shifted less towards the timing of the noise compared to neutral trials.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results suggest that the participants had a reduced sense of agency over their button-pressing when they felt fear and anger. This provides some of the first evidence that going through extreme negative emotions can in fact make people feel less in control, as has often been assumed. And the fact that this effect was found using an implicit measure of agency, rather than by simply asking participants whether they felt in control, suggests that it may be happening at a fairly fundamental level.</p>
<p>But there are limitations to the study: most noticeably that there was no condition in which the researchers induced a positive emotion like happiness. It could be that strong emotional states generally reduce people’s sense of agency, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. And one of the two fear experiments did not actually produce a significant result but was only reported as a trend, so it remains to be seen whether the results will be replicated in another sample.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While the research provides some scientific rationale for the “loss of control” defence, there are still much broader ethical and legal questions. Even if extreme negative emotional states do leave people with a reduced sense of control over their actions, for example, that doesn’t necessarily imply that they should be absolved of any sins they commit. “The fact that sense of agency is reduced by negative emotional states does not demonstrate total lack of responsibility, nor condone any specific action,” the authors write. “<i>Feeling</i> less responsible does not necessarily <i>make</i> one actually less responsible.”</p>

Although this finding has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-016-9421-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replicated</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often</a> and in various settings, many questions still remain unanswered.</p>
<p>We need to understand the causal mechanisms behind the longer survival among parents, and during what point in life this survival advantage arises. Are mothers and fathers less likely to develop diseases? Or does the advantage arise because they survive longer once a disease occurs?</p>
<h3><strong>How we answered these questions</strong></h3>
<p>In our <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1134-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently published study</a>, we took a closer look at the relationship between parenthood and health in old age. We did not only focus on mortality in general; we also examined the risk of a first hospital admission, the risk of being readmitted to hospital, and survival after hospitalization among the entire Swedish population over the age of 70 (in total 890,544 men and women). We studied how these four different outcomes were associated with the number of children per individual and with their offspring’s socioeconomic resources.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that two findings are particularly interesting. As expected, childless men and women had higher mortality than parents in our study, but they were not at higher risk of a first hospitalization. This suggests that the advantage of having children perhaps plays out once ill health occurs rather than before. Alternatively, parents might be more likely to seek help and receive early treatment, which itself might be one reason for their longer survival.</p>
<blockquote><p>In an era of population ageing and rising levels of childlessness, identifying care deficits could eventually contribute to reducing health disparities in old age.</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, we found children’s education, but not their income, to be associated with their parents’ health, more so than the number of children itself. The protective effects of higher offspring education were strong and consistent for all parental health outcomes in our study, regardless of parents’ own socioeconomic position.</p>
<p>The mortality differences between parents and non-parents should not be neglected. Holding other factors constant, we estimated that 61% of women with two children were expected to survive to age 87 (the end of our study period), while the corresponding number for childless women was 56%.</p>
<p>The difference was even larger between parents whose children had only compulsory education and parents with highly educated children: we found an increase from 57% of women expected to survive to age 87 in the former group to 66% in the latter, with a similar increase for men.</p>
<p>In another recently published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckz053/5443281?searchresult=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>, we estimated that married women with two children are expected to survive about 16 months longer after stroke compared to childless married women. Considering that the average survival time after stroke is just 7 years, this survival advantage is substantial.</p>
<p>Although several studies on the relationship between number of children, their socioeconomic resources, and health in late life have recently been published, most authors conclude that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953617302332" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">further</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39124-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-018-9469-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is</a> <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/71/5/424.long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">needed</a> to shed light on the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<h3><strong>What causes these differences?</strong></h3>
<p>People who eventually become parents might be healthier already from an early age. For instance, some people remain childless because of health problems in mid-life which could then affect mortality in old age. This would mean that having children indicates better overall health but does not contribute to it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, adult children often become caregivers for their ageing parents, even in a country like Sweden in which publicly financed health and elder care is universally available. Children might also provide emotional and informational support to their ageing parents. These forms of support may directly contribute to the better health and mortality outcomes for parents.</p>
<p>Either way, it is possible that childless adults would benefit from additional care and support in old age, regardless of the underlying causal pathways. In an era of population ageing and rising levels of childlessness, identifying such care deficits could eventually contribute to reducing health disparities in old age.</p>

<p>How do we acquire our native language? Are the basics of language and grammar innate, as nativists argue? Or, as empiricists propose, is language something we must learn entirely from scratch?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This debate has a long history. To get at an answer, it’s worth setting the theories aside and instead looking at just how much information <i>must </i>be learned in order to speak a language with adult proficiency, argue Francis Mollica at the University of Rochester, US, and Steven Piantadosi at the University of California, Berkeley. If the amount is vast, for instance, this could indicate that it’s impracticable for it all to be learned without sophisticated innate language mechanisms. In their <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181393">new paper</a>, published in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, Mollica and Piantadosi present results suggesting that some language-specific knowledge could be innate – but probably not the kind of syntactic knowledge (the grammatical rules underlying correct word order) that nativists have tended to argue in favour of. Indeed, their work suggests that the long-running focus on whether syntax is learned or innate has been misplaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36978"></span></p>
<p>Mollica and Piantadosi worked out “back-of-the-envelope” upper, lower and “best guess” estimates of how much information we have to absorb in order to acquire various aspects of language — to identify phonemes (units of sound), word-forms, and lexical semantics (the meaning of words and the relationships between them), as well as syntax, for example.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The maths that they used to do this is complex. (If you’re fond of equations that span a page-width, you should definitely check theirs out.) But their fundamental approach is to compute the number of “bits” required to specify an outcome<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— learning the meaning of a word, for example — “from a plausible space of logically possible alternatives”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Using this approach, they estimate that storing essential knowledge about phonemes takes up only about 750 bits (a bit is a binary unit of information used in computing; 8 million bits is equivalent to 1 megabyte). However, a typical adult vocabulary of about 40,000 words involves perhaps about 400,000 bits of lexical knowledge. Storing information about what all these words mean is more demanding: the researchers’ best guess is somewhere in the region of 12,000,000 bits. A language-learner would also need to store about 80,000 bits of information about word frequency, they suggest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, Mollica and Piantadosi turned to syntax. “Syntax has traditionally been the battleground for debates about how much information is built-in versus learned,” they write. “In the face of massively incompatible and experimentally under-determined syntactic theories, we aim here to study the question in a way that is as independent as possible.” In fact, they estimate that we need to store only a very small amount of data about syntax — perhaps only 667 bits. According to these estimates, having innate knowledge of syntax wouldn’t be especially helpful, as acquiring it is relatively undemanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Syntactic knowledge may not require a huge amount of knowledge but the total amount of language-related information that must be stored by a proficient language speaker is massive: around 1.5 megabytes. If correct, this would mean that up until the age of 18, a child would have to remember, on average, 1000 to 2000 bits of information every day. The researchers’ very lowest estimate is that reaching adult language proficiency would require that a child learn 120 bits per day.</p>
<blockquote><p>“To put our lower estimate in perspective, each day for 18 years a child must wake up and remember, perfectly and for the rest of their life, an amount of information equivalent to the information in this sequence:</p>
<p>011010000110100101100100011001000110010101101110011000010110001101100011</p>
<p>011011110111001001100100011010010110111101101110”</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a “remarkable feat of cognition” suggests that language acquisition is grounded in “remarkably sophisticated mechanisms for learning, memory and inference,” the pair comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These are ballpark-type figures, they stress. But, even so, they argue that their estimates suggest that neither the nativist nor the empiricist approach provides a viable account of how we come to represent lexical semantics (word meanings) – which their work indicates is overwhelmingly the biggest language mountain to conquer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Our results suggest that if any language-specific knowledge is innate, it is most likely for helping tackle the immense challenge of learning lexical semantics, rather than other domains with learnability problems that require orders of magnitude less information,” Mollica and Piantadosi<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>conclude.</p>

Consumers assume that when they take an over-the-counter pain medication, it will relieve their physical symptoms, but they do not anticipate broader psychological effects.”</blockquote><br />In the latest installment of this alarmist saga, we learn that acetaminophen blunts positive empathy, i.e. the capacity to appreciate and identify with the positive emotions of others (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00538/full" target="_blank">Mischkowski et al., 2019</a>). I'll discuss those findings another time. <br /><br />But now, let's evaluate the entire TYLENOL® oeuvre by taking a step back and examining the plausibility of the published claims. To summarize, one of the most common over-the-counter, non-narcotic, non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug" target="_blank" title="Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug">NSAID</a> pain-relieving medications in existence supposedly alleviates the personal experience of hurt feelings and social pain and heartache (positive outcomes). At the same time, TYLENOL® blunts the phenomenological experiences of positive emotion and diminishes empathy for others' people's experiences, both good and bad (negative outcomes). Published articles have reported that many of these effects can be observed after ONE REGULAR DOSE of paracetamol. These findings are based on how undergraduates judge a series of hypothetical stories. One major problem (which is not specific to The Paracetamol Papers) concerns the ecological validity of laboratory tasks as measures of the cognitive and emotional constructs of interest. This issue is critical, but outside the main scope of our discussion today. More to the point, an experimental manipulation may cause a statistically significant shift in a variable of interest, but ultimately we have to decide whether a circumscribed finding in the lab has broader implications for society at large. <br /><br /><br /><b>Why TYLENOL® ?</b><br /><br />Another puzzling element is, why choose acetaminophen as the exclusive pain medication of interest? Its mechanisms of action for relieving fever, headache, and other pains are unclear. Thus, the authors don't have a specific, principled reason for choosing TYLENOL® over Advil (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" target="_blank">ibuprofen</a>) or aspirin. Presumably, the effects should generalize, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For instance, ibuprofen actually <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/06/advil-increases-social-pain-if-youre.html">Increases Social Pain</a> in men.<br /><br />The analgesic effects of acetaminophen are mediated by a complex series of cellular mechanisms (<a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action" target="_blank">Mallet et al., 2017</a>). One proposed mechanism involves descending serotonergic bulbospinal pathways from the brainstem to the spinal cord. This isn't exactly Prozac territory, so the analogy between Tylenol and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor" target="_blank">SSRI antidepressants</a> isn't apt. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the Cav3.2 calcium channel might also be part of the action (<a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action" target="_blank">Mallet et al., 2017</a>). A recently recognized player is the CB<sub>1</sub> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1" target="_blank">cannabinoid receptor</a>. AM404, a metabolite of acetaminophen, indirectly activates CB<sub>1</sub> by inhibiting the breakdown and reuptake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide" target="_blank" title="an endocannabinoid"> anandamide</a>, a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the brain  (<a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action" target="_blank">Mallet et al., 2017</a>).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s1600/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="281" data-original-width="387" height="290" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s400/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Speaking of cannabinoids, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" target="_blank">cannabidiol</a> (CBD) <span class="ILfuVd">—</span> the non-intoxicating cousin of THC <span class="ILfuVd">—</span> has a high profile now because of its soaring popularity for <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php" target="_blank">many ailments</a>.

Most CBD use seems to be in the non-therapeutic (placebo) range, because the effective dose for, let's say, anxiety is 10-20 times higher than the average commercial product. You'd have to eat 3-6 bags of cranberry gummies for 285-570 mg of CBD (close to the 300-600 mg recommended dose). Unfortunately, you would also ingest 15-30 mg of THC, which would be quite intoxicating.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">"the typical cup of CBD-infused coffee that you buy in your local trendy coffee shop will have, on average, 5-10 mg of CBD, which is nowhere near the therapeutic dosage [at least 300 mg] required for it to have any kind of anxiolytic effect" <a href="https://t.co/trytic2nf2">https://t.co/trytic2nf2</a></div>— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1121740961774571521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2019</a></blockquote><br /><br /><b>Words Have Meanings</b><br /><br />If acetaminophen were so effective in “mending broken hearts”, “easing heartaches”, and providing a “cure for a broken heart”, we would be a society of perpetually happy automatons, wiping away the suffering of breakup and divorce with a mere OTC tablet. We'd have Tylenol epidemics and Advil epidemics to rival the scourge of the present Opioid Epidemic.<br /><br />Meanwhile, social and political discourse in the US has reached a new low. Ironically, the paracetamol “blissed-out” population is enraged because they can't identify with the feelings or opinions of the masses who are 'different' than they are. Somehow, I don't think it's from taking too much Tylenol. A large-scale global survey could put that thought to rest for good.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="525" data-original-width="663" height="316" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s400/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/26/nope-its-not-just-you-world-around-you-really-is-getting-angrier/" target="_blank"><b><span>Nope, it’s not just you: The world around you really is getting angrier</span></b></a></div><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> This is not true, of course, I was only kidding.

The editors of PLoS ONE have done something that we’re betting Donald Trump will never do: Retract a statement about noisy wind turbines. The journal is pulling a 2014 article, titled “Adaptive neuro-fuzzy methodology for noise assessment of wind turbine,” after concluding that the researchers plagiarized. The corresponding author of the article is Shahaboddin Shamshirban, … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/26/do-wind-turbines-cause-plagiarism-energy-researcher-up-to-20-retractions/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Do wind turbines cause plagiarism?

<p>To win a medal of any kind at the Olympic Games takes years of training, hard work and sacrifice. Standing on an Olympic podium is widely regarded as the pinnacle of an athlete’s career. Nonetheless, only one athlete can win gold, leaving the two runner-up medallists to ponder what might have been. Intriguingly a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7473022">seminal study</a> from the 1992 Olympic Games suggested that this counterfactual thinking was especially painful for silver medallists, who appeared visibly less happy than bronze medallists. The researchers speculated that this may have been because of the different counterfactual thinking they engaged in, with bronze medallists being happy that they didn’t come fourth while silver medallists felt sad that they didn’t win gold.</p>
<p>However, subsequent research based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103104001118">the 2000 Olympic Games</a> did not replicate this finding: this time silver medallists were found to be happier than bronze medallists. To further muddy the waters, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16938038">a study from the 2004 Games</a> was consistent with the seminal research, finding that straight after competition, gold and bronze medallists were more likely to smile than silver medallists, with these smiles being larger and more intense.</p>
<p>Now further insight into the psychology of coming second or third comes via Mark Allen, Sarah Knipler and Amy Chan of the University of Wollongong, who have released <a href="https://shapeamerica.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2019.1592803?journalCode=rjsp20#.XKH5L1VKia4">their findings based on the 2016 Olympic Games</a>. These latest results, published in <em>Journal of Sports Sciences</em>, again challenge that initial eye-grabbing result that suggested bronze medallists are happier than silver medallists, but they support the idea that the nature of counterfactual thinking differs depending on whether athletes come second or third.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36970"></span></p>
<p>In the first study, the researchers had 20 participants rate how happy 486 Olympic medallists looked whilst standing on the podium.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The participants based their judgments on full headshot photos of each athlete, deliberately cropped so that they could not see which medal the athletes had won. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants rated gold medal athletes as being significantly happier than those who won either silver or bronze. They rated bronze medallists as marginally happier than silver medallists, though by such a small margin that it is “likely to be trivial or negligible”, according to Allen and his team.</p>
<p>In their second study, the researchers explored how much counterfactual thinking the different athletes did by having participants analyse the media interviews of 192 silver and bronze medallists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They explored frequency (i.e. how much they dwelt on “what if…” scenarios), direction (i.e. what things could have gone better vs. what things could have been worse) and reference (i.e. reflecting on what they could have done differently vs. what their opponent could have done differently).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They found that silver medallists engaged more frequently in counterfactual thinking than bronze medallists, and that this was likely to be directed towards how the event could have gone better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, both silver and bronze medallists primarily focused on their own performance, but silver medallists more often than bronze medallists also spent time talking about how their opponents had performed.</p>
<p>This study provides updated evidence that suggests that gold medallists are happiest on the podium and that no meaningful difference exists in happiness levels between silver and bronze medallists. However, the thought process and reflections between second and third-placed athletes do seem to vary, with silver medallists being more preoccupied by thoughts of how things could have been better and what would have happened if their opponents had behaved differently. These thought processes may act as a defence mechanism in order to protect their self-esteem and self-image. By reflecting on external factors, such as their opponent’s behaviour, it provides a shield to hide behind and deflect personal criticism away from any shortcomings of their own individual performance.</p>
<p>This study builds on previous research by using a larger sample size, blinding the participants to the outcome of the athletes’ medals, and by using equivalence tests to supplement standard statistical methods (such tests help identify whether a statistically significant finding is actually meaningful). That being said, the researchers note several important limitations, such as that some athletes were so well known that the participants probably knew what medal they had earned.</p>
<p>Other limitations include only using static photos of the athletes posing for the media on top of the podium. If that was to be broadened out to include either video footage or full body shots, this may be beneficial as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23197536">evidence suggests</a> that body language may be a better indicator of emotions than facial expressions.</p>
<p>This research makes a valuable contribution given the mixed findings previously reported. Furthermore, it may inform sports psychologists and coaches who work with athletes that have finished second or third in major competitions, helping them to provide appropriately tailored support.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/Nursing-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>What’s the problem? </strong></h3>
<p>People are increasingly aware of what it means to face a mental health crisis, or to live with an ongoing mental health problem. However, it is less widely known that rates of physical illness among people with long-term mental health conditions are among the highest of any group in society. It may shock you to learn that according to <a href="https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/guidelines_physical_health_and_severe_mental_disorders/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> figures, the lifespan of a person with severe mental health problems is as much as 20 years shorter than that of someone without. This morbidity can mostly be accounted for by physical health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.</p>
<p>We know that these conditions are influenced by modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, substance misuse, and obesity, and that some of these factors are far more common among people with mental health conditions. For example, people with schizophrenia are between 3 and 4 times more likely to be heavy smokers than people who are not affected by such disorders. Inequalities of outcome, like shorter lives and frequent ill-health, are unlikely to change without effective lifestyle interventions, but these interventions are rarely considered across mental healthcare settings as part of an individual’s treatment.</p>
<h3><strong>So what are mental health nurses doing about this?</strong></h3>
<p>Mental health nurses often have a trusted role, developed from building long-term therapeutic relationships with their patients. They can make significant contributions to reductions in physical ill-health burdens for those with severe mental health problems by addressing several common lifestyle risk factors. However, nurses working in the specialty have traditionally focused only on mental health issues, and may have lacked the knowledge and skills necessary to make an impact on physical health.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we do?</strong></h3>
<p>We wanted to know if mental health nurses across the globe are ready for the challenge of improving their physical healthcare skills. We <a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-019-0339-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted a systematic search</a> for published studies discussing mental health nurses’ attitudes and knowledge of routine physical healthcare interventions that can contribute significantly to improving the health of people suffering from mental health conditions. We wanted to determine what nurses know about these issues and their attitude towards them. Specifically, we investigated whether nurses saw physical healthcare as a key part of their role. We also aimed to determine if they felt they had the knowledge and skills to provide routine physical healthcare, and to identify which methods of training show the greatest improvement in the provision of physical healthcare. We rated the quality of each study to ensure the strongest research was given the most consideration.</p>
<blockquote><p>Going forward, we need to determine the most effective ways of training mental health nurses to deliver physical healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>What did we find?  </strong></h3>
<p>This is a fast-growing area of research interest: we found that more than 40 studies have been carried out over the last 25 years, with 31 of these published since the year 2010. The studies we reviewed included over 7,500 mental health nurses internationally. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest accumulation of research about mental health nurses’ experiences of any single subject ever published.</p>
<p>We found that mental health nurses were generally positive about their need to be involved in meeting the physical health needs of the service users they worked with. They saw it as a central part of their role, but some lacked confidence and specific skills. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those with more positive attitudes were inclined to deliver more physical healthcare. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of training mental health nurses to deliver effective physical healthcare interventions lack rigor, and more work is needed on this.</p>
<p>Interestingly, of all the studies we investigated, UK-based nurses were most positive in their attitudes – more so than those in Australia and some Asian countries. <span lang="EN-US">This may be considered surprising as mental health nurse training in the UK is considered more specialized than in many other countries, with more time spent focusing on mental health than physical health. </span></p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean? </strong></h3>
<p>These findings are good news insofar as nurses in this specialist field recognize and value the role they can and should play in improving health outcomes for this marginalized population group. However, there is still work to be done to improve their knowledge, confidence and skills. There is much less research about how we can do this successfully. Going forward, we need to determine the most effective ways of training mental health nurses to deliver physical healthcare. Further, specialist pre-registration in mental health, like that observed in the UK, does not seem to disadvantage nurses in terms of their self-rated physical healthcare skills.</p>
<h3><strong>What would be the benefit for patients?  </strong></h3>
<p>Mental health nurses require more skills in the delivery of interventions to address lifestyle issues. If they felt better prepared to deliver smoking cessation, alcohol-related advice, weight management, and sexual healthcare, then, over time, we confidently predict improvement in the current statistics of poor physical health of people with mental health problems. Ultimately, along with other advances in care, we would expect to see people with long-term mental health problems living progressively longer and healthier lives.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p><i>You can have £10 today or £12 next week. Which do you go for?</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Being able to forego a reward now in favour of gaining something better later is known to be important in determining all kinds of desirable outcomes in life, including greater educational attainment, social functioning and health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, choosing to delay gratification won’t <i>always</i> be the best option. If you’re in desperate circumstances – you badly need money to buy food, for example – taking the £10 today could be sensible. But this isn’t necessarily an entirely conscious judgment – there may be biological systems that automatically shift your decision-making priorities according to what is most likely to enhance your survival. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41437-1.epdf">new open-access study</a> published in <i>Scientific Reports</i> provides evidence that having raised levels of inflammation in your body, which is generally caused by the immune system’s response to infection or injury, can skew your judgment to focus more on present rewards, and on instant gratification. If further research backs this up, there could be wide-ranging implications not only for understanding why some people are more impulsive than others, but even for treating substance abuse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36967"></span></p>
<p>Jeffrey Gassen and colleagues at the Texas Christian University, US, reasoned that inflammation should enhance a person’s desire for immediately available resources, as the body’s response to sickness requires extra energy, and, for a sick person, their future is less certain. To explore whether this is actually the case, they recruited 159 healthy, non-obese, young college students who abstained from behaviours that can cause an acute increase in inflammation, such as smoking, exercise, sex and drinking alcohol, for two days prior to the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants completed a widely-used impulsiveness scale, an instant gratification inventory, as well as two behavioural assessments – one of which explored their preferences for smaller and immediate vs. larger, delayed rewards. The participants also reported their body mass index, physical activity levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, stress and other variables (all of which relate to having a greater focus on the present, to inflammation levels, or both).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants then gave blood samples, which were checked for levels of three pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins that indicate greater inflammation). The researchers found that participants with higher levels of inflammation also tended to have a style of decision-making characterised by impulsivity, a focus on the present, and an inability to delay gratification.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This analysis alone of course cannot indicate the direction of the relationship. Might it rather be the case that harmful, present-focused behaviours were driving higher levels of inflammation? The researchers explored this possibility by looking to see whether particular behaviours – usual levels of smoking, alcohol intake and risky sexual behaviours, for instance – predicted greater inflammation. But none did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might sound surprising (as smoking, for example, has been clearly associated with inflammation in past studies). But these participants were chosen on purpose to be healthy and young. They were also instructed to avoid such behaviours for 48 hours prior to the study, in theory to make it easier to isolate any effects of inflammation on decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All in all, “these results suggest that the activities of the immune system may play an important role in shaping decision-making preferences,” Gassen and his colleagues write. In doing so, they add “…to the growing body of research demonstrating that the internal, physiological condition of the body plays an important role in modulating decision-making and behaviour.”</p>
<p>If further experimental work can firm up this link, there could be “exciting new possibilities” for treating substance abuse disorders, the researchers suggest, and there could be implications for people who have experienced early life stress, who are known to be more prone to inflammation. Drug-based or behavioural interventions targeted at reducing circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines might possibly “sever the link between an individual’s propensity to inflammation and undesirable behaviours, improving outcomes for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers themselves point out, clearly a lot more work has to be done. But as they also note, this study was on healthy young people, with relatively low levels of inflammation. People with chronic illness or obesity have persistently high levels and the activity of their immune system may then have an even greater effect on the way that they behave and even think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/tick-2371827_640-620x342-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The incidence of Lyme disease, caused by tick-borne <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> bacteria, has now reached epidemic proportions in the US. There are an estimated 400,000 cases per year, with numbers rising due to climate change and habitat expansion of the tick vector. Early symptoms include skin rash, fever, and joint pain. With timely diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most patients recover.</p>
<p>However, treatment fails in at least <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430045/">10-20% of patients</a>, who develop persistent symptoms including chronic pain, cognitive dysfunction, and debilitating fatigue. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). These symptoms are often severe, frequently leading to profound personal, educational, and monetary losses.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until now, estimates of the number of people in the US living with PTLD were not available. This manuscript provides the framework for a mathematical modeling technique that can be used to estimate the prevalence of PTLD in the US. We apply our technique to three incidence scenarios and two failure rates to estimate the cumulative prevalence of PTLD in the years 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US. The 95% confidence intervals suggest that incident rates could even reach as high as 2.3 million cases. All results indicate the prevalence of PTLD is rising over time. The approach we present provides a framework for updating prevalence estimates in future years and when more precise input data become available.</p>
<p>Our PTLD estimates are calculated using mathematical modeling and simulation, counting survivors of cases originating from 1980 until two index dates, 2016 and 2020. This framework incorporates multiple data types from several sources. We first propose three possible trajectories for the annual incidence of Lyme disease, and model the growth of the epidemic during the years the disease has been documented in the US. These trajectories were based on previously published information about Lyme disease incidence rates, originating from two sources.</p>
<p>One source was based on public health surveillance, when medical clinicians report Lyme disease cases to local and state health authorities. This method estimated 34,449 cases per year by 2005. The second source was obtained by US CDC epidemiologists and was based on studies of either Lyme disease testing lab results or health insurance claims. These sources calculated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26291194">more than 300,000 incident cases per year</a> by 2005.</p>
<p>The disparity between these two numbers indicates vast under-reporting by health authorities, is consistent with community-based reports that suggest large numbers of cases, and exemplifies shortfalls in the current Lyme disease knowledge base. It is possible that actual incidence rates are much higher.</p>
<p>Based on these two figures of annual incidence, we modeled three scenarios of growth of the Lyme disease epidemic: linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 34,449 by 2005, then remaining stable at 34,449 thereafter (Scenario A in Figure 1); linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005, then remaining stable at 329,000 thereafter (Scenario B); or linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005 and continued linear growth onward (Scenario C).</p>

The vertical bars represent 95% coverage intervals about the means.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The second important input measure in calculating cumulative PTLD cases was a treatment failure rate, which has been estimated at up to 40% of cases in some studies. We chose to more narrowly define this as either 10% or 20%. These two failure rates, combined with three incidence scenarios, resulted in six mathematical simulations.</p>
<p>All simulations accounted for age and gender distributions of Lyme disease diagnosis, as well as life expectancy. For example, if a five-year-old girl diagnosed in 1983 with Lyme disease was among the 10-20% with PTLD, she might still be alive and counted in 2020. However, a 55-year old man diagnosed at the same time might not be.</p>
<p>Our prevalence estimates reveal there are likely millions of people struggling with chronic illness and disability due to the effects of Lyme disease. In addition, they and their families are impacted financially, because they are often unable to work or complete educations, and are forced to bear the medical costs themselves.</p>
<p>Treating acute Lyme disease alone has been estimated to cost <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2015/lyme-disease-costs-more-than-one-billion-dollars-per-year-to-treat-study-finds.html">over $1 billion per year</a> in the US. The costs of treating this chronic disease have not been determined, but are expected to be high. Our study is a first step toward more understanding of the burden of PTLD, and reinforces the need for greatly expanding research that will lead to better treatment of these patients.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>What is the problem with informal sector abortions?</strong></h3>
<p>Despite abortion being legal in many countries, women in both high- and low-income countries commonly seek to terminate unwanted pregnancies outside of the formal healthcare system. Informal sector abortions (ISAs) are not inherently unsafe, particularly when performed by a skilled healthcare provider using safe drugs. However, when clinical guidelines are not followed, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521693414001059" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the procedure carries a high risk of complications</a> such as hemorrhage, renal failure, infertility, trauma to internal organs, and, in some cases, death. As a result, ISAs are an important contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality and morbidity.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we do?</strong></h3>
<p>In our recently published <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0751-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">systematic review</a>, we looked at all the qualitative evidence published in English and French on the reasons why women may decide to seek ISAs where abortion is legal, in both high- and low-income settings. We found a total of 16 studies carried out between 1998 and 2018 in ten countries, including five in Sub-Saharan Africa along with Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Cambodia, and the United States. Thirteen of the studies recruited women who had undergone or attempted to undergo an ISA, while the others were based on the analysis of secondary data on the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we learn?</strong></h3>
<p>The studies we surveyed confirmed the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative evidence</a> that the practice of ISA is a widespread phenomenon. The medical risks associated with ISA were well known to the women involved, but fears over medical safety were outweighed by the reservations they had about abortions in formal health facilities.</p>
<p>Ten key reasons were identified for opting for informal sector abortion, ranging from privacy and attitude of healthcare staff, costs involved with formal abortions and timeliness of the procedure. Concerns over <em>privacy</em> in legal health facilities were listed as a key reason in thirteen of the studies. <em>Costs</em> associated with legal abortion services was an issue that came up in ten of the studies included. A <em>lack of knowledge of abortion laws</em> was frequently mentioned too, together with a widespread perception that abortion is not legal, even when it really is. Pregnant women’s <em>fears of mistreatment by staff</em> and <em>staff unwillingness to provide abortion or to make a referral</em> were mentioned as deterrents to seeking a legal abortion in some of the studies. A preference for <em>self-managed abortions at home</em> and <em>timeliness</em> of service were also cited in a few of the studies.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10982" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10982 size-medium" height="155" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-300x155.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">from Chemlal and Russo, 2019</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>A key finding of this study is the existence of two pathways to seeking an informal sector abortion. In the first category, women first sought a legal abortion at a formal health facility and only turned to the informal sector when they were unable to proceed through the legal route.</p>
<p>The second trajectory involved women who directly sought an informal sector abortion for the above reasons, without first trying to obtain a legal service; for women in this pathway, ISA was regarded as the normal trajectory for seeking abortion. Formal sector abortion was the last resort after multiple, ineffective clandestine abortion attempts or for treatment after post-abortion complications.</p>
<p>Among the study participants, unsafe abortion was not spoken of solely in terms of medical and physical safety, but also in terms of social and economic security. Abortion facilities that did not protect women’s anonymity were deemed to be unsafe. This was mainly due to the fact that societal attitudes to abortion were largely negative and that severe repercussions, such as loss of livelihood and being shunned by their community, hold back women from openly seeking termination of unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h3>
<p>Preventing unsafe abortions requires a comprehensive understanding of all the drivers behind each stage of the decision-making process. These include the reasons for unwanted pregnancy, the initial decision to seek an abortion, the choice of provider and method, as well as post-abortion care seeking.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is potential to address informal sector abortions through education and information campaigns</p></blockquote>
<p>There has been a tendency for studies to focus almost exclusively on countries where abortion is prohibited, neglecting the issue of ISAs in countries where abortion is legal. Our review addresses this gap and identifies a number of issues with formal service providers that in some cases push women to obtain abortions through the informal sector, while highlighting that too little is known about this topic in North Africa, the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<h3><strong>What can we do with this information?</strong></h3>
<p>A number of areas for potential intervention have also been highlighted. For example, the influence of women’s social networks in shaping their abortion trajectories was an important point discussed in this review – this means there is potential to address ISAs through education and information campaigns in those communities.</p>
<p>The use of medical abortion pills for self-induction, as a harm reduction program, is another area of interest. When women are provided with information on recommended dosages and administration of the drug, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23228504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence shows that self-induction using misoprostol can be safe</a>. Women’s preference for self-managed abortions for early stage pregnancies also lends credibility to recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20067668" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies on women’s views on the acceptability of home managed abortions</a>; governments should recognize this is rapidly becoming an option for unwanted pregnancies, and avoid driving the practice underground, where it can truly become dangerous.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>We all know the powerful effect that music can have on mood. You might be feeling rather chirpy, but then a tear-jerker comes on the car radio and you arrive home feeling morose (conversely, of course, happy tunes can lift our spirits). For most of us, these effects are not a big deal. But what if you are living with depression? Now the implications become more serious. And, according to a provocative <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295">study</a> published a few years ago, far from seeking out uplifting music, people diagnosed with depression are notably more inclined than healthy controls to choose to listen to sad music (and look at sad images). The controversial implication is that depressed people deliberately act in ways that are likely to maintain their low mood. Now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001">study</a> in the journal <em>Emotion</em> has replicated this finding, but the researchers also present evidence suggesting depressed people are <em>not</em> seeking to maintain their negative feelings, but rather that they find sad music calming and even uplifting.</p>
<p>“The current study is the most definitive to date in probing depression-related preferences for sad music using different tasks, and the reasons for these preferences,” write the team at the University of South Florida, led by Sunkyung Yoon.</p>
<p><span id="more-36960"></span></p>
<p>The research involved 38 female undergrads diagnosed with depression and 38 non-depressed female undergrad controls. The first part of the study was a replication attempt using the same materials as the 2015 paper that found depressed people preferred sad music. The participants listened to 30-second excerpts of sad (“Adagio for Strings” by Samuel Barber” and “Rakavot” by Avi Balili), happy and neutral music, and stated which they would prefer to listen to again in the future. Successfully replicating the earlier research, Yoon and his team found that their depressed participants were more likely to choose the sad music clips.</p>
<p>However, unlike in that earlier research, Yoon’s team also asked their participants why they made the choices they did. The majority of the participants with depression who favoured sad music said that they did so because it was relaxing, calming or soothing.</p>
<p>The second part of the study used new music samples: 84 pairs of 10-second clips of instrumental film music, contrasting happy, sad, fear-inducing, neutral, and also high and low energy tracks. In each case the same participants as before indicated which music they’d prefer to listen to again later. They also heard all the samples again at the end and stated what effect they had on their emotions. The researchers found again that people with depression had a far greater preference than controls for sad, low-energy music (but not fear-inducing music). Critically, though, when they heard these clips again, they reported that they made them feel more happiness and less sadness, contradicting the provocative idea that depressed people are seeking to perpetuate their low mood.</p>
<p>This study is unable to speak to why depressed people find low-energy, sad music uplifting, although common sense suggests that if you are feeling down, then a fast-paced, happy clappy tune might be irritating and inappropriate, whereas a more soothing, serious tune could be comforting. Further clues come from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/">another recent study</a> that investigated why (non-depressed) people generally like listening to sad music when they’re feeling down – for instance, some participants said the sad music acted like a supportive friend.</p>
<p>The new research involved only a small sample of female undergrads, and it only looked at emotional effects over a short time frame. Yoon and his colleagues acknowledge more research is needed to find out why exactly depressed people favour sad music. For now though, the new findings suggest that this preference  “… may reflect a desire for calming emotional experience rather than a desire to augment sad feelings.”</p>

<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, there is an ongoing debate about the existence of differences between women’s and men’s brains, and the extent to which these might be linked to biological or to cultural factors. In this debate, a real game-changer of a study would involve the identification of clear-cut sex differences in foetal brains: that is, in brains that have not yet been exposed to all the different expectations and experiences that the world might offer. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929318301245">recent open-access study</a> published in <i>Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience</i> by Muriah Wheelock at the University of Washington and her colleagues, including senior researcher Moriah Thomason at New York University School of Medicine, claims to have done just that, hailed by the researchers themselves as “confirmation that sexual dimorphism in functional brain systems emerges during human gestation” and in various ways by the popular press as, for example, <i>The Times of London’s</i> headline: “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/proof-at-last-women-and-men-are-born-to-be-different-33k2lvtn5?shareToken=2a2976e6335802e0b61b2f0f86e0092f">Proof at last: women and men are born to be different</a>”.</p>
<p>Does this study live up to the claims made by its authors and, more excitedly, those passing the message on? I think not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36954"></span></p>
<p>The study is certainly heroic in methodological terms, comprising a challenging recruitment and scanning strategy to capture “resting state” data (brain activity during rest rather than during an active task) from over 100 prenatal participants. As well as not having direct access to their participants, the experimenters had to devise extraordinarily complex ways of controlling for their movement – a challenge for any brain scan study, but particularly those hoping to measure connectivity. This involved the researchers identifying the “stillest” periods in each 12-24 minute foetal resting state scan, and then performing subsequent re-alignment and readjustments (or, effectively, cutting and pasting of each of lowest movement epochs together for analysis). We are told that 40 per cent of the acquired data had to be discarded in this process (something that should be borne in mind in assessing the validity and reliability of the data).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Having identified 197 regions of interest (ROIs) in these foetal brain images, the researchers looked at how the activity in each region was correlated with the activity in all the others (a stronger correlation is taken as a sign of greater connectivity), resulting in an analysis of 19,306 connections or pairings between regions. The researchers then used an innovative method to identify significant clusterings in the data, to see if there were any networks or “hubs” of connectivity. It should be noted that the correlations were calculated separately for the males and females and that an uncorrected p-threshold of 0.05 was applied to the resulting correlations, both rather questionable statistical practices when working with data sets such as these.</p>
<p>Early versions of the overall methodological approach used here have previously been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929314000644?via=ihub">reported by the same research team </a>, providing fascinating insights into the formation of neural connectivity systems in utero and how these change with gestational age. The basis for the current paper is a much bigger data set than they used previously, which could have continued to develop these insights. Sadly, and rather inexplicably, their focus here is on differences in connectivity between female and male foetuses. This is unfortunate, not because identifying prenatal sex differences in the brain is not a crucial process in this debate, but because this data set just does not lend itself to this kind of “hunt-the-difference” agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One problem is that, of the 118 participants whose data survived all of the necessary exclusion criteria, 48 were female and 70 were male. This imbalance, together with the skewed distribution of several other demographic factors, such as gestational age when the scans took place, meant that the researchers had to use what are known as “nonparametric statistics” for many of their comparisons. This form of analysis, as well as lacking power, precludes the kind of multivariate analysis which would have allowed the researchers to consider multiple factors at once. For example, there was no way of <i>simultaneously</i> testing the relative contributions of differences in gestational age and differences in foetal sex to different types of network pairs (connections between different brain regions). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A related problem is the wide age range of the participants: from 25 weeks to 39 gestational weeks. That 14 week period covers a time of dramatic cortical development, especially the formation of cortical networks – a 25 week-old brain will be very different from a 39 week-old one. Although the researchers treated gestational age as a continuous variable, there is a query as to the comparability of the male and female groups with respect to this measure. In the age window 36-40 weeks (very near full-term), there were 35 males compared with only 17 females. Even with appropriate statistical controls, this could well have skewed the findings.</p>
<p>Related to this, there are concerns about the “normalisation” process carried out on each scan. This allows group analysis of images from different participants by “warping” them to a standard template so that locations on each image “line up” for comparison. What to select for a standard template is a tricky question for relatively comparable adult scans; here the researchers selected a 32-week foetal brain template, which could well have been inappropriate for <i>any</i> of the individual scans they were processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>False impressions:</b></p>
<p>It is also important to note what was NOT reported in this study. The researchers’ focus was almost entirely on the sex <i>differences</i> they found, with little comment on evidence of the <i>sex similarities</i>. In one of their figures, for example, the researchers illustrate 136 possible sex by connectivity comparisons, of which only 3 showed a statistically significant difference between the sexes. And remember that, overall, there were connections between over 19,000 possible regions to consider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers use the term “sexual dimorphism” or “dimorphism” more than half a dozen times, including in that powerful statement from their abstract that I quoted at the start of my blog post. But their data do NOT demonstrate a dimorphic state – as well as the much greater incidence of <i>no</i> differences between the groups, we have no way of assessing just how different (or not) the connectivity pathways were. As so many of the sex-linked comparisons were based merely on contrasting the number of significant correlations between brain regions for males and females – for instance, one of the figures in the paper shows significant connectivity between 5 pairs of brain networks in female foetuses, as opposed to significant connectivity between 2 different brain networks in males – we have no idea of the effect size (the practical meaning) of any differences, nor the extent of overlap between the two groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Any studies focussing on sex differences in the brain have the potential to help explain gender gaps, not only in behaviour, personality and preferences, but also in differences in the occurrence of physical and mental health problems. Studies such as this could be invaluable for understanding the typical and atypical developmental trajectories which may lead to such gaps. But, equally, studies such as this can contribute to stereotypical essentialist beliefs that there are innate, fixed and inevitable sex differences in the brain (and therefore in behaviour and preferences). This can have significant downstream consequences for how society comes to understand, explain and even sustain these very gender gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data in this study offer an exciting and innovative look at the development of functional brain networks in the human brain, using complex and revelatory analyses. They do <b><i>not </i></b>offer confirmation of sexual dimorphism in human brain networks in utero and the authors of the study should not, I believe, be making this claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A Swedish company called Emotra make a device to detect someone's risk of suicide based on measuring the body's autonomic responses to certain sounds. It's called EDOR®.



I've been blogging about this machine for the past 18 months (1, 2, 3) because such a product, if it worked, would be very important. It could help save countless lives. Unfortunately, I don't think EDOR® has been proven to be effective. As I've argued in my previous posts, the evidence just isn't there yet.

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/palm-beach-county-students-compete-in-max-planck-floridas-brain-bee-challenge/">Palm Beach County Students Compete in Max Planck Florida’s Brain Bee Challenge</a></h4>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8<sup>th</sup> annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”</p>
<p>Wait…<em>Zombies?</em></p>
<p>While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about <span>learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.</p>
<p>“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.</p>
