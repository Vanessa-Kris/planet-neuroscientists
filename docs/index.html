<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781635574944">Wild Souls</a><br /><em>Emma Marris<br />Bloomsbury, $28</em></p>



<p>On the Arctic Ocean’s fringe, polar bears stand on ice thinning from human-caused climate change. Without thick ice from which to powerfully pounce on seals, many of these symbols of the wild north can’t eat. Should we feed polar bears to right our wrongs? Or should we leave them alone, even if that means they starve to extinction?</p>



<p>Emma Marris’ <em>Wild Souls </em>prompts readers to grapple with this question and more. An absorbing and nuanced blend of philosophy and science, the book explores what we owe the nonhuman world. Like her 2011 book <em>Rambunctious Garden</em>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-rambunctious-garden-saving-nature-post-wild-world-emma-marris">challenged the notion</a> of “pristine wilderness” in a world where humans touch everything (<em>SN: 9/23/11</em>), <em>Wild Souls </em>questions the very concepts of wildness and nature. The result challenges readers to reconsider how they relate to nonhuman animals, from caged creatures to polar bears in the warming north.</p>





<p>Marris guides readers through a series of case studies, from Indigenous hunting practices to municipal zoos, all brought to life through attentive on-the-ground reporting. Running through these examples is a central ethical tension: How do we weigh the tangible moral value of an individual sentient creature who can suffer against the more abstract value of species or ecosystems, which are of course unfeeling but rouse such depths of emotion in us when they are threatened or lost?</p>





<p>Islands are a front line of this conflict, where life that’s blossomed in isolation is threatened by species we’ve introduced. Marris examines efforts, from the Galápagos to New Zealand, to kill (often painfully with poison) millions of individual mice, rats and other creatures in the name of preserving species deemed more important. </p>



<p>Marris is frank on where she stands on certain issues, arguing, for example, that zoos are immoral. She also asks whether it’s ever right to save a species like the California condor — which once soared above most of North America but dwindled to just a handful of individuals in the 1980s — by caging them for captive breeding.</p>



<p>The book makes a clear case for the moral value of individual sentient creatures, providing a rundown of the latest science that dissolves the distinct line often drawn between humans and nonhumans. These include studies that suggest fish feel pain and that rats help fellow rats in need because they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscience-mice-may-catch-each-others-pain-relief-contagious">experience emotions</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Defining the objective, inherent value of species proves trickier. “There’s something precious in what we call ‘nature,’ in the flow of energy, in the will to survive,” she writes. “But I cannot present overwhelming arguments that this is true. I can only passionately assert it.”</p>



<p>In the end, Marris finds no set formula for making ethical choices about animals’ fates. Instead, readers may realize something profound: There are no perfect ways to act ethically toward all animals and all species when incommensurable values collide. As we try to mend the mess we’ve made of nature, all we can do is act with thoughtful humility.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes</a></h4>

<p>Threadlike filaments pressed in rock <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabf3963">may be the remnants of archaea</a> that burped methane near hydrothermal vents 3.42 billion years ago.  If so, these strands in rock excavated in South Africa around a decade ago, would provide the earliest direct evidence of a methane-based metabolism, researchers report July 14 in <em>Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth’s early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life.  Scientists suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">life on our planet</a> could have arisen in such an environment (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Biologists have deduced that metabolisms based on munching or belching methane evolved early on, but don’t know exactly when, says Barbara Cavalazzi, a geobiologist at University of Bologna in Italy. Previous research has found indirect evidence for methane-cycling microbes in the chemistry of fluid-filled pockets of ancient rocks from around 3.5 billion years ago. But that work didn’t find the actual microbes. With this fossil analysis, “what we find, basically, is evidence of about the same age. But this is a cellular remain — it’s the organism,” Cavalazzi says.</p>



<p>The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. That shell is different structurally from the preserved interior, suggesting a cell envelope enclosing the cells’ insides, the authors write. And the team found relatively high nickel concentrations in the filaments. The concentrations were similar to levels found in modern methane-makers, suggesting the fossils’ metal may come from nickel-containing enzymes in the microbes.</p>





<p>“They can attribute a specific metabolic lifestyle to these early microorganisms,” says Dominic Papineau, a Precambrian biogeochemist at University College London, who was not part of the study and calls it “brilliant work.”</p>



<p>Yet the search for early life-forms has had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-fossil-biomorphs-more-common-ancient-rocks-real-fossils">its share of false signs</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>) , and some researchers aren’t convinced these fossils are the real deal. In silica-rich hydrothermal environments, the ingredients for structures that mimic cells mingle and can form life look-alikes through chemistry, says Julie Cosmidis, a geobiologist at the University of Oxford. “They fossilize better than actual cells, so I think it could very well be what those things are,” she says, pointing out that nickel, common in the early Earth, clings easily to organic matter, whether it’s living or not. “We don’t understand enough [about] the processes that can create false biosignatures,” says Cosmidis, whose lab studies such questions.</p>



<p>But Cavalazzi and her colleagues contend that the different lines of evidence together support the living origin of the microfossils. Papineau also notes that “the evidence is very good,” but adds that it’s “not necessarily rock solid.” Other tests could strengthen the case for the earliest methane-using microbes, he says.</p>



<p>If the strands are ancient archaea, they’d become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago. And if such microbes evolved so quickly on Earth, within around 1 billion years of the planet’s origin, methane-cyclers may be more common than realized on other planets where liquid water has been around for a while, Papineau says.</p>



<p>This fossil comes from a time when Earth’s planetary ecosystem was likely very different than it is now, says Boris Sauterey, a paleoecologist at the University of Arizona in Tempe, who wasn’t involved with this study. Back then, Earth most likely shared similarities with some of the extraterrestrial worlds that we today would consider potentially habitable, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers looking for signs of early life on Earth have explored sediments of surface waters more than hydrothermal systems, where these fossils were found, Cavalazzi says. The discovery suggests, she says, that here and on other planets, researchers should keep scratching below the surface.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>During the pandemic, many of us were locked down with little face-to-face contact with anybody other than our partners. Considering the stress of the time and the intensely close quarters we were in, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a recipe for serious tension.</p>



<p>A new study, however, suggests the reality might not be so cut and dry. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506211022813">Writing in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em>, </em>a team led by Lisa A. Neff from The University of Texas at Austin found that the pandemic actually played an important part in people’s ability to deal with stress. When couples blamed their levels of stress on the pandemic, the team found, they were happier in their relationship.</p>



<span id="more-43014"></span>



<p>Participants were people living with their partner during the lockdown in the United States, who completed daily measures for 14 days during the April lockdown and then again seven months later (almost all couples were heterosexual, though several participants were non-binary).</p>



<p>In each questionnaire, participants indicated on a scale from one to five how much they blamed themselves, their partner, and the pandemic for their current levels of stress or problems. Next, participants were presented with eleven different parts of their life, from work to finances to household chores, and were asked to indicate how stressful or problematic that element of life had been that day. They also completed measures of relationship satisfaction, and indicated whether they had performed any negative behaviours towards their partner (e.g. criticising or directing anger towards their partner, or acting withdrawn or distant).</p>



<p>During both waves of the study, participants on the whole were more likely to blame the pandemic for feelings of stress than they were themselves or their partners. And blaming the pandemic seemed to be beneficial for their relationships, at least for the female participants: on days they found particularly stressful, women who blamed the pandemic for the stress reported greater satisfaction in their relationship than those who did not. They also reported behaving in fewer negative ways towards their partners, again suggesting that the act of blaming the pandemic acted as a buffering force in romantic relationships.</p>



<p>For female participants, the pandemic seemed to act as a “scapegoat”, as the team put it, which can protect relationships from undue stress. The team suggests that stress “spillover” — the spilling of external stressors like work into a relationship — was lessened due to heightened stress awareness and ability to blame a massive global event which was a very obvious source of stress. (Of course, it’s important to remember that many people <em>have</em> struggled with their relationships during the pandemic, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/16/im-grateful-for-our-intense-lockdown-split-what-has-the-pandemic-done-to-our-relationships">in some cases</a> the unique combination of factors thrown up by coronavirus really was a recipe for divorce.)</p>



<p>This spillover was also positioned as a reason why women participants were more likely to benefit from blaming the pandemic than men. Other research has suggested women experienced more distress during the pandemic, as well as more dissatisfaction with the allocation of tasks at home and their work-life balance. Women may therefore be more vulnerable to stress spillover — and this could be why they benefited more from blaming the stress on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Future work could look at periods of more intense stress. Although the pandemic as a whole was stressful for many, most participants in this study were experiencing low levels of stress on a daily basis; the daily diary method may also have felt labour intensive for those experiencing high levels of stress, leading them to drop out.</p>



<p>People may also have been blaming their stress on the pandemic precisely because it was caused by the pandemic: it’s not hard to imagine, for example, that stress and bad feelings have been triggered by pandemic-induced job insecurity, concerns about vulnerable relatives, or the monotony of lockdown. If that’s the case, it’s not a huge surprise that participants were happier in their relationship on days they blamed the pandemic — because there might not be anything wrong with their relationship to begin with.</p>



<p>On the whole, however, the findings suggest that relationships can thrive — or at least survive — when couples are aware of stress and feel able to discuss it openly: advice that probably holds outside of a pandemic as much as it does in.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-death-physics-electromagnetism-standard-model">With Steven Weinberg’s death, physics loses a titan</a></h4>

<p>Mythology has its titans. So do the movies. And so does physics. Just one fewer now.</p>



<p>Steven Weinberg died July 23, at the age of 88. He was one of the key intellectual leaders in physics during the second half of the 20th century, and he remained a leading voice and active contributor and teacher through the first two decades of the 21st.</p>



<p>On lists of the greats of his era he was always mentioned along with Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann and … well, just Feynman and Gell-Mann.</p>



<p>Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science. He exuded intelligence and dignity. As news of his death spread through Twitter, other physicists expressed their remorse at the loss: “One of the most accomplished scientists of our age,” one commented, “a particularly eloquent spokesman for the scientific worldview.” And another: “One of the best physicists we had, one of the best thinkers of any variety.”</p>





<p>Weinberg’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/">Nobel Prize, awarded in 1979</a>, was for his role in developing a theory unifying electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. That was an essential contribution to what became known as the standard model of physics, a masterpiece of explanation for phenomena rooted in the math describing subatomic particles and forces. It’s so successful at explaining experimental results that physicists have long pursued every opportunity to find the slightest deviation, in hopes of identifying “new” physics that further deepens human understanding of nature.</p>



<p>Weinberg did important technical work in other realms of physics as well, and wrote several authoritative textbooks on such topics as general relativity and cosmology and quantum field theory. He was an early advocate of superstring theory as a promising path in the continuing quest to complete the standard model by unifying it with general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity.</p>



<p>Early on Weinberg also realized a desire to communicate more broadly. His popular book <em>The First Three Minutes</em>, published in 1977, introduced a generation of physicists and physics fans to the Big Bang–birth of the universe and the fundamental science underlying that metaphor. Later he wrote deeply insightful examinations of the nature of science and its intersection with society. And he was a longtime contributor of thoughtful essays in such venues as the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p>



<p>In his 1992 book <em>Dreams of a Final Theory</em>, Weinberg expressed his belief that physics was on the verge of finding the true fundamental explanation of reality, the “final theory” that would unify all of physics. Progress toward that goal seemed to be impeded by the apparent incompatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the math underlying the standard model. But in a 1997 interview, Weinberg averred that the difficulty of combining relativity and quantum physics in a mathematically consistent way was an important clue. “When you put the two together, you find that there really isn’t that much free play in the laws of nature,” he said. “That’s been an enormous help to us because it’s a guide to what kind of theories might possibly work.”</p>



<p>Attempting to bridge the relativity-quantum gap, he believed, “pushed us a tremendous step forward toward being able to develop realistic theories of nature on the basis of just mathematical calculations and pure thought.”</p>



<p>Experiment had to come into play, of course, to verify the validity of the mathematical insights. But the standard model worked so well that finding deviations implied by new physics required more powerful experimental technology than physicists possessed. “We have to get to a whole new level of experimental competence before we can do experiments that reveal the truth beneath the standard model, and this is taking a long, long time,” he said. “I really think that physics in the style in which it’s being done … is going to eventually reach a final theory, but probably not while I’m around and very likely not while you’re around.”</p>



<p>He was right that he would not be around to see the final theory. And perhaps, as he sometimes acknowledged, nobody ever will. Perhaps it’s not experimental power that is lacking, but rather intellectual power. “Humans may not be smart enough to understand the really fundamental laws of physics,” he wrote in his 2015 book <em>To Explain the World</em>, a history of science up to the time of Newton.</p>



<p>Weinberg studied the history of science thoroughly, wrote books and taught courses on it. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-looks-back-rise-scientific-method"><em>To Explain the World</em></a> was explicitly aimed at assessing ancient and medieval science in light of modern knowledge. For that he incurred the criticism of historians and others who claimed he did not understand the purpose of history, which is to understand the human endeavors of an era on its own terms, not with anachronistic hindsight.</p>



<p>But Weinberg understood the viewpoint of the historians perfectly well. He just didn’t like it. For Weinberg, the story of science that was meaningful to people today was how the early stumblings toward understanding nature evolved into a surefire system for finding correct explanations. And that took many centuries. Without the perspective of where we are now, he believed, and an appreciation of the lessons we have learned, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/physicists-story-science-breaks-historians-rules">the story of how we got here “has no point.”</a></p>



<p>Future science historians will perhaps insist on assessing Weinberg’s own work in light of the standards of his times. But even if viewed in light of future knowledge, there’s no doubt that Weinberg’s achievements will remain in the realm of the Herculean. Or the titanic.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">What experts know so far about COVID-19 boosters for immunocompromised people</a></h4>

<p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised. </p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852">organ transplant recipients</a>, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lucky enough to have access to shots</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259776v1">twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised</a>, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus</a> and prevent severe disease (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups. </p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.  </p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December. </p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised: </p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0282">boosted the antibody levels</a> of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.  </li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861">had detectable antibodies after a third dose</a>, researchers reported June 23 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose. </li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01594-4/fulltext">stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses</a> of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.21259913v1">half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab193/6289996"> 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients</a>, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in <em>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</em>. </li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said. </p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">How do scientists calculate the age of a star?</a></h4>

<p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">Turns out it was just a phase</a>.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">magnetically active</a> compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806">can give astronomers ballpark estimates</a>. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



<h3>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams</h3>



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram"> plot stars’ temperature against their brightness</a>. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>

<h3>Rotation rate</h3>



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...171..565S/abstract">propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age</a>: Rotation rate = (Age)<sup> -½</sup>.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



<h3>Stellar seismology</h3>



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler space telescope</a>. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">collided</a> with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age</a> as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">NASA’s TESS</a> and the European Space Agency’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-new-mission-to-investigate-exoplanets-has-rocketed-into-space"> CHEOPS</a> survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">A partial skeleton reveals the world’s oldest known shark attack</a></h4>

<p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/jomon-genes">Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/97</em>) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002777">places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago</a>, the researchers report in the August<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A roughly <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/caribarch/education/sharks/">1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico</a> previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Marsquakes reveal the Red Planet boasts a liquid core half its diameter</a></h4>

<p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">reached Mars in late 2018</a> and soon afterward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-insight-lander-first-recording-marsquake">detected the first known marsquake</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/</em><em>18</em>; <em>SN: 4/23/19</em>). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abi7730">Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter</a>, he and colleagues report in the July 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>

<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in <em>Science</em>, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf2966">seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet</a>. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in <em>Science</em>, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8966">the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers</a>. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet’s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj8914">a commentary</a>, also published in <em>Science</em>, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Pterosaurs may have been able to fly as soon as they hatched</a></h4>

<p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92499-z">were strong and nimble fliers</a> from the start, researchers report July 22 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature known to take wing, and <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">aka “Monkeydactyl”</a>) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/429621a">flight membranes on the wings</a> of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny <em>Pteranodon</em> juvenile that was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2017.84">capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size</a>.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, <em>Pterodaustro guinazui</em> and <em>Sinopterus dongi</em>. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">not flying long distances</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

<p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their “dark” triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">see this Wikipedia article</a>). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing">exclusion principle</a> that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These <strong>long-lived triplet states</strong> could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming “dark” or non-functional from the experimenter’s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16878313/">Borlinghaus, 2006</a>) as well as STEP microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3481">Schneider et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14766">Wu et al., 2015</a>) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (<a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.200700579">Petrášek and Schwille, 2008</a>), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that <strong>microsecond-long triplet states</strong> do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth986">Donnert et al., 2007</a>). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10193">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-4027">Gautam et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-12-5325">Castanares et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15618-w">Karpf et al., 2020</a>). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1175">Ji et al., 2008</a>), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by <a href="https://brainwindows.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/pulse-shaping-for-2-photon-signal-enhancement/">Andrew Hires</a> and on <a href="http://labrigger.com/blog/2011/12/31/optimizing-pulse-frequency-for-2p-imaging/">Labrigger</a>. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists – using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037565/">Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018</a>, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that <strong>faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield</strong>. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental approach</strong></p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="x(t) = x_0 \cdot sin( t \cdot f_{res} \cdot 2 \pi )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+x_0+%5Ccdot+sin%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" />,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x<sub>0</sub> = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="v(t) = x_0\cdot f_{res} \cdot 2 \pi \cdot cos( t \cdot f_{res} \cdot 2 \pi )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28t%29+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+cos%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" />,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="v_{max} = x_0\cdot f_{res} \cdot 2 \pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_%7Bmax%7D+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" />.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 – 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 – 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let’s call this number the <strong>cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC)</strong> from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="N_{remaining} = N_0 \cdot e^{-CPC/\lambda}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7Bremaining%7D+%3D+N_0+%5Ccdot+e%5E%7B-CPC%2F%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" /></p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, N<sub>remaining</sub>.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part I</strong></p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">Huang et al., 2020</a>). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of <strong>undesired variability</strong>.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is <strong>systematic averaging</strong>. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/12/01/matlab-code-for-instrument-control-of-a-resonant-scanning-microscope/">microscopy control software</a> myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>

<p>This finding also held true for repetitions of the same experiment at different locations of the fish brain and with slightly changed wavelength or average power:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6873" data-attachment-id="6873" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-1-01b" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01b.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01b.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01b.png" data-orig-size="2457,769" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-01b/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01b.png?w=1024" /></figure></div>



<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you’re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6874" data-attachment-id="6874" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-1-01c" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01c.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01c.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01c.png" data-orig-size="2337,689" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-01c/" height="200" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-1-01c.png?w=1024" width="683" /></figure></div>



<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part II</strong></p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That’s how these experiments looked like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we’re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6876" data-attachment-id="6876" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-3-01a" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-3-01a.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-3-01a.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-3-01a.png" data-orig-size="1481,1185" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-3-01a/" height="361" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-3-01a.png?w=1024" width="452" /></figure></div>



<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>

<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish’s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6879" data-attachment-id="6879" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-2-01b" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png" data-orig-size="953,849" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2-01b/" height="304" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=953" width="343" /></figure></div>



<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>

<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample).<strong> I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. </strong>The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. <strong>Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. </strong>Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>

<p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-infection-lung-cell-images">including viral invaders like the coronavirus</a> — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24521-x">clear tracts of cilia</a>, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-critically-ill-patient-double-lung-transplant">cause severe COVID-19</a>, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (<em>SN: 6/11/20</em>). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed.   </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.</figure>



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly.  </p>

<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars has seen its future, and it’s full of rocks. Lots and lots of rocks. After spending the summer trundling through Jezero Crater and checking out the sights, it’s now time for Percy to get to work, teasing out the geologic history of its new home and seeking out signs of ancient microbial life.</p>



<p>“We’ve actually been on a road trip,” project manager Jennifer Trosper, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said at a July 21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66vjDLSt7kQ">news conference</a>. “And during it, we will take our very first sample from the surface of Mars.”</p>



<p>Percy is about 1 kilometer south of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">where it landed on February 18</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). After driving itself around a region of sand dunes, accompanied by its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">tagalong helicopter Ingenuity</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>), the robotic explorer has pulled up to its first sampling spot: a garden of flat, pale stones dubbed paver stones. “This is the area where we are really going to be digging in, both figuratively and literally, to understand the rocks that we have been on for the last several months,” said Kenneth Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech.</p>



<p>The team has been trying to figure out whether these rocks are volcanic or sedimentary. “We still don’t have the answer,” Farley said. Images taken a few centimeters above the surface show what the team is up against: The rocks are littered with dust and pebbles, probably blown in from elsewhere, and the smoother surfaces have a mysterious purplish coating. “All of these factors conspire to prevent us from peering into the rock and actually seeing what it is made out of,” he said.</p>





<p>In the coming weeks, Percy will bore a smooth cavity in one of those rocks and get below the surface crud. Instruments on its robotic arm will then move in close to produce detailed chemical and mineralogical maps that will reveal the rocks’ true nature. Then, sometime in mid-August, the team will extract its first sample. That sample will go into a tube that will eventually get dropped off — along with samples from other locales — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">for some future mission to pick up and bring to Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Cameras scouting farther afield have turned up future sampling sites. A small far-off hill shows hints of finely layered rock that may be mud deposits. “This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential biosignatures,” Farley said.</p>



<p>And the way that rocks are strewn about an ancient river delta in the distance suggests that the lake that once filled Jezero Crater went through multiple episodes of filling in and drying up. If true, Farley said, then the crater may have preserved “multiple time periods when we might be able to look for evidence of ancient life that might have existed on the planet.”</p>

<p>A Venus’s-flower-basket isn’t all show. This stunning deep-sea sponge can also alter the flow of seawater in surprising ways.</p>



<p>A lacy, barrel-shaped chamber forms the sponge’s glassy skeleton. Flow simulations reveal how this intricate structure <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03658-1">alters the way water moves around and through the sponge</a>, helping it endure unforgiving ocean currents and perhaps feed and reproduce, researchers report online July 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Previous studies have found that the gridlike construction of a Venus’s-flower-basket (<em>Euplectella aspergillum</em>) is strong and flexible. “But no one has ever tried to see if these beautiful structures have fluid-dynamic properties,” says mechanical engineer Giacomo Falcucci of Tor Vergata University of Rome.</p>



<p>Harnessing supercomputers, Falcucci and colleagues simulated how water flows around and through the sponge’s body, with and without different skeletal components such as the sponge’s myriad pores. If the sponge were a solid cylinder, water flowing past would form a turbulent wake immediately downstream that could jostle the creature, Falcucci says. Instead water flows through and around the highly porous Venus’s-flower-basket and forms a gentle zone of water that flanks the sponge and displaces turbulence downstream, the team found. That way, the sponge’s body endures less stress.</p>





<p>Ridges that spiral around the outside of the sponge’s skeleton also somehow cause water to slow and swirl inside the structure, the simulations showed. As a result, food and reproductive cells that drift into the sponge would become trapped for up to twice as long as in the same sponge without ridges. That lingering could help the filter feeders catch more plankton. And because Venus’s-flower-baskets can reproduce sexually, it could also enhance the chances that free-floating sperm encounter eggs, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s amazing that such beauty could be so functional, Falcucci says. The sponge’s flow-altering abilities, he says, might help inspire taller, more wind-resistant skyscrapers.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Having a “choice mindset” — believing, in short, that people’s behaviours are “choices”, or deliberate actions driven by their own motives and preferences — has multiple benefits. Those with a choice mindset feel as if they have control over their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-41019-032">own destiny</a>, for example, and see better outcomes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597817307197">negotiations</a>.</p>



<p>There are some drawbacks, however. Choice mindsets can lead to <a href="https://scholar.valpo.edu/fires/14/">victim blaming</a>, a lack of care about inequality, and a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611407928">reduced interest</a> in acts of social good. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211016140?journalCode=sppa">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> takes a closer look at these more troublesome impacts. Yidan Yin from UC San Diego and colleagues find that people in positions of power tend to adopt a choice mindset, which makes them more likely to blame others for mistakes.</p>



<span id="more-42957"></span>



<p>In the first study, 363 participants completed two surveys in a random order. One measured participants’ sense of power, asking how much they agreed with statements such as “I can get others to do what I want”. The other looked at their tendency to apportion blame. Participants were told that the researchers were crowdsourcing a solution to a real issue in their department: whether or not to give a bonus to an administrative assistant who had failed to meet a deadline for a grant, and claimed she had no choice because she was “caught up in other work”. They were then asked how much choice the assistant had in not completing the work, and whether or not they believed she was to blame for missing the deadline. Finally, they were asked to vote on whether or not she should receive the bonus.</p>



<p>The team found that participants with a higher sense of power believed the assistant had more choice, and were less likely to vote to give her a bonus. Similarly, those who perceived the assistant to have more choice blamed her more. This remained the case even when excluding participants who did not believe the scenario was real.</p>



<p>In the second study, the team looked at what happened when people were made to feel more or less powerful. Participants were told they had been placed into teams to rank in order of importance a list of tips about how to succeed on Mechanical Turk (the crowdsourcing website  where the study took place). In the low power condition, participants were told they had been assigned the role of a “worker” who was inferior to other teammates, while in the high power condition they were a supervisor.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to summarise a transcription another team had supposedly made: the transcription was full of errors, which they were told was because the worker’s internet connection was unstable. They then answered questions about the transcription, indicating whether they believed the transcriber had a choice about correcting their errors, how much they were to blame, and whether they should receive payment for the transcription.</p>



<p>Again, participants in the high power group were both more likely to perceive the transcriber as having a choice than those in the low power group, which in turn made them more likely to blame and punish the transcriber by indicating they should not be paid. A third study also replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In all three studies, participants who felt more powerful were also more likely to see others as having more choice and, therefore, to blame them more when something went wrong — even if a reasonable explanation was given. As the team notes, this can’t just be because those in positions of power want to preserve their own position: in the first study, participants were asked to make a decision about someone completely unrelated to them and their own place in a social hierarchy. Instead, it may be that powerful people benefit psychologically from believing everyone’s position is related to choice, meaning they had reached their own position through merit and hard work.</p>



<p>Those in serious positions of power, such as policymakers and politicians, should therefore carefully consider how much choice people actually have in different situations. Are people “choosing” to remain on benefits, to use one issue highlighted by the team, or are they simply dealing with the constraints of their life and the world as best they can? If powerful people think more critically about when we really do have choice and when we don’t, it could avoid them unfairly blaming or punishing others.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size: 20px;">A century ago, the Milky Way galaxy was the entirety of the known universe. We had no idea what made the stars shine, and only one star — our own sun — was known to harbor any planets. Of those planets, humans had explored only one: Earth.</p>



<p>“The stellar universe, as we know it … is a flattened, watch-shaped organization of stars and nebulae,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-8-1921">astronomer Harlow Shapley wrote in <em>Science News Bulletin</em></a>, the earliest version of <em>Science News</em>, in August 1921 (<em>SN: 8/8/1921, p. 3</em>). That sparkling pocket watch was the Milky Way, and at the time Shapley wrote this, astronomers were just beginning to conceive that anything at all might lie beyond it.</p>



<p>Today, spacecraft have flown by every one of the solar system’s planets, taking close-ups of their wildly alien faces. The solar system, it turns out, contains a cornucopia of small rocky and icy bodies that have challenged the very definition of a planet. Thousands of planets have been spotted orbiting other stars, some of which may have the right conditions for life to thrive. And the Milky Way, we now know, is just one of billions of galaxies.</p>

<p>The last 100 years have brought a series of revolutions in astronomy, each one kicking Earth a bit farther from the center of things. Along the way, people have not exactly been receptive to these blows to our home planet’s centrality. In 1920, the question of whether there could be other “island universes” — galaxies — was the subject of the Great Debate between two astronomers. In the 1970s, when Mars was shown to have a pink sky, not blue, reporters booed. Their reaction “reflects our wish for Mars to be just like the Earth,” said astronomer Carl Sagan afterward. And in the 1990s, astronomers almost missed extrasolar planets hiding in their data because they had tailored their search techniques to find planets more like those in our own solar system.</p>



<p>But turning our focus from Earth has opened our minds to new possibilities, new universes, new places where life might exist. The next century of astronomy could bring better views of our cosmic origins and new strategies for finding worlds that other creatures call home.</p>



<p>The misperceptions of decades past suggest scientists should be careful when predicting just what we’ll find in the future.</p>



<p>“You learn a lot of humility in this business,” says planetary scientist Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson. “You always learn a lot more when you’re wrong than when you’re right.”</p>





<h4>More than the Milky Way</h4>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, conventional wisdom held that the Milky Way stood alone. It contained stars, sometimes organized in clusters, and fuzzy patches of light known as nebulae. That was about it.</p>



<p>Some nebulae had spiral structures, “appearing in the telescope like vast Fourth-of-July pinwheels,” as <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">described them in 1924</a>. In the 18th century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant had described nebulae as “higher universes,” or, “so to speak, Milky Ways.” But by the early 1900s, most astronomers thought that drawing that parallel was ridiculous.</p>



<p>“No competent thinker,” wrote historian of astronomy Agnes Clerke in 1890, can “maintain any single nebula to be a star system of coordinate rank with the Milky Way.”</p>



<p>By the 1920s, though, that view was already being challenged. As early as 1914, astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory in California argued that spiral nebulae are not part of the Milky Way, but rather “inconceivably distant galaxies of stars or separate stellar universes so remote that an entire galaxy becomes but an unresolved haze of light.”</p>



<p>Around the same time, Shapley, of Mount Wilson Observatory in California, began to prove that the Milky Way itself was inconceivably vast.</p>



<p>Shapley built on work by Henrietta Leavitt, one of a group of women “computers” at Harvard University who pored over photographic plates capturing the night sky. In studying photographs of the Magellanic Clouds, which we now know are two small galaxies that orbit the Milky Way, Leavitt noticed that certain stars varied in brightness over time, some of them in a peculiar way. “It is worthy of notice,” she wrote in 1908, that “the brighter variables have the longer periods.” In other words, brighter stars twinkled more slowly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="black and white image of Henrietta Leavitt sitting at a desk" class="wp-image-3101680" height="595" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_Leavitt.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101680">In the early 1900s, astronomer Henrietta Leavitt discovered a feature of certain stars, called Cepheid variables, that helped other astronomers measure cosmic distances. Those stars ultimately helped prove that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101680">Photo by Margaret Harwood, courtesy of AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives, Physics Today Collection, Shapley Collection</span></figure>



<p>That meant that these variable stars, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/blinking-stars-show-size-universe">Cepheids, could be used to estimate cosmic distances</a>. It’s hard to tell how far away a cosmic object truly is — bright-looking stars could be intrinsically dim but close, while faint-looking stars could be intrinsically bright but distant. But all the Cepheids within the same cloud should be roughly the same distance from Earth. That meant “their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light,” Leavitt wrote in 1912. To figure out any Cepheid’s true brightness, all an astronomer had to do was measure its twinkling speed. It was a short step from there to figuring out its distance.</p>



<p>Shapley put this fact to use just a few years later, measuring distances to Cepheids within globular clusters of stars to figure out the sun’s position in the Milky Way. To his surprise, the sun was not in the center of the galaxy but off to one side. The Milky Way’s starry disk was also about 10 times wider than previous astronomers had assumed: about 300,000 light-years across, according to his calculations. (He overshot a bit; modern astronomers think it’s somewhere between 120,000 and 200,000 light-years.)</p>



<p>He and Curtis took their opposing views to the public at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., in April 1920, in an event that became known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-great-debate-island-universe-milky-way">the Great Debate</a>. Each had 40 minutes to present their views on whether there is only one or several universes — what we now think of as galaxies.</p>



<p>Shapley, who was in his 30s and considered a rising star in the field, went first. A former journalist who reportedly was uncomfortable speaking to crowds, he read his argument from a typewritten script. He barely touched on the question of other universes, focusing instead on his new measurements of the Milky Way’s size. The implication was that the Milky Way was too large for other galaxies to make sense.</p>



<p>Curtis was an older, well-respected authority on spiral nebulae, as well as a gifted speaker. He argued for the then-standard view that the Milky Way was much smaller than Shapley supposed. But even a large Milky Way shouldn’t negate the possibility of other, equally large galaxies, he argued. The spectra of light coming from spiral nebulae was similar enough to that of the Milky Way that they could be similar objects, he maintained.</p>



<p>Both astronomers were partly right, and partly wrong.</p>



<h4>Galaxies come into view</h4>



<p>The Great Debate was resolved by a young astronomer named Edwin Hubble working at Mount Wilson. Hubble also used Leavitt’s Cepheid variable technique to measure cosmic distances, this time by finding the variable stars in the spiral nebulae themselves.</p>



<p>Hubble started observing the Andromeda nebula, one of the brightest nebulae on the sky, in the fall of 1923. He used Mount Wilson’s 60-inch telescope and its 100-inch telescope, then the world’s largest. Over the next year or so, he studied 35 Cepheids in Andromeda and a different nebula called Triangulum. Their periods were long enough that the nebulae had to be on the order of a million light-years away for the stars to appear so faint. (We now know it’s more like 2.5 million light-years to Andromeda and 2.7 million to Triangulum.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="black and white image of Edwin Hubble sitting at a desk" class="wp-image-3101676" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_inline_hubble_edwin_from-print.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101676">Astronomer Edwin Hubble, shown here holding a drawing of a galaxy, proved that there are other galaxies outside of the Milky Way.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101676">Hale Observatories, courtesy of AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives</span></figure>



<p>“Measuring the distance to Andromeda was a big deal because it was the first evidence that there are galaxies beyond our own,” says astronomer Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle. “It changed what we thought of as the shape of our universe.”</p>



<p>A few hints that the Milky Way was not alone had cropped up before that, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/universe-expands-when-astronomer-discovers-other-stellar-systems">Hubble’s finding clinched it</a>. Even if the Milky Way was as big as Shapley claimed, Andromeda lay outside its borders. When Shapley received Hubble’s paper, he reportedly said, “Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.”</p>



<p><em>Science News Letter</em> reported Hubble’s finding under the headline “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">Sky Pinwheels Are Stellar Universes 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Miles Away</a>” in December 1924 (<em>SN: 12/6/24, p. 2</em>).</p>



<p>“It seems probable that many of the smaller spiral nebulae are still more remote and appear smaller on this account,” the story quotes Hubble as saying. “The portion of the universe within the range of our investigation consists of vast numbers of stellar galaxies comparable to our own, scattered about through nearly empty space and separated from one another by distances of inconceivable magnitude.” Here at last was the modern view of the universe.</p>



<p>By the end of the decade, Hubble had not only shown that the spiral nebulae were “island universes,” he also had begun to classify different galaxy types and think about how they evolved over time. What’s more, he showed that galaxies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nebulae-hold-skys-speed-record">were flying away from each other</a> at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientist-says-universe-actually-exploding">the universe was expanding</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, astronomers knew that the universe was dotted with billions of galaxies of all shapes and sizes. In April 1990, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/antenna-jam-delays-hubbles-first-light">NASA launched</a> the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/space-telescope-saga-setbacks">first optical space telescope</a> into Earth’s orbit, giving the world a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubble-finally-has-stars-its-eyes">new perspective on space</a>.</p>



<p>“Instead of these blurry blobs from even the best mountaintop observatories on our planet,” says planetary scientist Jim Bell of Arizona State University in Tempe, “all of a sudden the entire realm of solar system, galaxy, extragalactic … was opened up by getting above the atmosphere.”</p>



<p>NASA named the telescope after the scientist who opened astronomers’ minds to the existence of such a universe: the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-celebrating-hubbles-past-focus-its-future">images it has captured over 30 years</a> of operations — star clusters, galaxies and nebulae — are so iconic they are printed on everything from socks and coffee mugs to high fashion runway designs. The telescope itself was recently immortalized in Lego form.</p>



<p>“It’s the one that literally everyone has heard of,” says Levesque. Most people today think Hubble was “the guy who built the telescope.”</p>



<p>One image from early on in the space telescope’s tenure stands out. In December 1995, the telescope’s director, Robert Williams, decided to train the observatory on a tiny, dark patch of sky near the handle of the Big Dipper for 10 consecutive days. The resulting portrait of this featureless bit of sky revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubbles-deep-view-universe">thousands of previously unknown galaxies</a> sending their light from farther away than astronomers had ever seen before (<em>SN: 1/20/96, p. 36</em>). The universe as Edwin Hubble had imagined it, chock-full of island universes, was captured in one hard look.</p>



<p>As for Henrietta Leavitt, she missed out on the recognition she deserved for helping knock the Milky Way from its central perch. A Swedish mathematician wrote to her in 1925 saying that her work “has impressed me so deeply that I feel seriously inclined to nominate you to the Nobel Prize in physics for 1926.” He received a reply from Shapley, by then director of the Harvard College Observatory: Leavitt had died four years earlier.</p>

<h3>Bizarre beauties</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, astronomer Halton Arp proposed that researchers use the weirdest-looking galaxies as natural experiments to learn what gives a galaxy its shape. To help researchers figure out what makes a galaxy spiral, blobby or some other shape, Arp published the 1966 <em>Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies</em>, a compilation of 338 galaxies sorted by appearance.</p>



<p>Arp’s categories were spiral, elliptical, neither spiral nor elliptical, double and none of the above. At the time, some of the galaxies had no names or designations, and are still best known by their Arp numbers, like Arp 273 and Arp 147.</p>



<p>Despite their diversity, most of the peculiar galaxies are now thought to be going through a merger or interacting with another galaxy. But Arp never bought that explanation. He claimed for years that galaxies’ shapes come from material ejected from their luminous cores. Here are six of the most beautiful and bizarre galaxies, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, which offer much greater detail than Arp had access to half a century ago. — <em>Lisa Grossman</em></p>

<h4>Steps to Mars</h4>



<p>The first liquid-fueled rockets, precursors to the ones that later carried robots and people into space, launched in the 1920s. A century later, robots have flown past, orbited or landed on every planetary body that was known in 1920, and a few that weren’t. People have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">walked on the moon</a> and have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-twins-study-reveals-effects-space-scott-kelly-health">lived in space</a> for more than a year at a time. And serious talks about sending people to Mars are in the works.</p>



<p>NASA used to explore other worlds in a clear order, first observing with telescopes and then carrying out increasingly complex missions: flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers, then people and sample returns. “We’ve taken that entire progression on the moon, in [the last] century,” Bell says. “Sometime in this new century, we’ll add Mars to that list. All the rest of the solar system, we’ve got large chunks of that matrix checked off.”</p>



<p>After the Soviet Union <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/compare-moon-programs">launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957</a>, space launches came fast and furious. Many were demonstrations of political and military might. But a lot of them had scientific merit, too. The Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/1959-science-review">photographed the farside of the moon</a> in 1959 — shortly after NASA’s founding. Spacecraft flew past <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/still-mystery">Venus</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-closer-look-nearby-world">Mars</a> in the 1960s, sending back the first closeup data on their alien atmospheres and surfaces.</p>



<p>That same decade, humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">landed on the moon</a> and<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ancient-moon-samples-exhilarate-selenologists"> brought back rocks</a>, opening a wide and detailed window into the history of the solar system. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">lunar samples from the Apollo missions</a> gave scientists a way to figure out how old planetary surfaces are around the solar system, taught us that the entire inner solar system was bombarded with impacts in its youth and gave us an origin story for the moon (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>“Until we started the space program, we really had no idea what the geology was on other places,” says Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute. “Early in the century, they were still debating whether the craters on the moon were impact craters or volcanic calderas. Even right there in our own backyard, we didn’t know what was going on.”</p>



<p>And extraterrestrial geology was surprising. Without meaning to, planetary scientists had based a lot of their expectations for other worlds on the Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/june-5-1976">cover of <em>Science News</em> from June 1976</a>, the month before NASA’s Viking 1 lander became the first long-lived spacecraft to land softly on Mars, showed Mars with a Cheez Whiz–colored desert under a clear blue sky. In the sleep-deprived rush to release the first color images sent back by Viking 1, scientists processed the image to produce a blue sky there, too.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="cover of Science News magazine with an illustration of Viking 1 on Mars" class="wp-image-3101681" height="912" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_mars-cover.jpg" width="680" />Before NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft landed on Mars in July 1976, <em>Science News</em> and others envisioned the Red Planet with a blue sky. Mars’ sky is actually a dusty yellowish-pink.</figure></div>



<p>But the day after the landing, James Pollack of the imaging team told reporters that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/week-mars">Martian sky was actually pink</a>, probably thanks to scattered light from dust particles suspended in the air.</p>



<p>“When we found the sky of Mars to be a kind of pinkish-yellow rather than the blue which had erroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a chorus of good-natured boos from the assembled reporters,” Sagan later wrote in the introduction to his popular book <em>Cosmos</em>. “They wanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth.”</p>



<p>Still, the Viking 1 and 2 landings brought Mars down to Earth, so to speak. “Mars had become a place,” Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen said in an interview for a NASA historical project published in 1984. “It went from a word, an abstract thought, to a real place.”</p>



<p>In some ways, the Viking landers’ views of Mars were disappointing. The mission’s central goal was explicitly to search for microbial life. It was “a long shot,” journalist Janet L. Hopson wrote <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/martian-life-odds-and-oddities">in <em>Science News</em> in June 1976</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/76, p. 374</em>). But “even if no signs of life appear, [biologists] stand to gain their first real perspective on terrestrial biochemistry, life origins and evolution.”</p>



<p>The results of the Viking mission’s life-detection experiments were inconclusive, a finding almost worse than a true negative.</p>



<p>NASA subsequently pulled back from seeking life directly. The next 45 years of Mars missions searched for signs of past water, potentially habitable environments and organic molecules, instead of living organisms. All of those features turned up in data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-spirit-still-running-only-place">Spirit</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-dead">Opportunity</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-weighed-mountain-its-climbing">Curiosity</a> rovers in the 2000s and 2010s.</p>



<p>Now, NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover</a>, which landed in February 2021, is hunting for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">signs of ancient microbial life</a>. The rover will cache rock samples that a future mission will bring back to Earth. And the joint Russian and European space agencies’ ExoMars rover — named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist whose work was central to discovering DNA’s structure — aims to seek molecular signatures of life on Mars and just below the surface after it launches in 2022.</p>



<p>Sagan predicted in 1973 that if he had been born 50 years in the future, the search for life on Mars would have already been completed. Today, 48 years later, we’re still looking.</p>

<h4>Exotic moons</h4>



<p>The year after the Vikings landed on Mars, another pair of spacecraft launched to check almost the entire rest of the solar system off scientists’ must-see list. Astronomers realized that in 1977, the planets would line up in such a way that a spacecraft launched that year could reach Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune one by one, stealing a little angular momentum from each world as it went along. The mission was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/voyager-hard-start-long-road">dubbed Voyager</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/77, p. 132</em>).</p>



<p>“There’s never been anything like it, and there never will be again,” says Bell, of Arizona State. “It was comparable to the voyages of Magellan or Darwin or Lewis and Clark. Just an absolutely profound mission of discovery that completely changed the landscape of planetary science in this century.”</p>



<p>Voyager’s views of the outer solar system forced scientists to think outside of the “Earth box,” says Hansen, who worked on the mission. “The Voyager imaging team, bless their hearts, they would make predictions and then they’d be wrong,” she says. “And we would learn something.”</p>



<p>Hansen recalls chatting with a member of the imaging team when the spacecraft was approaching Jupiter and its dozens of moons. “He said, ‘Candy, we will see craters on [moons] Io and Europa, because we know from the density that those are rocky worlds. But not on Ganymede and Callisto, because those are ice,’ ” she recalls. Instead, the images showed Ganymede and Callisto were covered in craters. “That was an aha moment — ice is going to act like rock at those temperatures.” Meanwhile, ocean-swathed Europa and molten Io had almost no craters.</p>



<p>The moons of Jupiter presented “a whole, previously unimagined family of exotic worlds, each radically different not only from its companions, but also from everything else in the planet-watcher’s experience,” journalist Jonathan Eberhart wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire"><em>Science News</em> in April 1980</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/80, p. 251</em>).</p>



<p>Before 1979, Earth was the only geologically active, rocky world scientists knew about. But Voyager changed that view, too. A member of Voyager’s optical navigation team, Linda Morabito, spotted an odd, mushroom-shaped feature extending off the edge of Io while she was trying to plot the spacecraft’s position on March 9, 1979. She consulted with the science team, and they soon realized they were looking at a gigantic volcanic plume. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire">Io was erupting</a> in real time.</p>



<p>Three planetary scientists had predicted Io’s fire before the plumes were discovered. The three suggested the moon was heated by a gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter and one or two of its other moons, Europa and Ganymede.</p>



<p>But most of the planetary science community was stunned. “We take gravity for granted here. It keeps our feet on the ground,” Hansen says. “But gravity molds and shapes so many things in so many unexpected ways.”</p>



<p>Voyager and subsequent missions to the outer planets, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/close-encounter-galileo-eyes-io">Galileo at Jupiter</a> in the 1990s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturns-rings-panoramic-perspective">Cassini at Saturn</a> in the 2000s, transformed our view of the solar system in another profound way. They revealed several surprising parts of the solar system where life might exist today.</p>



<p>Voyager hinted that Europa might have a liquid water ocean beneath an icy shell. Galileo strengthened that idea, and suggested the ocean might be salty and have contact with the moon’s rocky core, which could provide chemical nutrients for microbial life. NASA is now developing a mission to fly past Europa. “I will not be surprised if life is somehow discovered on Europa in my lifetime, or in this century,” Bell says.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, scientists realized that the tiny moon Enceladus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">vents dramatic plumes</a> of water vapor, dust and ice crystals into space from a hidden subsurface sea. That moon also looks like a good place for life.</p>



<p>If the last century of exploring the solar system was about coming to grips with alien geology, Hansen says, this coming century is going to be about oceanography — getting a grip on the strange seas in our own solar system.</p>



<p>“I think that’s going to shape a lot of the research going forward,” Hansen says. Now that it’s clear these moons have oceans, researchers will ask if they are habitable, and eventually, if they are inhabited.</p>



<h4>Exoplanets detected</h4>



<p>The first planet spotted outside our solar system — an exoplanet — was so different from anything in our solar system that astronomers weren’t hunting for anything like it.</p>



<p>“Knowing that there are actually planets around other stars now seems so trivial to say,” says exoplanet observer Debra Fischer of Yale University. “But we had arguments in 1995 about whether other stars have planets.”</p>



<p>So when astronomer Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory turned his spectrograph on the sky in April 1994, he kept quiet about his hopes of finding true exoplanets. He was more likely to find brown dwarfs, failed stars that never grew massive enough to burn hydrogen.</p>



<p>His instrument used a clever new way to hunt for other worlds, called the radial velocity technique. Previous exoplanet hunters had looked directly for a star’s motion in response to the gravity of an orbiting planet, watching to see if the star would move back and forth in the sky. That technique had led to several planetary claims, even dating back to 1855, but none of them had held up. Those motions are tiny; Jupiter’s influence moves the sun by just 12 meters per second.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Exoplanet detections</h3>



<p>Astronomers have hunted exoplanets with several techniques, some better than others. The earliest claimed exoplanet detections used the astrometry method, but almost none of them held up. Success came with the radial velocity method in the 1990s. But the transit method has proved most prolific. </p>

<p>Instead, Mayor and others studied a shift in the wavelength of starlight as a star moved to and fro. As a star approaches us, the light shifts to shorter, or bluer, wavelengths; as it moves away, the light grows redder. Calculating the velocity of a star’s back-and-forth motion, astronomers could figure out the minimum mass and length of the year of whatever was tugging that star.</p>



<p>The shifts Mayor was looking for were still minuscule. The search was considered futile, and fringe — like looking for little green men. So astronomers who explicitly claimed to be searching for planets had a hard time scheduling observations at telescopes. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, were considered legitimate science, and would be easier to detect.</p>



<p>So the world was astounded when, in October 1995, Mayor and his student Didier Queloz reported strong evidence not of a brown dwarf, but of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">a true planet orbiting the sunlike star 51 Pegasi</a>, about 50 light-years from our solar system.</p>



<p>The new planet was weird. It seemed to be about half the mass of Jupiter, too puny to be a brown dwarf. But it orbited the star once every 4.23 Earth days, putting it incredibly close to its star. There’s nothing like that in our solar system, and astronomers had no idea how it could exist.</p>



<p>“The news flashed through the astronomical community like a lightning bolt,” wrote journalist Ron Cowen in <em>Science News</em>, in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">first</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/searching-other-worlds">three</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-emerge-dark">stories</a> on the new planet he would write within a month (<em>SN: 10/21/95, p. 260</em>).</p>



<p>51 Peg b, as it came to be known, launched a new era. “It means planets exist around other sunlike stars, we can find them, and they might be the exciting ones,” says Yale anthropologist Lisa Messeri, who has studied how astronomers create worlds out of pixels and spectra. “Firsts are exciting because they promise there will be seconds and thirds and fourths.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Big surprise </h3>



<p>The first planet found orbiting a star similar to our sun fit nobody’s mold. Dubbed a “hot Jupiter,” 51 Pegasi b is bigger than Jupiter, but 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun (Earth is one astronomical unit, AU, or 150 million kilometers from the sun). 51 Pegasi b circles its star in four days; Earth’s orbit is a lengthier 365 days.</p>



<h6 class="has-text-align-center">A tight orbit for a large planet</h6>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="diagram showing the size and distance of 51 Pegasi b compared to Earth" class="wp-image-3101679" height="251" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_inline_pegb.png" width="680" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3101679">C. Chang</span></figure>

</div>



<p>The search was on. A group from San Francisco quickly found two more planets hiding in data the researchers hadn’t finished analyzing yet. Those next two planets, 70 Vir b and 47 UMa b, were also more massive and closer to their stars than expected.</p>



<p>The existence of these three worlds, which were named hot Jupiters because their close-in orbits should make them sizzle, upended the paradigm for what a planet could be like. Clearly, our solar system was not the template for the universe.</p>



<p>Yet for a few years after 51 Peg b was announced, astronomers debated whether the planet was really there. Maybe the star’s apparent back-and-forth was just its outer atmosphere breathing in and out. Those debates waned as more planets were discovered, but it took a new technique to really convince everyone.</p>



<p>Astronomers had predicted at least back to the 1850s that some planets would pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. As it crossed, or transited, the face of its star, a planet could reveal its presence by blocking a little bit of the star’s light.</p>



<p>But if other solar systems are like ours, transits would be incredibly difficult to detect. Our planets are too small and too far from the sun to cast a large shadow. Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, should block way more of a star’s light than any planets in our solar system. With the discovery of 51 Peg b, transits seemed not only possible to detect, but almost easy.</p>



<p>The first transiting extrasolar planet revealed itself in 1999, when then-Harvard graduate student David Charbonneau drove to Colorado to do his thesis work with astronomer Tim Brown. Brown had built a tiny telescope on a friend’s farm north of Boulder, setting up the computers in a repurposed turkey coop, to search for transiting planets. By the time Charbonneau arrived, however, the farm had been sold and the telescope relocated to a lab site.</p>



<p>To practice the technique, Charbonneau aimed Brown’s telescope at a star, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-out-shadows">called HD 209458</a>, that already had a suspected planet. The star’s light dimmed by about 1 percent, and then it shone bright again. That was a clear sign of a planet about 32 percent wider than Jupiter.</p>



<p>That discovery ended all doubts about the existence of exoplanets, says Fischer, who had worked with the exoplanet-hunting group in San Francisco. “It happened like that,” Fischer says, with a finger snap. The combined size and mass of the planet unambiguously ruled out brown dwarfs or other exotic explanations. “It walks like a Jupiter, talks like a Jupiter, it’s a Jupiter.”</p>



<p>There was another advantage to the transit method: It can show the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/craft-probes-alien-planets-atmosphere">composition of a planet’s atmosphere</a>. Planets detected by the wobble technique were “little more than phantoms,” Cowen wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/passages"><em>Science News</em> in 2007</a>. They were too small to be seen, and too close to the star to be photographed directly.</p>



<p>“Everyone had assumed that if you wanted to [detect] the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, you’d have to image it,” Charbonneau told <em>Science News</em>. But starlight filtering through a transiting planet’s sky could reveal what gases surround the alien world without the need for a snapshot.</p>



<h4>Hunt for habitable planets</h4>



<p>Transits soon overtook wobbles as the most fruitful planet-finding strategy. That was mostly thanks to the launch of NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-space-telescope-finds-its-first-extrasolar-planets">Kepler space telescope</a> in March 2009.</p>



<p>Kepler’s mission was explicitly about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-superearths">finding other Earths</a>. For nearly four years, the telescope stared at 170,000 stars in a single patch of sky to catch as many transiting planets as it could. In particular, its operators were hoping for Earth-sized planets in Earthlike orbits around sunlike stars — places where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunt-habitable-planets">life could conceivably exist</a>.</p>



<p>The years that followed were a boom time for planet finders. By the end of its nearly 10-year run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler had confirmed almost 2,700 planets</a> and thousands more potential planets. Findings went beyond the hot Jupiters to worlds the size of Earth and planets in the “habitable zone,” where temperatures could be right for liquid water.</p>



<p>Discoveries came so quickly that a single new world stopped being a news story. Kepler’s data shifted from revealing new worlds one by one to taking an exoplanet census. It showed that hot Jupiters are not actually the most common type of planet; they were just the easiest ones to spot. The most common type makes no appearance in our solar system: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-exoplanets-habitable-earth-neptune">worlds between the size of Earth and Neptune</a>, which may be rocky super-Earths or gaseous mini-Neptunes.</p>



<p>And Kepler revealed that there are more planets in the galaxy than stars. Every one of the billions and billions of stars in the Milky Way should have at least one world in its orbit.</p>



<p>But the telescope never really achieved the goal of finding another Earth. Kepler required three transits to confirm a world’s existence. That means the telescope had to stare for at least three years to find a planet orbiting at Earth’s exact distance.</p>



<p>By 2013, after four years of observing, half of Kepler’s stabilizing reaction wheels had failed. The telescope couldn’t maintain its unblinking view of the same part of the sky. Mission scientists cleverly reprogrammed the telescope to look at other stars for shorter spans of time. But most of the planets found there orbited closer to their stars than Earth does, meaning they couldn’t be Earth twins.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler ran out of fuel in 2018</a>, with no true Earth analog in sight.</p>



<p>Messeri recalls an exoplanet conference at MIT in 2011 where a lot of the conversation was about finding a twin of Earth.</p>



<p>“It was a peak of excitement — maybe we’re going to find this planet in the next three years, or five years. It felt close,” she says. “What’s interesting is, in the 10 years since then, it still feels that close.”</p>



<p>But astronomers had already realized they might not need a true Earth analog to find a planet where life could exist. Rocky worlds orbiting smaller, dimmer stars than the sun are easier to find, and might be just as friendly to life.</p>



<p>Charbonneau again was ahead of the curve, having started a program called MEarth in 2008 to hunt for habitable planets around puny M dwarf stars using eight small telescopes in Arizona (plus another eight in Chile that were added in 2014). Within six months, Charbonneau and colleagues had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-exotic-water-world">found a super-Earth dubbed GJ 1214b</a> that is probably a water world — maybe a bit too wet for life.</p>



<p>The European Southern Observatory started the TRAPPIST, for TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope, survey from La Silla, Chile, in 2010. Another telescope, at Oukaïmeden Observatory in Morocco, came online to search for planets orbiting Northern Hemisphere stars in 2016. Among that survey’s discoveries is the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star">TRAPPIST-1 system</a> of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single M dwarf star, three of which might be in the habitable zone (<em>SN: 3/18/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="illustration of the TRAPPIST-1 planet system" class="wp-image-3101682" height="515" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073121_otherworlds_trappist.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101682">The star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven planets (shown in an artist’s illustration) that all probably have a rocky composition. At least three of the planets could have temperatures that are good for life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101682">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figure>



<p>NASA’s successor to Kepler, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/launch-tess-nasa-boost-search-exoplanets">TESS</a>, or Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, has been scanning the entire sky since April 2018 for small planets orbiting bright nearby stars, including M dwarfs. It spotted more than 2,200 potential planets in its<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tess-space-telescope-has-spotted-its-first-exoplanet"> first full-sky scan</a>, scientists announced in March 2021.</p>



<p>These days, astronomers are joining up with scientists across disciplines, from planetary scientists who study hypothetical exoplanet geology to microbiologists and chemists who think about what kinds of aliens could live on those planets and how to detect those life-forms. That’s a big shift from even 10 years ago, Messeri says. In the early 2010s, no one was talking about life.</p>



<p>“You weren’t allowed to say that,” she says. “Astronomers would whisper it to me during fieldwork, but this was not a search for aliens.”</p>



<p>Exoplanet astronomy is on firmer ground now. Its leading figures have won MacArthur “genius” grants. Pioneer planet finders Mayor and Queloz <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-2019-early-universe-cosmic-microwave-exoplanets">won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics</a>. The work is no longer hidden away in conferences that are actually about stars. “It doesn’t have to legitimize itself anymore,” Messeri says. “It’s a real science.”</p>



<p>The promise that transiting planets can reveal the contents of their alien atmospheres may soon be fulfilled. NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> may launch this year, after many years of delays. One of its first tasks will be to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets, including those of TRAPPIST-1.</p>



<p>If anything is alive on those absolutely alien, unearthly worlds, maybe the next century will bring it to light.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xerxes-blue-butterfly-first-human-caused-us-insect-extinction">This butterfly is the first U.S. insect known to go extinct because of people</a></h4>

<p>It’s been roughly 80 years since the Xerces blue butterfly was last spotted flitting about on pastel wings across coastal California sand dunes. But scientists are still learning about the insect.</p>



<p>New research on DNA from a nearly century-old museum specimen shows that the butterfly was a distinct species. What’s more, that finding means that the Xerces blue butterfly (<em>Glaucopsyche xerces</em>) is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0123">the first U.S. insect species known to go extinct because of humans</a>, researchers report July 21 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. </p>



<p>The butterfly used to live only on the San Francisco Peninsula. But by the early 1940s, less than a century after its formal scientific description in the 1850s, the gossamer-winged butterfly had vanished. Its rapid disappearance is attributed to the loss of habitat and native plant food as a result of urban development and, possibly, an influx of invasive ants likely spread though the shipment of goods. </p>



<p>But it’s long been unclear if the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species, or simply an isolated population of another, more widespread species of blue butterfly, says Corrie Moreau, an entomologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>To find out, Moreau and colleagues turned to a 93-year-old Xerces specimen housed at Chicago’s Field Museum, extracting DNA from a tiny bit of the insect’s tissue. Despite the DNA being degraded from age, the team could compare selected Xerces genes with those of other closely related blue butterflies. The researchers also compared the genomes, or genetic instruction books, of the insects’ mitochondria — cellular structures involved in energy production that have their own set of DNA. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="a photo of Xerces blue butterfly specimens pinned in boxes under glass" class="wp-image-3101721" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071921_JB_butterfly_inline.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101721">Scientists analyzed DNA from a specimen in the collection of Xerces blue butterflies (shown) at Chicago’s Field Museum to reveal that the extinct insect was a distinct species.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101721">Field Museum</span></figure>



<p>Using the genes and the “mitogenomes,” the researchers crafted an evolutionary tree, showing how all of the butterfly species are related to each other. The extinct Xerces blue butterfly was genetically distinct, thus warranting classification as a species, the team found. </p>



<p>“We sort of lost a piece of the biodiversity puzzle that made up the tapestry of the San Francisco Bay area when this species was driven to extinction,” Moreau says.</p>





<p>Akito Kawahara, a lepidopterist at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville not involved with the study, thinks the results are “fairly convincing” that the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species.</p>



<p>The butterfly is considered a candidate for resurrection, Moreau says, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/resurrecting-extinct-species-raises-ethical-questions">extinct species are brought back via cloning</a> or other genetic manipulations (<em>SN: 10/20/17</em>). But she cautions against it. “Maybe we should spend that time and energy and money on ensuring that we protect the blues that are already endangered that we know about,” she says.</p>





<p>One of these insects is the endangered El Segundo blue (<em>Euphilotes battoides allyni</em>), native to the Los Angeles area. It and other butterfly populations are increasingly imperiled by numerous threats, such as climate change, land-use changes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-piles-popular-pesticides-link-pollinator-problems">pesticide use</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/17/16</em>).</p>



<p>For Felix Grewe, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum, the new finding illustrates why long-term museum collections are so important: Specimens’ true utility may not be clear for many years. After all, the genetic techniques used in the study to illuminate the Xerces blue butterfly’s true identity didn’t exist when the insect went extinct.</p>



<p>“You don’t know what technology there [will be] 100 years from now,” Grewe says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite the fact that psychology students are more likely to be women than men, and that women outnumber men in the clinical psychology workforce, women in psychology <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620952789">publish less</a>, receive fewer citations, and are underrepresented at senior positions within university departments. This juxtaposition of over and underrepresentation poses an interesting question about how people perceive gender roles within the field.</p>



<p>It’s this question Guy A. Boysen and team explore <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1921682?src=">in a new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Social Psychology</em>. They find that people associate psychology more strongly with femininity than masculinity — and that this may affect how men and women feel about working or studying within the field.</p>



<span id="more-42933"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants filling in surveys online were asked what percentage of students studying psychology at university level were women, and what percentage of psychologists were women. The results showed that people see psychology as a more women-heavy profession and discipline, with participants estimating that 62% of psychology students and 59% of psychologists are women.</p>



<p>A second study looked more directly at people’s perceptions of how “feminine” or “masculine” psychology is as a field. Both online participants and undergraduate students rated various university degrees and careers on a scale from “extremely feminine” to “extremely masculine”. The breadth of majors and careers listed were included due to their association with particular gendered stereotypes — engineering, for example, is stereotypically assumed to be a masculine job while nursing is thought to be feminine.</p>



<p>A psychology major was considered by both groups to be slightly more feminine than masculine, and was rated as significantly more feminine than typically “masculine” subjects like engineering, business, and maths (though majors like nursing and education were considered more feminine than psychology). Similarly, while a career in psychology was seen as less feminine than teaching or nursing, it was considered significantly more feminine than being a neuroscientist, historian, doctor, or business person.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants were asked to imagine a stereotypical person in one of three subjects at university: engineering, nursing, or psychology. After being shown stereotypically masculine and feminine traits — for example “gentle” for feminine or “egotistical” for masculine — participants rated how well each word described a person studying the subject they had been assigned.</p>



<p>As expected, participants tended to believe that both positive and negative masculine traits better described engineering students than psychology students, while positive feminine traits better described psychology students than engineers. The only difference between nursing and psychology was in positive masculine traits: these were believed to better suit nursing majors than psychology students. This suggests that psychology, like nursing, is largely considered to be a “feminine” subject.</p>



<p>In a fourth study, participants indicated how satisfied they believed men and women would be with a career in psychology. Participants who read that psychology students were 75% women and 25% men rated men’s satisfaction as significantly lower than women’s. But those who read there was an equal percentage of women and men didn’t show any difference in ratings of men’s and women’s satisfaction. A similar follow-up part of the study also found that men were seen as less likely to have their needs met by a career in psychology than women.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggested that psychology is considered to be significantly more feminine than it is masculine, and that people assume men’s needs may therefore not be met by it as a subject of study or a career.      </p>



<p>But is this actually true? Future research could look at how men and women in psychology feel themselves — just because a field is perceived to be “feminine” doesn’t mean that men will necessarily be less satisfied or fulfilled when working within it. Whether men are actually put off careers in psychology is a different question that could be explored in more depth.</p>



<p>It’s also important to go back to the fact of the overrepresentation of men in certain positions. If psychology is seen as a “feminine” occupation, and if women outnumber men, why do men <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/gender-composition/task-force-report.pdf">dominate positions of power</a>? Looking at ways for everyone to succeed and feel comfortable in psychology is crucial.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-microbes-habitability-aliens-extraterrestrial">Missing Antarctic microbes raise thorny questions about the search for aliens</a></h4>

<p>Even in the harshest environments, microbes always seem to get by. They thrive everywhere from boiling-hot seafloor hydrothermal vents to high on Mt. Everest. Clumps of microbial cells have even been found clinging to the hull of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bacteria-band-together-survival-years-astrobiology">International Space Station</a> (<em>SN: 08/26/20</em>). </p>



<p>There was no reason for microbial ecologist Noah Fierer to expect that the 204 soil samples he and colleagues had collected near Antarctica’s Shackleton Glacier would be any different. A spoonful of typical soil could easily contain billions of microbes, and Antarctic soils from other regions host at least a few thousand per gram. So he assumed that all of his samples would host at least some life, even though the air around Shackleton Glacier is so cold and so arid that Fierer often left his damp laundry outside to freeze-dry.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, some of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JG006052">coldest, driest soils didn’t seem to be inhabited by microbes</a> at all, he and colleagues report in the June <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</em>. To Fierer’s knowledge, this is the first time that scientists have found soils that don’t seem to support any kind of microbial life.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that exceedingly cold and arid conditions might place a hard limit on microbial habitability. The results also raise questions about how negative scientific results should be interpreted, especially in the search for life on other planets. “The challenge comes back to this sort of philosophical [question], how do you prove a negative?” Fierer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Noah Fierer" class="wp-image-3101491" height="269" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101491">Noah Fierer and colleagues found soil samples from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica that did not have traces of life, an unexpected observation since samples from the continent typically contain thousands of microbes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101491">Courtesy of N. Fierer</span></figure>



<p>Proving a negative result is notoriously difficult. No measurement is perfectly sensitive, which means there’s always a possibility that a well-executed experiment will fail to detect something that is actually there. It took years of experiments based on multiple, independent methods before Fierer of the University of Colorado Boulder and his collaborator Nick Dragone, finally felt confident enough to announce that they’d found seemingly microbe-free soils. And the scientists intentionally stated only that they were unable to detect life in their samples, not that the soils were naturally sterile. “We can’t say the soils are sterile. Nobody can say that,” Fierer says. “That’s a never-ending quest. There’s always another method or a variant of a method that you could try.”</p>



<p>Polar microbiologist Jeff Bowman sees the findings as an indication that current technology can’t detect very low levels of life, which can lead to false-negative results. “Certainly, there were things there,” says Bowman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. “This is Earth. This is an environment that is massively contaminated with life.” </p>



<p>Even if there were a few undetected microbes in the soil, said Dragone, that wouldn’t undermine his team’s evidence that cold and aridity pose a serious challenge to life. “It’s the combination of multiple very challenging environmental conditions that restricts life more than just one acting by itself,” says Dragone. “It’s a very different sort of restriction than, say, just high temperature.”</p>



<p>As scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">search for evidence of life beyond Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>), they will inevitably be forced to walk the line between evidence of absence and absence of evidence. “What we’re trying to do on Mars is kind of the reverse of what we’ve tried to do on Earth,” says polar microbiologist Lyle Whyte of McGill University in Montreal. On Earth, claiming that an environment is lifeless is a tough scientific sell. On Mars, it will be the other way around.</p>

<p>Winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is unfriendly to pikas. Temperatures across the barren, windy highlands routinely dip below –30° Celsius, and the grass that typically sustains the rabbitlike mammals becomes dry and brittle. It would seem the perfect time for these critters to hibernate, or subsist on stores of grass in burrows to stay warm, like the North American pika. </p>



<p>Instead, plateau pika (<em>Ochotona curzoniae</em>) continue foraging in winter, but <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100707118">reduce their metabolism by about 30 percent</a> to conserve energy, researchers report July 19 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> Some pikas also resort to unusual rations: yak poop.</p>



<p>Camera data from four sites confirmed that pikas regularly brave the cold to forage. “Clearly they’re doing something fancy with their metabolism that’s not hibernation,” says John Speakman, an ecophysiologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p>



<p>Speakman and colleagues measured daily energy expenditure of 156 plateau pikas in summer and winter, and implanted 27 animals with temperature sensors. While many nonhibernating animals keep warm in winter by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/eight-ways-animals-survive-winter">using more energy</a>, these pikas did the opposite (<em>SN: 1/22/14</em>). On average, pikas reduced their metabolism by 29.7 percent, in part by cooling their bodies a couple degrees overnight. The animals were also less active, relative to summertime levels.</p>





<p>But at sites with yaks, pikas were more abundant but even less active. That puzzled the researchers “until we found a sort of half-eaten yak turd in one of the burrows,” Speakman says. Eating excrement can cause sickness. But with few options, yak poop could be an abundant, easily digestible meal that “massively reduces the amount of time [pikas] need to spend on the surface,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers caught pikas scarfing scat on video, and DNA evidence from stomach contents solidified that this behavior is common. Whether dining on dung has downsides remains to be seen, but clearly, not being too picky pays off for pika.   </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/kp4x1NIC-3A/">Engaging with article metrics: own your impact narrative</a></h4>

<p>As <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/a-farewell-to-alm-but-not-to-article-level-metrics/">we wrote back in March</a>, PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of metrics at the article level. The move to article-level metrics (often known as altmetrics) is “<a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>defined</em></a><em> by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed.” </em></p>



<p>Article-level metrics/altmetrics have always been presented as alternatives to solely relying on traditional shorthand assessments like total citation counts and the reductive Journal Impact Factor. Hopefully, a <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/mwtang/ifuse.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">detailed critique</a> of the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/"> perils and misuse</a> of journal-level impact metrics is not needed in this day and age, suffice to repeat that it is unscientific to convey more credit and reward to one researcher’s article over another’s based solely upon the Journal Impact Factor of the venue of publication. </p>



<p>We’re hopeful that culture is changing, thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://sfdora.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">DORA</a> and other organizations advocating, and now providing <a href="https://sfdora.org/dora-case-studies/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">concrete guidance</a>, for the responsible use of metrics in research assessment. Also, some funders, like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), are <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/biomedical-research/investigator-program/review" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">making explicit</a> how they review their HHMI Investigators, clearly encouraging them to tell the full story of their impact beyond a simple publication record.  </p>



<p>Researchers like you can help. The purpose of this post is to empower researchers to engage with a variety of accessible altmetrics, and signals of rigorous research practice, to define your research article’s unique “impact narrative” and more effectively showcase its strengths. </p>



<h3><strong>What metrics and signals can articles offer?</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing and highlighting your article-level metrics helps<strong> </strong>facilitate and normalize more appropriate assessment. When relying on metrics to describe your work, use detailed metrics that are <strong>specific to your article </strong>such as:</p>



<ul><li>Citations over time</li><li>Usage over time</li><li>Attention (beyond citations) over time (e.g. from news outlets, policies, social media) often measured as “altmetrics”</li></ul>



<p>The data displayed on PLOS articles’ “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metrics</a>” tab showcases how many times the article has been viewed, cited, saved, and discussed, and clicking on any of the sections opens up the details (e.g. which articles have cited this article).</p>



<p>Metrics can also be enhanced by other knowable signals that convey specific qualities about your article. Some of the most general of these are listed below:</p>



<ul><li>Peer-review status</li><li>Open availability of peer review report/decision letters</li><li>Availability of Open data/code/protocols/materials</li><li>Adherence to relevant ethical standards for research</li><li>Adherence to standards for rigorous research reporting (e.g. those of <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EQUATOR network</a>, <a href="https://arriveguidelines.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ARRIVE</a>, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">MDAR</a>)</li></ul>



<p>At PLOS, to showcase peer-review status, all articles show the Editor who handled the submission, the peer review timeline, and, if the authors chose the option, the published peer review report. </p>



<p>When publishing your research, you can make choices that help you demonstrate your commitment to rigor and credibility. When publishing with PLOS you <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">commit to share your underlying data</a>. You may also choose to <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">share your protocols, your code, to pre-register your study, and to publish the peer review history of your papers</a>. These are important choices that affirm your commitment to transparency and to your results being available to the scientific community to build upon. You can highlight these choices too, in addition to metrics!</p>



<p><strong>Which metrics and signals should I use to tell my Impact Narrative?</strong></p>



<p>To establish an effective Impact Narrative, showcase altmetrics that are the most <strong>relevant to the intentions of your research. </strong>Below are some ways this could be done. None of the examples below are mutually exclusive, researchers could be electing to promote all of these qualities:</p>



<h4><strong>Impact narratives: examples</strong></h4>



<ul><li>If citations are still the most useful measure of impact for your intentions, ensure you list your article with the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447#citedHeader" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">most up to date citation counts</a> (including the <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121478694" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">details</a>) rather than stating the Impact Factor of the journal you published in (especially if that score is calculated based on past articles that are not your own!) </li><li>If you intended your research to get the attention of the public in a geographic region, or of a particular community, showcase the <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">media mentions </a>and <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">social media coverage</a> you received in those target areas/communities. Each article has a great <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">summary page</a>, or you can highlight specific data points within that. Explore!</li><li>If having your article openly peer reviewed was of particular importance to you, ensure you link directly to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223994" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">published reviewer reports</a>.</li><li>If having your protocol readily available to be built upon is of particular importance, highlight <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bubqnsmw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this</a>.</li><li>If ensuring your data is open and reusable was an impact you were striving for, ensure you always highlight that your data is openly available (your PLOS article will always show this in the Data Availability Statement), and if your data is published on a data publication platform (example <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4685118#.YOiSGOhKiUk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">datasets </a>connected to a <em>PLOS Genetics</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009364" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">article</a>), highlight that unique usage too!  In general, always remember to demonstrate your impact in additional ways than always related to the article itself — by showcasing any reuse or extension of your data, code, protocols, etc.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>We encourage showcasing the signals of rigorous research practices. We encourage <em>engagement</em>, but not obsession, with metrics. Article-level metrics and altmetrics are intended to be useful, and metrics themselves are neutral, but any metric has the potential to be misused, over-interpreted, over-engineered, and gamed, by actors invested in a system. Therefore, here at PLOS, we believe the key is to always:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Be transparent</strong> (e.g. show the maximum or most accurate detail available, even if an average or total is displayed or used)</li><li><strong>Engage with metrics and signals</strong> to ensure <em>you </em>own the way they should relate to you (e.g. create own your impact narrative)</li></ul>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster access.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command line.</p>
<p>The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange questions.</p>
<p>* While MacOS has switched from <code>bash</code> to <code>zsh</code> as its default shell, <code>zsh</code><span class="quo">‘</span>s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all set.</p>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">enable <span class="caps">WSL2</span></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6">install Ubuntu</a> as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and patience)</li>
<li>The grammar of a shell command line</li>
<li>Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: <code>~</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pushd</code>/<code>popd</code>, <code>ssh</code></li>
<li>Seeing what’s there: <code>ls</code>, globbing, and strategies for naming your files</li>
<li>File system manipulations: <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>/<code>scp</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>ln -s</code>, <code>touch</code></li>
<li>Looking into files: <code>cat</code>, <code>head</code> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <code>tail</code>, <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>diff</code></li>
<li>Text manipulation: <code>sed</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>column</code></li>
<li>Putting things together: piping and redirection</li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software development.</p>
<p>This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code errors.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be required.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:<ul>
<li>Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install git</code></li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.</p>
<p>This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We’ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows users)</li>
<li>Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on installation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.</li>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-centaurus-a-galaxy-massive-jets-event-horizon">The latest picture of a black hole captures Centaurus A’s massive jets</a></h4>

<p>The Event Horizon Telescope is expanding its portfolio of black hole images.</p>



<p>In 2019, the telescope unveiled the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a>, revealing the supermassive beast 55 million light-years from Earth at the center of galaxy M87 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That lopsided orange ring showed the shadow of the black hole on its glowing accretion disk of infalling material. Since then, observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, have yielded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-eht-data-m87-black-hole-turbulence-wobble">more detailed views</a> of M87’s black hole (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). Now, EHT data have revealed new details of the supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy near our own, called Centaurus A.</p>



<p>Rather than zooming in close enough to see the black hole’s shadow, the new picture offers the clearest view yet of the powerful plasma jets erupting from the black hole. This perspective gives insight into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01417-w">how supermassive black holes blast such plasma jets into space</a>, researchers report online July 19 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a fairly impressive feat,” says radio astronomer Craig Walker of capturing the new high-resolution image. “These [jets] are some of the most powerful things in the universe,” says Walker, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., who was not involved in the work. Because such superfast plasma streams are thought to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-first-image-black-hole-questions">influence how galaxies grow and evolve</a>, astronomers are keen to understand how the jets form (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers pointed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">global network of radio dishes</a> that make up the EHT at Centaurus A for six hours in April 2017, during the same observing run that delivered the first picture of a black hole (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). About 12 million light-years from Earth, Centaurus A is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky and is known for the huge jets expelled by its central black hole.</p>



<p>“They extend to pretty much the entire scale of the galaxy,” says Michael Janssen, a radio astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. “If we were to see radio light [with our eyes], and we were to look at the night sky, then we would see these jets of Centaurus A as a structure that is 16 times bigger than the full moon.”</p>



<p>Using the EHT, Janssen and colleagues homed in on the base of those jets, which gush out from either side of the black hole’s accretion disk. The new image is 16 times as sharp as previous observations of the jets, probing details less than one light-day across — about four times the distance from the sun to Pluto. One of the most striking features that the image reveals is that only the outer edges of the jets seem to glow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="images of jets from the black hole in the galaxy Centaurus A" class="wp-image-3101599" height="339" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071621_mt_event-horizon_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101599">The supermassive black hole in the galaxy Centaurus A launches two jets of plasma in opposite directions (zoomed-out view of the jets at left).

The jet moving away from Earth, also bright only at the edges, points toward the bottom right.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101599">M. Janssen <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2021</span></figure>



<p>“That’s still a puzzle,” Janssen says. One possibility is that the jets are rotating, which might cause material in some regions of the jets to emit light toward Earth, while others don’t. Or the jets could be hollow, Janssen says.</p>



<p>Recent observations of a few other galaxies have hinted that the jets of supermassive black holes are brighter around the edges, says Denise Gabuzda, an astrophysicist at University College Cork in Ireland, who wasn’t involved in the work. “But it’s been hard to know whether it was a common feature, or whether it was something quirky about the few that had been observed.”</p>



<p>The new view of Centaurus A’s black hole provides evidence that this edge-brightening is common, Gabuzda says. “It’s fairly rare to be able to detect the jets coming out in both directions, but in the images of Centaurus A … you can clearly see that both of them are brighter at the edges.”</p>



<p>The next step will be to compare the EHT image of Centaurus A with computer simulations based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity, to test how well relativity holds up in this extreme environment, Janssen says. Examining the polarization, or orientation, of the light waves emanating from Centaurus A’s jets could also reveal the structure of their magnetic fields — just as polarization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">revealed the magnetism around M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-endangered-bonobos-nests">Climate change may be leading to overcounts of endangered bonobos</a></h4>

<p>Climate change is interfering with how researchers count bonobos, possibly leading to gross overestimates of the endangered apes, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Like other great apes, bonobos build elevated nests out of tree branches and foliage to sleep in. Counts of these nests can be used to estimate numbers of bonobos — as long as researchers have a good idea of how long a nest sticks around before it’s broken down by the environment, what’s known as the nest decay time.</p>



<p>New data on rainfall and bonobo nests show that the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252527">nests are persisting longer in the forests in Congo</a>, from roughly 87 days, on average, in 2003–2007 to about 107 days in 2016–2018, largely as a result of declining precipitation. This increase in nests’ decay time could be dramatically skewing population counts of the endangered apes and imperiling conservation efforts, researchers report June 30 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“Imagine going in that forest … you count nests, but each single nest is around longer than it used to be 15 years ago, which means that you think that there are more bonobos than there really are,” says Barbara Fruth, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.</p>





<p>Lowland tropical forests, south of the Congo River in Africa, are the only place in the world where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-first-great-apes-adopt-orphan-infant-outside-group">bonobos</a> (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) still live in the wild (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). Estimates suggest that there are at least 15,000 to 20,000 bonobos there. But there could be as many as 50,000 individuals. “The area of potential distribution is rather big, but there have been very few surveys,” Fruth says.</p>



<p>From 2003 to 2007, and then again from 2016 to 2018, Fruth and colleagues followed wild bonobos in Congo’s LuiKotale rain forest, monitoring 1,511 nests. “The idea is that you follow [the bonobos] always,” says Mattia Bessone, a wildlife researcher at the Liverpool John Moores University in England. “You need to be up early in the morning so that you can be at the spot where the bonobos have nested, in time for them to wake up, and then you follow them till they nest again.”</p>



<p>In doing so, day after day, Fruth, Bessone and colleagues were first able to understand how many nests a bonobo builds in a day, what’s known as the nest construction rate. “It’s not necessarily one because sometimes bonobos build day nests,” Bessone says. On average, each bonobo builds 1.3 nests per day, the team found.</p>



<p>Tracking how long these nests stuck around revealed that the structures were lasting an average of 19 days longer in 2016–2018 than in 2003–2007. The researchers also compiled fifteen years of climate data for LuiKotale, which showed a decrease in average rainfall from 2003 to 2018. That change in rain is linked to climate change, the researchers say, and helps explain why nests have become more resilient.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="four images of nests up in trees" class="wp-image-3101517" height="219" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_pp_bonobo_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101517">These images show bonobo nests at different stages of decay. Knowing the time it takes for a nest to decay is crucial for estimating accurate bonobo numbers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101517"><strong>© </strong>B. Fruth/MPI of Animal Behavior</span></figure>



<p>By counting the numbers of nests and then dividing that number by the product of the average nest decay time and nest construction rate, scientists can get an estimate of the number of bonobos in a region. But if researchers are using outdated, shorter nest decay times, those estimates could be severely off, overestimating bonobo counts by up to 50 percent, Bessone says.</p>



<p>“The results are not surprising but also highlight how indirect (and therefore prone to errors) our methods of density estimates of many species are,” Martin Surbeck, a behavioral ecologist at Harvard University, wrote in an e-mail.</p>



<p>Technologies such as camera traps can be used to directly count animals instead of using proxies like nests and are the way forward for animal population studies, researchers say.  But until those methods become more common, nest counts remain vital for scientists’ understanding of bonobo numbers.</p>



<p>This phenomenon is probably not limited to bonobos. All great apes build nests, and nest counts are used to estimate those animals’ numbers too. So, the researchers say, the new results could have implications for the conservation of primates far beyond bonobos.</p>

<p>The genetic tweaks that make humans uniquely human may come in small parcels interspersed with DNA inherited from extinct ancestors and cousins.</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc0776">1.5 percent to 7 percent</a> of the collective human genetic instruction book, or genome, contains uniquely human DNA, researchers report July 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That humans-only DNA, scattered throughout the genome, tends to contain genes involved in brain development and function, hinting that brain evolution was important in making humans human. But the researchers don’t yet know exactly what the genes do and how the exclusively human tweaks to DNA near those genes may have affected brain evolution.</p>



<p>“I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to say what makes us uniquely human,” says Emilia Huerta-Sanchez, a population geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. “We don’t know whether that makes us think in a specific way or have specific behaviors.” And Neandertals and Denisovans, both extinct human cousins, may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-art-suggests-neandertals-were-ancient-humans-mental-equals">thought much like humans</a> do (<em>SN: 2/22/18</em>).</p>





<p>The results don’t mean that individual people are mostly Neandertal or Denisovan, or some other mix of ancient hominid. On average, people in sub-Saharan Africa inherited 0.096 percent to 0.46 percent of their DNA from ancient <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">interbreeding between their human ancestors and Neandertals</a>, the researchers found (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>). Non-Africans inherited more DNA from Neandertals: about 0.73 percent to 1.3 percent. And some people inherited a fraction of their DNA from Denisovans as well.</p>



<p>Using a new computational method, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz examined every spot of DNA in the genomes of 279 people. The team compiled results from those individual genomes into a collective picture of the human genome. For each spot, the team determined whether the DNA came from Denisovans, Neandertals or was inherited from a common ancestor of humans and those long-lost relatives.</p>



<p>Although each person may carry about 1 percent Neandertal DNA, “if you look at a couple hundred people, they mostly won’t have their bit of Neandertal DNA in the same place,” says Kelley Harris, a population geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the work. “So if you add up all the regions where someone has a bit of Neandertal DNA, that pretty soon covers most of the genome.” </p>



<p>In this case, about 50 percent of the collective genome contains regions where one or more people inherited DNA from Neandertals or Denisovans, the researchers discovered. Most of the rest of the genome has been passed down from the most recent common ancestor of humans and their extinct cousins. After whittling away the ancient heirloom DNA, the team looked for regions where all people have human-specific tweaks to DNA that no other species have. That got the estimate of uniquely human DNA down to anywhere between 1.5 percent and 7 percent of the genome.</p>



<p>The finding underscores just how much interbreeding with other hominid species affected the human genome, says coauthor Nathan Schaefer, a computational biologist now at the University of California, San Francisco. The researchers confirmed previous findings from other groups that humans bred with Neandertals and Denisovans, but also with other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-west-africans-may-have-dna-genes-ancient-ghost-hominid">extinct, unknown hominids</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>). It’s not known whether those mysterious ancestors are the groups that included “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">Dragon Man”</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-fossil-new-hominid-nesher-ramla-homo-human-evolution">Nesher Ramla <em>Homo</em></a>, which may be closer relatives to humans than Neandertals (<em>SN: 6/25/21; SN: 6/24/21</em>). And the mixing and mingling probably happened multiple times between different groups of humans and hominids, Schaefer and colleagues found.</p>



<p>The tweaks that make the uniquely human DNA distinctive arose in a couple of evolutionary bursts, probably around 600,000 years ago and again about 200,000 years ago, the team found. Around 600,000 years ago is about the time that humans and Neandertals were forming their own branches of the hominid family tree.</p>



<p>The estimate of the amount of uniquely human DNA doesn’t take into account places where humans have gained DNA through duplication or other means, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancestral-humans-had-more-dna" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lost it</a>, says James Sikela, a genome scientist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora who wasn’t involved in the study (<em>SN: 8/6/15). </em>Such extra or missing DNA may have allowed humans to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/missing-bits-dna-may-define-humans" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">evolve new traits</a>, including some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-tweaks-built-humans-bigger-brains" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">involved in brain evolution</a> (<em>SN: 3/9/11; SN: 2/26/15</em>).</p>



<p>Ancient DNA usually has been degraded into tiny fragments and researchers have pieced together only portions the genomes from extinct hominids. The fragmented genomes make it difficult to tell where big chunks of DNA may have been lost or gained. For that reason, the researchers studied only small tweaks to DNA involving one or more DNA bases — the information-carrying parts of the molecule. Given that humans and Neandertals went their separate evolutionary ways relatively recently, it’s not surprising that only 7 percent or less of the genome has evolved the uniquely human tweaks, Sikela says. “I’m not shocked by that number.” Considering DNA that humans alone have added to their genomes might produce a higher estimate of exclusively human DNA, he says.</p>



<p>Or it could go the other way. As more genomes are deciphered from Neandertals, Denisovans and other extinct hominids, researchers may discover that some of what now seems like uniquely human DNA was also carried by those extinct relatives, Harris says. “This estimate of the amount of uniquely human regions is only going to go down.”</p>

In the US, there are 107,000 individuals on the wait list for kidney transplant with about 30,000 transplants performed annually in the US. Worldwide about 95,000 kidney transplants were performed with the majority occurring in North America and Europe. There has been a parallel initiative to promote the option of transplantation through education and awareness campaigns. These programs are needed to support the overall goal of availability of transplant for those that are medically eligible recipients. Since transplant is a such a limited resource, equally important to closing the gap of people wait-listed for transplant and availability of allografts should be work on preserving/prolonging allograft survival.</p>
<p>Polyoma virus BK Nephropathy (PVBKN) is a challenging issue in transplant.  While PVBKN has an incidence of less than 10% of transplant recipients, it can lead to significant graft loss through rejection episodes and difficulty in clearing the virus  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.14314">https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.14314</a>.   Early detection of the virus can provide a window for reduction of immunosuppression and possible use of antiviral agents to allow for allograft preservation.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02444-5">Nili et al</a>. in a recently published study looked at the use of immunohistochemistry studies of biopsies to enhance the diagnosis of PVBKN, Histopathologic evaluation, the gold standard, detects nuclear viral inclusion bodies. The addition of immunohistochemistry staining for SV40 picked up additional cases of PVBKN not noted to have the classic pathologic changes. These cases were hypothesized to be identified earlier in the evolution of the PVBKN.</p>
<p>Noninvasive testing has not provided a consistent reliable means for diagnosis as the degree of viremia and viruria may not correlate with disease. Given that most cases of allograft dysfunction will be evaluated by renal biopsy and the addition of the immunohistochemistry staining for SV40 is widely available and low cost, this seems an approach that should be adopted by transplant centers as routine. This may be more feasible than surveillance of screening for viruria or viremia for many years as there is the potential for PVBKN many years post transplantation. Another key factor to keep in mind is that many transplant recipients may not be followed by transplant nephrologists or transplant centers for routine care and may not be getting surveillance screening of blood and urine due to cost or availability of resources. The ability for early diagnosis and intervention to help preserve allograft function even for a few cases would be valuable for long term allograft preservation. This study highlights the need to continue efforts toward improving allograft survival and identify cost effective interventions that can readily be incorporated by many centers.  Ongoing dissemination of best practices is another key part of the improving care.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lakes-liquid-water-south-pole-ice-cap-mirages">Lakes of liquid water at Mars’ southern ice cap may just be mirages</a></h4>

<p>Maybe hold off on that Martian ice fishing trip. Two new studies splash cold water on the idea that potentially habitable lakes of liquid water exist deep under the Red Planet’s southern polar ice cap.</p>



<p>The possibility of a lake roughly 20 kilometers across was first raised in 2018, when the European Space Agency’s Mars Express spacecraft probed the planet’s southern polar cap with its Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, or MARSIS, instrument. The orbiter detected bright spots on radar measurements, hinting at a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid-water-search-life">large body of liquid water</a> beneath 1.5 kilometers of solid ice that could be an abode to living organisms (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/25/18</em>). Subsequent work found hints of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-south-pole-ice-surrounded-pools-water">additional pools surrounding the main lake basin</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the planetary science community has always held some skepticism over the lakes’ existence, which would require some kind of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lake-underground-volcano">continuous geothermal heating</a> to maintain subglacial conditions (<em>SN: 2/19/19</em>). Below the ice, temperatures average –68° Celsius, far past the freezing point of water, even if the lakes are a brine containing a healthy amount of salt, which lowers water’s freezing point. An underground magma pool would be needed to keep the area liquid — an unlikely scenario given Mars’ lack of present-day volcanism.</p>



<p>“If it’s not liquid water, is there something else that could explain the bright radar reflections we’re seeing?” asks planetary scientist Carver Bierson of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>





<p>In a study published in the July 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>, Bierson and colleagues describe a couple other substances that could explain the reflections. Radar’s reflectivity depends on the electrical conductivity of the material the radar signal moves through. Liquid water has a fairly distinctive radar signature, but examining the electrical properties of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL093880">both clay minerals and frozen brine revealed those materials could mimic this signal</a>.</p>



<p>Adding weight to the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL093631">non-lake explanation</a> is a study from an independent team, published in the same issue of <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. The initial 2018 watery findings were based on MARSIS data focused on a small section of the southern ice cap, but the instrument has now built up three-dimensional maps of the entire south pole, where hundreds to thousands of additional bright spots appear.</p>



<p>“We find them literally all over the region,” says planetary scientist Aditya Khuller, also of Arizona State University. “These signatures aren’t unique. We see them in places where we expect it to be really cold.”</p>



<p>Creating plausible scenarios to maintain liquid water in all of these locations would be a tough exercise. Both Khuller and Bierson think it is far more likely that MARSIS is pointing to some kind of widespread geophysical process that created minerals or frozen brines.</p>



<p>While previous work had already raised doubts about the lake interpretation, these additional data points might represent the pools’ death knell. “Putting these two papers together with the other existing literature, I would say this puts us at 85 percent confidence that this is not a lake,” says Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a planetary scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston who was not involved in either study.</p>



<p>The lakes, if they do exist, would likely be extremely cold and contain as much as 50 percent salt — conditions in which no known organisms on Earth can survive. Given that, the pools <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">wouldn’t make particularly strong astrobiological targets</a> anyway, Rivera-Valentín says. (<em>SN</em><em>: 5/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>Lab work exploring how substances react to conditions at Mars’ southern polar ice cap could help further constrain what generates the bright radar spots, Bierson says.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Khuller already has his eye on other areas of potential habitability on the Red Planet, such as warmer midlatitude regions where satellites have seen evidence of ice melting in the sun. “I think there are places where liquid water could be on Mars today,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s at the south pole.” </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-cells-soap-substance-bacteria-immunity">Human cells make a soaplike substance that busts up bacteria</a></h4>

<p>When faced with bacterial invaders, some human cells dispense a surprising substance: soap.</p>



<p>These cells, which aren’t part of the immune system, unleash a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8113">detergent-like protein that dissolves chunks of the inner membranes of bacteria</a>, killing the infiltrators, researchers report in the July 16 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The “professional” players of the immune system, like antibodies or white blood cells, get lots of attention, but “all cells are endowed with some ability to combat infection,” says immunologist John MacMicking, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Yale University.</p>



<p>In humans, these run-of-the-mill cellular defenses have often been overlooked, MacMicking says, even though they are part of “an ancient and primordial defense system” and could inform the development of new treatments for infections. </p>





<p>Often, nonimmune cells rely on a warning from their professional counterparts to combat infections. Upon detecting outsiders, specialized immune cells release an alarm signal called interferon gamma. That signal rouses other cells, including epithelial cells that line the throat and intestines and are often targeted by pathogens, to action.</p>



<p>MacMicking and colleagues looked for the molecular basis of that action by infecting laboratory versions of human epithelial cells with <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria, which can exploit cells’ nutrient-rich interior. Then, the team screened over 19,000 human genes, looking for those that conferred some protection from infection. </p>



<p>One gene, which contains instructions for a protein called APOL3, stood out. When this gene was disabled, the epithelial cells succumbed to a <em>Salmonella</em> infection, even when warned by interferon gamma. Zooming in on APOL3 molecules in action inside host cells with high-powered microscopy, the researchers found that the protein swarms invading bacteria and somehow kills them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="APOL3 protein dissolving Salmonella" class="wp-image-3101461" height="498" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071521_jl_bacteriabuster_inline1_rev.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3101461">Human epithelial cells can respond to a <em>Salmonella</em> infiltration by releasing a molecule called APOL3 (black dots in this microscope image), which acts like a detergent to dissolve parts of the bacteria’s internal membrane.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101461">R.G. Gaudet <em>et al</em>/<em>Science</em> 2021</span></figure>



<p><em>Salmonella </em>are hardy microbes, protected by an outer and inner membrane, a feature shared by many different forms of bacteria. This double layer renders these bacteria hard to kill, but further investigation revealed how APOL3 and another molecule, GBP1, work together to do it. GBP1 somehow loosens the bacteria’s outer membrane, opening doors for APOL3 to deliver its death-by-dissolution to the inner lipid membrane. APOL3 has both water-loving and lipid-loving parts, letting it bind to the inner membrane and dissolve it into the intracellular fluid, like soap washing away grease.</p>



<p>“We were a bit surprised to find detergent-like activity inside human cells,” MacMicking says, given such a molecule could dissolve host membranes too. But the researchers found that APOL3 specifically targets lipids found in bacteria, and its activity is blocked by cholesterol, a common component of mammalian cell membranes, leaving human tissues unaffected.</p>



<p>“Everything about these findings is supercool,” says Jessica Brinkworth, an evolutionary immunologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was not involved in the study. Many infections start in these epithelial cells, and understanding how they fight back is crucial to developing future treatments, she says.</p>



<p>“The really interesting finding is how the APOL3 is able to distinguish between bacterial membranes and host membranes,” she says. That evolution found such an elegant way to control this powerful tool “is a beautiful thing.”</p>

While the targeting of hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure levels are important as potential determinants of risk of morbidity and mortality, optimization of these parameters only addresses some of the factors relevant to different outcomes.</p>
<p>In a previous issue, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02277-2">Ozieh et al.</a> looked at the individual and cumulative impact of social determinants of health (depression, food insecurity, poverty level) on all cause mortality of 1376 individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Social determinants of health were significantly associated with mortality even with adjustments for demographics, lifestyle variables, glycemic control, and comorbidities. Depression was independently associated with mortality. Individuals with the presence of all 3 areas had a 41% higher risk of death. There has been recognition by health care providers that socioeconomic factors affect health in terms of access to care, health literacy, and adherence to treatment but the extent of the impact has been underestimated.</p>
<p>With the challenge of packed office/clinic schedules and numerous competing health conditions needing evaluation, the ability to spend time to understand the economic situations or characteristics of a patient’s life is not often available. Physicians may be limiting the ability to treat patients without that information. This understanding would serve to strengthen the provider-patient relationship. Perhaps the approach for the initial assessment for diabetes care, chronic kidney disease or hypertension care would include questions to gauge food insecurity, ability to follow specific diet, or ability to get to appointments.This information would allow creation of feasible plans of care and eliminate the usually inaccurate assumptions that an individual not following a prescribed treatment is a result of lack of care by the patient.</p>
<p>In the last few years, newer agents, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, have been introduced for management of diabetes with the promise of improved cardiac and renal outcomes. These agents are often expensive and often challenging to get insurance coverage. As research and pharmaceutical development brings us newer options for treatment, we need to remember that only addressing the biochemical parameters with therapeutics will not completely address the health impact of many of our chronic diseases. We need to advocate for investment in case management and social interventions at the same time.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about a paper "Clustering Functional Data into Groups by Using Projections".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We show that, in the functional data context, by appropriately exploiting the
functional nature of the data, it is possible to cluster the observations
asymptotically perfectly. We demonstrate that this level of performance can
sometimes be achieved by the k -means algorithm as long as the data are
projected on a carefully chosen finite dimensional space. In general, the
notion of an ideal cluster is not clearly defined. We derive our results in the
setting where the data come from two populations whose distributions differ at
least in terms of means, and where an ideal cluster corresponds to one of these
two populations. We propose an iterative algorithm to choose the projection
functions in a way that optimizes clustering performance, where, to avoid
peculiar solutions, we use a weighted least squares criterion. We apply our
iterative clustering procedure on simulated and real data, where we show that
it works well.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Hallucinations are a common symptom of schizophrenia and related disorders, but mentally well people experience them, too. In fact, work suggests that 6-7% of the general population <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_lnP3QL0c">hear voices that don’t exist</a>. However, exactly what predisposes well people to experience them has not been clear. Now a major new study of 1,394 people native to 46 different countries, led by Peter Moseley at Northumbria University, provides support for two hypotheses from earlier, smaller studies — namely, that a history of childhood trauma and a propensity to hear non-existent speech among background noise are both associated with experiencing hallucinations — but does not support three others.</p>



<p>“In terms of reproducibility, these results may be a cause for concern in hallucinations research (and cognitive and clinical psychology more broadly),” writes the team in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620985832">their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>. In firming up a few ideas, the work does, though, help to clarify what aspects of cognition as well as past experience are — and are not — linked to being more prone to hallucinations.</p>



<span id="more-42846"></span>



<p>The participants came into one of 11 data collection labs (in the UK, France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Canada, Norway and Australia) or participated online. They completed two scales that measured hallucinatory experiences, such as hearing, seeing or smelling something when there was nothing to explain those perceptions. They also reported on incidences of childhood trauma (being regularly criticised by a parent, for example). And they completed a series of tasks that tapped into cognitive processes identified in earlier work as being linked to hallucinations in the general population, as well as in patient groups.</p>



<p>The team found that experience of childhood trauma and performance on just the “auditory signal detection task” was linked to hallucinations. That task (which was completed by only the 594 participants who visited the labs) measured the participants’ ability to tell whether or not brief clips of speech had been played during longer bursts of noise. Those who scored higher on the hallucinatory scales had a higher false alarm rate — they were more likely to report hearing a voice when none was present. This data supports the previously proposed idea that hallucinations are linked to the brain over-relying on <em>expectations</em> of what will be perceived, vs actual sensory input. A higher false alarm rate on this kind of task is also seen in patients with schizophrenia, as is a history of adverse experiences in childhood.</p>



<p>However, in contrast to what has been found for patient groups and smaller, earlier studies of the general population, there was no association between hallucinatory experiences and results on tests of “dichotic listening” (which assessed the degree to which language processing was lateralised), “source memory” (remembering whether they’d actually heard or only imagined hearing various words) or verbal working memory. So, it seems that for well people who hallucinate, a failure to distinguish between what they have imagined vs what they have actually sensed, for example, doesn’t seem to be a cause. This adds to recent <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/24/a-key-brain-difference-between-voice-hearing-patients-and-voice-hearing-healthy-controls-challenges-the-continuum-model/">doubts about the idea of a “continuum model”</a> for voice-hearing, which theorises that patients are simply further along the same voice-hearing spectrum as people in the general population who hear voices.</p>



<p>However, given the previously small sample sizes, lack of standardisation of studies on patients, and sparsity of direct replications, it’s hard to be sure whether hallucinations in well vs mentally unwell people have fundamentally different causes. “Further preregistered studies with large samples in these groups are needed,” the team writes. That work would not only help to further address the reproducibility issues in this field of research, but hopefully also clarify the mechanisms underlying hallucinations in general.</p>

Teledentistry supports the delivery of oral health services through electronic communication means, connecting providers and patients without the usual time and space constraints. Teledentistry’s unique ability to connect disadvantaged, rural communities and the home-bound with dental providers makes this method particularly well-suited to address the lack of access during and after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Teledentistry can be used for consultation and triage, allowing providers to advise patients whether their dental concerns constitute a need for urgent or emergency care, whether a condition could be temporarily alleviated at home, or whether treatment could be postponed. Teledentistry and distance learning can also be used to facilitate access to preventive services and oral health education.</p>

As temperatures rise and weather patterns shift, one can only imagine the number of people and financial resources needed to provide services if we continue unabated on this current dangerous path. We lack accurate figures but hypothesize that the destruction of formal structures and social safety nets during natural disasters will likely lead to increases in violence against children.</p>
<p>When disaster strikes, we often do not have time to ask questions of how and why violence occurs. We create research that is responsive and immediate, focusing on enumeration of children at highest risk of violence or top concerns of affected communities. However, if we do not understand fully which aspects of the disaster leads to violence, how can we prevent it?</p>
<p>This question has echoed in my head many times over the years, as I spent the better part of a decade conducting research on child protection violations in humanitarian emergencies. Those who work in disaster response and humanitarian emergencies are guided by the premise that we do not cause harm, and therefore, our interventions are needed and justified. Corresponding research is process driven to improve upon existing service delivery. I often wondered if we could create a more public health approach that targets the upstream drivers of violence.</p>
<p>Our systematic review published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> collates information on the potential pathways between natural disasters and violence against children to suggest points of intervention. We identified five pathways to violence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environmentally induced changes in supervision, accompaniment, and child separation</li>
<li>Transgression of social norms in post-disaster behavior</li>
<li>Economic stress</li>
<li>Negative coping with stress</li>
<li>Insecure shelter and living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The findings have three major implications for action. First, while it is likely that a greater number of pathways exists, given the scarcity of the evidence, we can say with assurance that intervening on each of these aspects of the post-disaster environment would help to prevent violence. Violence prevention programming should structure interventions that target these five pathways after natural disasters.</p>
<p>We have a wealth of evidence-based interventions that can be utilized; for instance, <em>SASA!</em> (meaning “now” in Kiswahili) for social norms change, <em>Parents Make the Difference</em> for positive parenting, and <em>Cure Violence</em> for creating safe environments. Global standards in the <em>Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPMS)</em> and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) <em>INSPIRE: Seven Strategies for Ending Violence against Children</em> should be met in building interventions.</p>
<p>Second, we should leverage the already existing knowledge and resilience of communities whom often experience natural disasters cyclically. We found that some families and communities were able to protect children from violence after natural disasters, particularly in terms of creating new accompaniment and supervision structures. Natural disasters may be unique from armed conflict in that community trust is greater intact.</p>
<p>We should look to indigenous knowledge that bolsters local response. These strategies are likely to be effective, more easily promoted than external interventions, and supportive of efforts to localize response. We highly encourage greater documentation and evaluation of positive behaviors after natural disasters that work to prevent violence.</p>
<p>Third, multi-pronged approaches are essential in preventing violence. The five outlined pathways individually lead to violence but do not act in isolation. Programming must be created to combat multiple pathways.</p>
<p>Suppose a service provider creates a livelihoods program to address the economic stress pathway to violence. Unconditional cash transfers are provided to women heads of household in an effort to ensure that money is used for family needs. Violence against women and children may still occur in societies where it transgresses gender norms for women to be breadwinners of households. Humanitarians may cause more harm than good if they do not bundle livelihoods interventions with social norms change.</p>
<p>The livelihoods intervention further does not alleviate other negative coping behaviors. Violence against children may still occur if women caregivers are not provided with parenting programs and mental health support to cope with acute and ongoing stress from the natural disaster.</p>

<p>Without addressing all pathways, violence against children will likely continue to occur. Individual agencies should design comprehensive interventions that address multiple pathways to violence, and humanitarian coordination mechanisms can ensure that no gaps exist in government and agency services.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Multiple factors influence how we perform educationally: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/22/school-kids-memory-is-better-for-material-delivered-with-enthusiasm-because-it-grabs-their-attention/">the way</a> we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/18/teachers-show-biases-against-overweight-kids-including-giving-them-lower-grades/">taught</a>, our particular <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/27/students-with-adhd-arent-always-given-the-support-they-need-to-thrive-at-university/">needs</a> and how they’re met, our parents, and our <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439867/RR439B-Ethnic_minorities_and_attainment_the_effects_of_poverty_annex.pdf.pdf">socio-economic background</a> to name a few. Gaps in attainment can start from very early on: some children have already <a href="https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/too_young_to_fail/too_young_to_fail_-_oct_2013.pdf">fallen behind</a> before the age of seven.</p>



<p>But what about how much we <em>enjoy</em> school? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-021-00092-w">new study</a> in <em>npj Science of Learning</em>, led by the University of Bristol’s Tim Morris, looks at this relatively under-explored factor. And the team finds that enjoyment at the age of six has a significant impact on achievement, which was visible even years later when participants took their GCSEs.</p>



<span id="more-42841"></span>



<p>Data was gathered from participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which has been tracking parents and their children from 1991 onwards. At the age of six, participants were asked if they liked school, before answering further questions on their enjoyment six months later.</p>



<p>Educational attainment was measured through exam results aged 16, and the team also looked at sex, month of birth and school year, ethnicity, cognitive ability aged eight, maternal education and the socioeconomic position of parents. Mothers who took part in the study also reported how much their children liked their teachers aged six, and children themselves self-reported their temperament by answering questions on how happy or angry they were.</p>



<p>From the age of eight, children answered questions on their confidence in their work and intelligence, as well as how happy they were with their number of friends and the quality of their friendships. Finally, the team looked at the home learning environment through questions on how families taught their children colours, language, numbers, songs and shapes and sizes.</p>



<p>There was no relationship between school enjoyment and parental socioeconomic status: those who had parents in so-called “skilled” occupations were just as likely to enjoy school as those in “unskilled” occupations. Children with higher cognitive ability were more likely to enjoy school than not, girls were twice as likely to say they enjoyed school than boys, and non-white children were almost twice as likely to report enjoying school than their white counterparts.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a strong relationship between children’s opinion of their teacher and how much they enjoyed school: those whose parents reported that they liked their teachers were more than nine times more likely to enjoy school than those who did not. Similarly, those who had confidence in their work also enjoyed school more.</p>



<p>Enjoyment of school didn’t just have a short-term impact, however. Those who enjoyed school at age six scored on average 14.4 more points at GCSE — a difference of two grades — even when the researchers had controlled for other factors related to educational achievement like cognitive ability and family socioeconomic status. They were also 29% more likely to obtain five or more A*-C grades, including those Maths and English qualifications so crucial for employment. In fact, enjoyment of school aged six was almost as strong a predictor of educational achievement aged 16 as other factors such as sex and socioeconomic status.</p>



<p>It may seem obvious that enjoyment of school has an impact on grades. But it’s striking that enjoyment at age six may impact grades aged 16, particularly when you consider its relative importance alongside factors like gender and cognitive ability.</p>



<p>The results also appear promising for potential interventions. Enjoyment is potentially more modifiable than socioeconomic factors; designing interventions that target school enjoyment and promote positive feelings about school could therefore have a significant impact on attainment many years down the line.</p>



<p>The team notes that the results should not be taken as a definitive way to address inequality in education, an issue which is clearly complex and multi-layered; future research could also explore <em>why</em> children do or do not enjoy school and how this interacts with external, social factors. However, thinking carefully about enjoyment could be one piece in the jigsaw of academic attainment.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.036">Food insecurity</a> can be defined as “the inability to consume an adequate quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so”. As well as hunger, this definition captures the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf">dimensions</a> of food insecurity (or food poverty) that are sometimes overlooked: stability, agency and sustainability. Can people <em>always</em> access food? Can they do so in a way that’s free of shame and stigma? Will the current food system work for us all in the long-term?</p>
<p><strong>Portrayal of food insecurity in UK newspapers</strong></p>
<p>Food insecurity presents a large and growing problem in the UK. We estimated that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020000087">24% of UK adults</a> were experiencing food insecurity in 2017 – resorting to <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/end-year-stats/">food banks</a> among other coping mechanisms to feed their families. Our study aimed to understand the ways in which newspapers covered the topic of food insecurity – how the problem and drivers were framed. This provides insight on the attitudes towards the problem, the potential solutions and their acceptability among different stakeholders.</p>
<p>The picture our work painted was a nuanced one, where many societal, political and economic factors were portrayed as contributing to the growing problem of food insecurity. At the heart of it, people did not have enough money to meet their needs. The reasons often cited for this were: low wages, insecure jobs, unemployment and high cost of living.</p>
<p>But further upstream, we saw more contention. Charities and advocacy groups highlighted the structural barriers to people meeting their living costs – austerity, funding cuts, policies that exacerbate social inequalities. The roll-out of the Universal Credit social security system (introduced to replace several means-tested benefits) was also considered a major contributor to the problem, especially the long <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/five-weeks-too-long/">wait</a> (of at least 5 weeks) when switching from the old system to Universal Credit.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-12457 size-large" height="367" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/blog-1024x587.png" width="640" />
<p>The voices of charities, advocacy groups and the general public appeared united within the news articles – people were urging the government to take action. The government, however, was portrayed as reluctant to admit links between welfare policies and increasing food insecurity, with government representatives calling food insecurity a ‘cash flow’ issue and promoting charity to help those experiencing food insecurity.</p>
<p>Our work highlights a disconnect between the problem and the solutions. The problem was presented as systemic, whilst the solutions were heavily reliant on charity – solutions that, at best, provide short-term relief for families experiencing hunger, unhealthy diets and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1332/175982716X14721954314922">social consequences</a> of food insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Holiday hunger </strong></p>
<p>The issue of ‘holiday hunger’ (hunger experienced by children during the school holidays, often because they are no longer receiving free school meals) has brought more attention onto the problem. This has resulted in some political action, e.g. the <a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Childrens-Future-Food-Inquiry-report.pdf">Children’s Future Food Inquiry</a> and the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/408/food-poverty-health-and-environment-committee/">House of Lord’s Select Committee Inquiry on Food, Poverty, Health, and Environment</a>.</p>
<p>A debate surrounding food vouchers for children who usually receive free school meals at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was played out in the media. <a href="https://endchildfoodpoverty.org/">Campaigners</a> pressured the government to provide food vouchers to low-income families throughout the summer. Their success in reversing the government’s decision to not provide support during the summer holidays shows news media to be a powerful tool for advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity in post-pandemic UK </strong></p>
<p>As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the economic factors contributing to food insecurity will have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/03/the-uks-covid-19-unemployment-crisis-in-six-charts">worsened</a>. Urgent action must be taken to protect families from food insecurity, with a focus on solutions that address the upstream drivers rather than relying on food banks and other forms of charitable food aid.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>A striking paper in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2018 <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/24/the-liking-gap-we-tend-to-underestimate-the-positive-first-impression-we-make-on-strangers/">revealed consistent evidence for the “liking gap” — that other people like us more than we think</a>. Now, for the first time, researchers have looked at how this phenomenon arises during childhood. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980754">The study</a>, led by Wouter Wolf at Duke University, US, on children aged 4 to 11, found that the liking gap emerged by around 5, and then grew wider with age. The findings have theoretical but also practical implications: parents and teachers can reassure kids that their judgements about what their peers think of them are likely to be overly negative, which could be of particular help to those who are worried about their relationships with classmates.</p>



<span id="more-42829"></span>



<p>Wolf and his colleagues recruited pairs of children who didn’t know each other from a local museum and other events. They first spent five minutes building a tower together. Then each child used a seven-item emoticon scale, which ranged from a crying face to a beaming face, to rate their feelings about the other child (how much they liked the other boy or girl, wanted to play with them again, and wanted them to be their friend) and to indicate what ratings they thought their partner would give them. The difference between a child’s perceptions of their partner’s ratings of them and their partner’s actual ratings gave a “liking gap” score for each participant. </p>



<p>Data on a total of 261 children were included in the analysis. The gender make-up of the pairs made no difference to the results. However, age did: a liking gap appeared by around the age of five, and was more extreme as age increased.</p>



<p>The causes for the gap among the youngest and older children were different, though. When the gap first emerged, it was driven by more positive partner evaluations — five-year-olds liked other kids more than four-year-olds did. The team thinks this reflects greater exposure to children (kindergarten enrolment is mandatory at five in the area of the US where the study was conducted), which could reduce anxiety about strangers and make social interactions more enjoyable.</p>



<p>The expansion of the liking gap after age five was driven by something different, however: as they grew older, the kids had increasingly <em>less</em> positive perceptions of their partner’s feelings about them. “This suggests that after the emergence of the liking gap between ages four and five, its subsequent development is primarily driven by increased social concern with other people’s evaluations of the self,” the team writes.</p>



<p>This would fit with other work finding that children develop a more complex theory of mind around age six, when they also start to become more concerned about the impression they are making on others. They may start to realise, for example, that another child might be being friendly because they want to come across as friendly and likeable, rather than because that other child is genuinely enjoying their company. As the gap widened with age, this suggests that, up to 11, at least, children become less certain about what another child’s behaviour really signals.</p>



<p>Individual differences might influence the scale of an individual’s liking gap. “It is not implausible that, in some cases, shyness, social anxiety or insecure attachment could be a manifestation or a consequence of a relatively high discrepancy between how much children like other people and how much they think other people generally like them back,” the team notes.</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed to explore this. But perhaps simply explaining the existence of the liking gap to kids might be one way to improve how children feel about their interactions with their peers, especially with strangers — when joining a new school, say. That’s a study I’d really like to see.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Na Helian will talk about her work done together with her PhD student Stiphen Chowdhury about "Feature Weighted Density-based Clustering".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>DBSCAN is arguably the most popular density-based clustering algorithm, and it
is capable of recovering non-spherical clusters. One of its main weaknesses is
that it treats all features equally. In this paper, we propose a density-based
clustering algorithm capable of calculating feature weights representing the
degree of relevance of each feature, which takes the density structure of the
data into account. First, we improve DBSCAN and introduce a new algorithm
called DBSCANR. DBSCANR reduces the number of parameters of DBSCAN to one. Then,
a new step is introduced to the clustering process of DBSCANR to iteratively
update feature weights based on the current partition of data. The feature
weights produced by the weighted version of the new clustering algorithm,
W-DBSCANR, measure the relevance of variables in a clustering and can be used
in feature selection in data mining applications where large and complex
real-world data are often involved. Experimental results on both artificial and
real-world data have shown that the new algorithms outperformed the DBSCAN type
algorithms in recovering clusters in data.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/o2MPJ3WWCYo/">Methods as a scientific asset</a></h4>

<p>A research article is an orderly summation of a complex and circuitous process. It is characterized by detailed planning, iterative trial and error, meticulous execution and thoughtful analysis. As a summary, articles are invaluable, but detailed insight into processes and procedures is required to truly understand and reproduce research. Detailed public methodological documentation can contextualize results, subvert bias, enhance reproducibility, and increase efficiency across the entire scientific ecosystem. In recent years, the research community has gained a deeper appreciation for the value of detailed methodological documentation. Here’s why:</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-research">Methods <em>are </em>research</h2>



<p>Developing a methodology and then executing it is arguably the largest component of research. It’s the day-to-day business of science, the mechanism for capturing data that can later be used to investigate a research question. Depending on the field and approach, methods can take many forms, from a recipe-like protocol, to a script, to a database of behavioral stimuli. But whatever the specifics, a clear and complete method is key to running a consistent and reliable study, reproducing the work in future, and understanding the results as a reader.</p>



<p>Just as with research articles, restricted access to methods creates inefficiencies and slows progress. Researchers expend time (and funding) developing similar approaches, repeating experiments and pursuing dead ends, unaware of related work. Out-dated procedures remain in use long after they’ve been superseded because practitioners cannot access the latest advances. And there is an opportunity cost. Researchers rely on other research for inspiration, direction and advancement. When the products of research remain hidden, promising new leads may be left unexplored.</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-lasting">Methods are lasting</h2>



<p>Methods are highly transferable. More than any other research artifact, methods have the potential for adaptation or reuse in different contexts and across a broad range of research questions and disciplines. For evidence, look no further than researchers’ frequently expressed frustration with “citation trails” in which an article methods section cites the methods section of an earlier work, and that work cites another work, and so on, often going back years, or even decades. Similarly, stand-alone methods articles are often <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157718300440?via%3Dihub">among the most highly-cited</a> publications, and they continue to receive citations over a longer period of time than standard research articles.</p>



<h2 id="results-are-subjective">Results are subjective—methods less so</h2>



<p>In order to generate conclusions, researchers make choices about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0462-9">how to analyze data</a> and interpret the patterns they observe. These analytical and interpretive choices are valuable, but subjective. They benefit from the researchers’ intuition, inspiration and expertise—but those same factors can also introduce bias and lead to misinterpretation. The unencumbered, unprocessed artifacts of research—such as methods and raw data—are much less likely to be influenced either positively or negatively by personal interests, insights or opinions. They are closer to neutral—a clear accounting, rather than an argument with a personal perspective.</p>



<h2 id="methods-are-insufficiently-described">Methods are insufficiently described</h2>



<p>A research article is not an instruction manual. Often, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/plan-replicate-50-high-impact-cancer-papers-shrinks-just-18">published research cannot be reproduced</a>, not because the original work was flawed, but simply because the article format is not conducive to a really in-depth description of the process.</p>

<h2 id="methods-serve-authors">Methods serve authors, readers and the research community</h2>



<p>Clear, complete, and open methods increase credibility and support lasting impact. Documenting and sharing methodologies has interrelated scientific and reputational benefits for individuals and the community. </p>



<ul><li>Making methods public creates a positive impression. Having the option to review detailed methods increases readers’ trust, whether or not they consult the documentation. </li><li>Researchers can more easily reproduce results with detailed open methods. Authors who want to apply the method in their own research can do so more efficiently if the approach is described in detail and easy to find online.</li><li>Strong, easy-to-follow methods are more likely to be used in future research, and by extension more likely to be cited, bringing fresh eyes to the original and helping it to remain relevant over time.</li></ul>



<p>Under the best circumstances, these three factors can feed off one another in an expanding cycle of trust, reuse, and readership.</p>



<h2 id="future-of-methods">The future of methods as permanent assets</h2>



<p>This combination of relevance, usefulness, potential for reuse, and demand suggests that methods deserve a more formalized, permanent place in the scientific record. Methods should be reviewed and validated, indexed and archived, searched for and cited. They should be treated as stand-alone research artifacts, rather than supplementary material of interest only within the context of a research article. </p>



<p>Alongside their enormous potential to positively impact the research community, sharing methods has a comparatively low barrier to entry for authors. From a practical perspective, process documentation often already exists in some form (for example, in instructions for internal use, or as part of a funding application), providing a convenient basis for a publication. More importantly, detailed, published methods are a natural extension of existing practice. Some discussion of methods has always been standard in the sciences. Increasing depth and detail, establishing norms, implementing peer review, and formalizing publication are all important and logically consistent extensions, analogous to the evolution of scientific discourse from published correspondence in the 18th century into the modern peer-reviewed research article. It will take time, community discussion and experimentation to refine and establish new norms for communicating methods—but the notion of communicating methods at all does not inspire the same heated debate as other aspects of Open Science practice. </p>



<h2>How can we communicate methods more effectively?</h2>



<p>The scholarly community is developing new ways to document, preserve and communicate methods for future use. In a future post, we’ll explore some of them.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conspiracy theories have surged over the last few years, as we’ve <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=conspiracy+theories">frequently reported</a>. One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/23/study-shows-60-of-britons-believe-in-conspiracy-theories">2018 study</a>, for example, found that 60% of British people believed in a conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the rise of QAnon in America has been particularly alarming.</p>



<p>It’s easy to dismiss conspiracy theorists — but this is not a productive way to tackle the issue. Instead, researchers are exploring <em>why</em> people get sucked into such belief systems, even at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/">expense of personal relationships</a>. This work can help us understand why conspiracies spread, and provide some useful guidance for talking to loved ones who may have fallen for a conspiracy theory.</p>



<span id="more-42812"></span>



<p><strong>Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?</strong></p>



<p>There are a number of reasons someone may be attracted to a conspiracy theory, often related to frustrated psychological needs. </p>



<p>“The first of these needs are <em>epistemic</em>, related to the need to know the truth and have clarity and certainty” explains Karen M. Douglas, Professor of Social Psychology at the University of Kent. “The other needs are <em>existential</em>, which are related to the need to feel safe and to have some control over things that are happening around us, and <em>social</em>, which are related to the need to maintain our self-esteem and feel positive about the groups that we belong to.”</p>



<p>So, for instance, if someone is anxious about the pandemic and feels out of control, they may be drawn to theories that suggest it is false, satisfying their existential needs. If they are frustrated about a particularly political situation, they may start exploring apparently clear-cut solutions to unanswerable questions, satisfying their epistemic needs.</p>



<p>There are also numerous risk factors related to conspiratorial thinking: conspiracy theories can be fuelled by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">a desire to feel special</a> or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/abs/are-conspiracy-theories-harmless/FA0A9D612CC82B02F91AAC2439B4A2FB">political apathy</a>, for example. People with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">lower levels of critical thinking</a> are also more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, as Stephan Lewandowsky, co-author of a recent <a href="https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ConspiracyTheoryHandbook.pdf">Conspiracy Theory Handbook</a> and Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol, explains.</p>



<p>Those who endorse conspiracy theories are “usually people who believe that intuition is a better way to know the truth than data — people who think their gut feeling is telling them what to believe and who don’t need or want evidence to make a decision,” he says. “They don’t have a healthy level of scepticism.”</p>



<p>Conspiracy theories, by their nature, are also “self-sealing”, meaning that evidence can’t be used to refute them — one of the reasons they are so hard to counter. “The absence of any evidence is taken to be evidence <em>for </em>the theory”,  Lewandowsky explains. “To give you one example, there was someone claiming on YouTube last year that Anthony Fauci was personally directing money into a lab in Wuhan. When the interviewer said there was no evidence, her reply was ‘see, that’s how good the cover-up is. There’s no evidence because they cover it up so well’.”</p>



<p><strong>How to talk to somebody who believes in conspiracy theories</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would prevent conspiracy theories from taking root in the first place. As Douglas and her colleague Daniel Jolley note in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12453">study</a> on the anti-vaccination movement, “inoculation” can prevent the influence of conspiracy theories to begin with.</p>



<p>They found that anti-conspiracy arguments increased intention to vaccinate a child when presented <em>before</em> conspiracy theories. But once these conspiracies were established, they were much more difficult to correct, even with arguments that were factual and seemed logical.</p>



<p>So talking to somebody before they become immersed in the world of conspiracy theories could be a way of preventing it altogether — something Lewandowsky and other authors <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799">refer to as “prebunking”</a>. As <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/summer-2020/vaccinating-against-viruses-mind">David Robson wrote</a> for <em>The Psychologist</em> last year, this isn’t just a case of presenting new information — rather, it’s about encouraging people to think critically, arming them with techniques to protect against misinformation. (The <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/december-2020/game-vs-fake-news">“Bad News” game</a>, developed by University of Cambridge researchers, is one example of an intervention oriented around critical thinking.)</p>



<p>Dispelling a conspiracy theory once it’s entrenched, however, is not an easy task. “When people believe something so strongly, it’s difficult to change their minds,” Douglas says. “People are very good at selecting and interpreting information that seems to confirm what they already believe, and to reject or misinterpret information that goes against those beliefs.”</p>



<p>But <a href="https://theconversation.com/ive-been-talking-to-conspiracy-theorists-for-20-years-here-are-my-six-rules-of-engagement-143132">as academic Jovan Byford writes in <em>The Conversation</em></a>, “underpinning conspiracy theories are feelings of resentment, indignation and disenchantment about the world”. So it’s important to understand the emotions that might be behind someone’s false beliefs, and to try and empathise with them.</p>



<p>One study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886921000799">published in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em></a> earlier this year found that those espousing COVID-19 conspiracy theories were more likely to experience anxiety, while <a href="https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/10151">another</a> found that many conspiracy theorists also felt that they had little control over their lives or the political situations they found themselves in.</p>



<p>Douglas points out that people believing in conspiracies may feel “confused, worried and alienated”. It would be counterproductive, therefore, to behave in a hostile or ridiculing way towards them. “This just dismisses their views and might alienate them even further and push them further towards conspiracy theories,” she says. “It’s important to keep calm and listen.” “The whole thing is about empathy,” agrees Lewandowsky. “Ridiculing people doesn’t help — and there is evidence to suggest that you shouldn’t do that.”</p>



<p>As anyone who has had a strained family conversation about politics will attest, it can be hard not to respond in a combative manner if you fundamentally disagree with the way somebody sees the world. But <a href="https://www.mikeyeomans.info/papers/receptiveness.pdf">research from Harvard Business School</a>, published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, suggests that being receptive might be the way forward instead.</p>



<p>The team, led by Mike Yeomans, argues that “conversational receptiveness” is key to de-escalating conflict: if you talk to someone in a way that indicates you’re receptive to <em>their </em>views and beliefs, they’re more likely to be persuaded by yours.</p>



<p>Simple phrases like “I understand that…” or “What you’re saying is…” could therefore bridge the gap between you and somebody with entirely different views — and even if this doesn’t mean they disavow a conspiracist belief, it could help a relationship remain friendly and non-antagonistic.</p>



<p><strong>Power and purpose</strong></p>



<p>As Lewandowsky points out, empowering people may also help to combat conspiratorial thinking. As we’ve seen, belief in conspiracy theories is closely linked to feelings of powerlessness — so it follows that instilling a sense of control could help ward off conspiracism.</p>



<p>On a personal level, people can be empowered through interventions that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25217762/">encourage analytic thinking</a> and that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3161">remind them of times they were in control.</a> In one study, for example, participants who were asked to recall a situation in which they were in control were less likely to believe in a conspiracy theory than those asked to recall a situation in which they were out of control. Such approaches may help you get through to someone you care about.</p>



<p>“One thing that can be done is to restore people’s sense of control,” Lewandowsky says. “One of the reasons people become conspiracy theorists is because they feel they’ve lost control of their lives and they’re afraid — that’s one of the reasons why a pandemic will trigger more of this thinking, because people have lost control of their lives.”</p>



<p>“So that’s one indirect way of getting at it — don’t try to talk someone out of it, but make them feel good about being in charge of their lives. Then they may gradually give up, because they don’t need it anymore.”</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that it will always be possible to disabuse someone of their beliefs. “The hardcore believers who are really down the rabbit hole… they are extremely difficult to reach,” Lewandowsky says. It’s also important to protect your own wellbeing when having conversations that may be frustrating or upsetting. But treating people who believe in conspiracy theories with empathy and calmness may be the first step towards a productive conversation.</p>

Alex Cayco-Gajic, Harsha Gurnani, Diccon Coyle &amp; R. Angus Silver)</a></h4>

<p>New paper in Nature Neuroscience: Cerebellar granule cell axons support high-dimensional representations (Frederic Lanore, N. Alex Cayco-Gajic, Harsha Gurnani, Diccon Coyle &amp; R. Angus Silver)</p>
<blockquote><p>In classical theories of cerebellar cortex, high-dimensional sensorimotor representations are used to separate neuronal activity patterns, improving associative learning and motor performance. Recent experimental studies suggest that cerebellar granule cell (GrC) population activity is low-dimensional. To examine sensorimotor representations from the point of view of downstream Purkinje cell ‘decoders’, we used three-dimensional acousto-optic lens two-photon microscopy to record from hundreds of GrC axons. Here we show that GrC axon population activity is high dimensional and distributed with little fine-scale spatial structure during spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, distinct behavioral states are represented along orthogonal dimensions in neuronal activity space. These results suggest that the cerebellar cortex supports high-dimensional representations and segregates behavioral state-dependent computations into orthogonal subspaces, as reported in the neocortex. Our findings match the predictions of cerebellar pattern separation theories and suggest that the cerebellum and neocortex use population codes with common features, despite their vastly different circuit structures.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Imagine that you’re with your partner at a party and you both get chatting to a stranger. Your partner and the stranger get on really well. Before long, they’re laughing away and ignoring you. Which would hurt most: rejection by the stranger, or by your partner?</p>



<p>The answer, according to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-53161-002.html">new research</a> in <em>Social Psychology</em> is that — in the moment, at least — they would hurt the same. It seems that we have such a deep need for affiliation that any form of ostracism triggers similar levels of immediate pain.</p>



<span id="more-42799"></span>



<p>Anne Böckler at Leibniz University in Germany and colleagues asked participants to come to the lab with either a friend of the same sex or a romantic partner (of the opposite sex, in this case). While in a separate room from their friend/partner, they played a screen-based ball-tossing game with what they thought was their friend/partner and a third online player. In fact, the passes from this other “player” as well as the passes that the participant believed their friend/partner to be making were controlled by the researchers.</p>



<p>Photographs of the participant, their friend/partner and the third player (who was of the same gender as the friend/partner) were displayed on the screen next to individual icons. By clicking different buttons on the keyboard, the participant could choose who to pass the ball to. But how many times they were themselves passed the ball depended on their experimental condition. “Included” participants received 20 of the overall 60 passes (as would happen if the ball tosses were equally shared). Those who were “excluded by their friend/partner” received 10 passes overall, all from the stranger. Those who were “excluded by the stranger” also received a total of 10 passes, but all from their friend/partner. People in the fourth group were more completely excluded: after receiving two passes at the beginning of the game, they were then ignored.</p>



<p>Immediately after the game, participants completed questionnaires about their mood during and after playing. These revealed that exclusion dampened people’s mood during (though not after) the game, whether they had been excluded by a partner, friend or stranger. Total exclusion had a bigger effect on mood.</p>



<p>Fully-included participants also scored higher than all the others on measures of “belongingness”, self-esteem, meaningful existence (having a central reason for being), and overall basic need satisfaction. Those who had been fully excluded showed even lower basic need satisfaction than the other groups, though full exclusion did not worsen effects on self-esteem. “Crucially, when comparing exclusions by close other with exclusion by a stranger we found no significant differences for any individual or overall basic needs,” the researchers note. Scores for relationship satisfaction were also lower when the participants were excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner, and lowest among those who were totally excluded. So, while the degree of ostracism clearly mattered, being excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner had the same impacts.</p>



<p>This is a small study, however. And it focused on impacts during and immediately after the game. Rejection by a romantic partner or close friend would surely have longer-lasting effects — even if indirectly, by altering perceptions of the quality of the relationship itself. (I should note that the participants were all debriefed afterwards.) A bigger study might also find impacts on the participants’ behaviour. In this work, exclusion didn’t affect who the participants chose to pass the ball to — there was no evidence that excluded participants tried either to “tend and befriend” their rejector, or stopped passing them the ball.</p>



<p>Though this new study is one of the first to simultaneously compare the effects of ostracism by friends/partners vs strangers, earlier studies have found that even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103103001823">ostracism by a computer</a>, or someone belonging to a detested group, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-18930-006">such as the Ku Klux Klan</a>, has negative effects.</p>



<p>All of these findings speak to the fundamental nature of the effects of ostracism on our wellbeing. Our ancestors’ lives depended on their having strong social networks — and the drive to have and preserve one, is, it seems, still with us.</p>

<p>If you live in a country with more UVB sunlight, you might have an advantage when it comes to risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunlight is used by your skin to make vitamin D, which is anti-carcinogenic. For those of us farther from the equator, we only get a little bit of UVB, usually in the middle of the day (around 10am-2pm, depending on where you live) and during summer months. By comparison, people living in countries closer to the equator are bathed in UVB year-round for most of the day.</p>

<p><strong><u>How Does Vitamin D Prevent Cancer?</u></strong></p>
<p>Vitamin D has tons of effects on cells. In cancer research, vitamin D is DINAMIT! This acronym describes the sequence of events at the cellular level when vitamin D is low. DINOMIT spells <em>disjunction, initiation, natural selection, overgrowth, metastasis, involution, </em>and<em> transition</em> (see accompanying illustration from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279709001057">Annals of Epidemiology</a>). With good vitamin D levels, cells can communicate better with their neighboring cells due to higher production of cadherin molecules. With low vitamin D levels, cells don’t know that they are surrounded by other cells, so they divide uncontrollably, causing cancer.</p>
<p><strong><u>You Might Not Notice Until You’re Older</u></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12423" style="width: 286px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12423 size-full" height="739" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/blog.png" width="276" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Garland CF et al. (2009). Vitamin D for Cancer Prevention: Global Perspective. Annals of Epidemiology 19(7):468-483.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our research published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> suggests that the anti-cancer effect of vitamin D is hard to notice in people under age 45. In this study, we analyzed the global differences in colorectal cancer, one of the most common forms of cancer. We found that younger people in low-UVB countries had nearly the same rates of cancer as younger people in high-UVB countries. However, when looking at people older than 45, those in low-UVB countries had <em>dramatically</em> higher rates of cancer than those in high-UVB countries.</p>
<p>Does this mean that you don’t need vitamin D until you’re older? Not quite. The cancer-causing effects of low vitamin D take a long time to develop. (In fact, this is a key reason that researchers didn’t see high rates of cancer in low-UVB countries until they looked at older age groups.) Young or old, vitamin D could help you prevent cancer.</p>
<p><strong><u>What Should I Do If I Don’t Live Near The Equator?</u></strong></p>
<p>If you don’t live near the equator, you may need to take additional steps to ensure you have good vitamin D levels. This can include eating high vitamin D foods (such as fatty fish and dairy) or taking a vitamin D supplement. You can also get a few extra rays of mid-day sunshine, as long as you don’t get sunburned.</p>
<p>If you do live near the equator, you probably don’t need to worry quite as much. However, if you work indoors and rarely go outside, you may want to consider alternate ways to get your vitamin D.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you live, you can ask your doctor to measure your vitamin D levels, or you can order an at-home vitamin D test. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152441">Previous research</a> suggests that 40 ng/mL is a good minimum target for cancer prevention.</p>

A deeper understanding of interactions among living things and their environment is also required to manage ecosystem services and prevent the spread of harmful pathogens worldwide. Fueled by recent technological advances, DNA and RNA from environmental samples (eDNA/eRNA) are increasingly being used to help meet this need for knowledge. The application of eDNA/eRNA methods helps us evaluate community composition and answer various questions regarding biotic interactions within and between ecosystems. Furthermore, eDNA/eRNA approaches can provide insights into direct and indirect biotic interactions and various evolutionary phenomena.</span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Poverty <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/03/the-psychological-impacts-of-poverty-digested/">can have long-lasting psychological effects</a>. But for people who live above the poverty line, expectations about how much money we should have or need, as well as decisions about what to spend our money on and what to save for the future, can all affect psychological wellbeing, too. However, some well-worn ideas about this are being challenged, as we explore here.</p>



<span id="more-42762"></span>



<p><strong>Is it true that money can’t buy you happiness?</strong></p>



<p>Received wisdom is that it can’t — at least, so long as your income already covers your basic needs plus a few conveniences, such as a car, perhaps. But according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118">a recent paper in <em>PNAS</em></a>, this is not correct. Matthew A. Killingsworth at the University of Pennsylvania analysed data from more than 33,000 employed adults in the US, who had been asked to report on their own wellbeing at random timepoints via a smartphone app. Contrary to the findings of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489?ijkey=91bd6b154afe6f351d7ae35c292086aac094d6d7&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">some highly influential earlier work</a>, the analysis of over 1.7 million reports found no evidence for a “wellbeing plateau” above an income level of US$75,000 a year. Instead, Killingsworth found that wellbeing rose with income, with incomes in this study ranging from US$15k a year to over US$480,000. “This suggests that higher incomes may still have potential to improve people’s day-to-day wellbeing,” even in wealthy countries, he writes.</p>



<p>However, it’s worth stressing that the data shows that wellbeing increases by a similar amount every time income is <em>doubled</em> — so an increase of $30,000 to $60,000, for example, is associated with a much bigger rise in happiness than an increase of $120,000 to $150,000.</p>



<p><strong>What should you buy to maximise happiness?</strong></p>



<p>Not more <em>things</em>, according to most research — but there’s a caveat to this, which we’ll get to shortly.</p>



<p>Certainly, there’s plenty of evidence that buying experiences rather than possessions makes for greater wellbeing. For example, in 2020, a team that included Killingsworth but which was led by Amit Kumar at the University of Texas, Austin <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103119305256?via=ihub">reported a study</a> of 2,635 US-based adults, who received regular texts during the day asking about their current emotions and any purchases. The researchers found that people were happier when spending on experiences, such as attending a sporting event or eating at a restaurant, than when buying goods that cost the same amount, such as jewellery or clothing.</p>



<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dd05454f1a7771855d537b7/t/5deed996f9cab80768057751/1575934359616/Hershfield_Mogilner_Barnea_InPress_SPPS.pdf">Another study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, reported that although most people say they would choose to have more money over more time, participants who chose money reported being happier (the participants’ household income and free time were taken into account in this analysis). The team did also find that happier people are more likely to choose more time vs more money. But their analysis suggests that the effect does work in both directions, with a prioritization of time vs money and greater happiness boosting each other. (The participants in this study were thousands of Americans representing a range of ages, income levels and occupations.)</p>



<p>However, there is also evidence that buying experiences and time really only makes you happier than buying objects <em>if</em> you’re already reasonably well-off, compared with those around you. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/04/the-experiential-advantage-is-not-universal-the-less-well-off-get-equal-or-more-happiness-from-buying-things/">As we reported in 2018,</a> research (yet again in the US) has shown that less well-off people get just the same — if not more — happiness from buying objects.</p>



<p><strong>How does income disparity affect happiness?</strong></p>



<p>People living in areas where incomes are more similar tend to report greater wellbeing — and this holds not just for overall high-income regions, such as Scandinavian countries, but regions where money <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244569">isn’t used much at all</a>.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of research finding that it’s not so much how much we earn (above a basic level) but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705943/">how much we earn <em>compared with those around us </em>that affects wellbeing</a>. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705943/">recent study</a> of this, a pair of researchers analysed decades worth of data from the US and also several western European countries, including the UK. They found that, in Europe especially, rising levels of income inequality were associated with <em>higher</em> levels of happiness — up to a critical point. Beyond that point, happiness dropped.</p>



<p>The researchers think that limited inequality is encouraging — people see that some social mobility is possible and expect that they might achieve it themselves. However, when income inequality becomes too high, “more aspiring individuals may replace their upward mobility dream with despair and feel jealous of the rich”.</p>



<p>“Too high” was notably higher for the US than for Europe. The researchers think this could be because even though there is lower social mobility and also greater income inequality in the US compared with western Europe, Americans are greater believers in the possibility of social mobility.</p>



<p>One last note on income inequality: highlighting it can of course be important. Certainly, there’s work finding that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/">visible reminders of inequality can make disadvantaged people more likely to want to do something about it</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What about giving money away….</strong></p>



<p>Throughout human history and across cultures, humans have helped one another in times of need — that, at least, is the message from the influential <a href="http://www.humangenerosity.org">Human Generosity Project</a>. Anthropological studies of a wide range of communities suggest that we are generous by nature. Though this research has focused on generosity within communities, we are of course also motivated to give anonymously, in the form of charitable donations. Studies in this field have found that <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/10-012_0350a55d-585b-419d-89e7-91833a612fb5.pdf">giving boosts happiness, and also that happier people give more</a>, creating a virtuous spiral of increasing benefits.</p>



<p>Other studies have investigated the factors that influence our decisions to give to charities. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11852-z">2019 paper in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, which analysed millions of dollars of donations given via the GoFundMe Platform, found that donors gave significantly more to people who shared their surname. Also, men and women donated more at times when donors of the opposite sex were visible on the screen.</p>



<p>That same year, we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/">reported on a study</a> finding that simple “moral nudges” encourage people to donate much more to charity. Nudging people to reflect on what was the morally “right thing” to do increased actual donations by close to half.</p>



<p><strong>….And keeping hold of it?</strong></p>



<p>You really want to save for a deposit on a flat, or for your retirement — but that ridiculously expensive dress, or shirt, or holiday is just <em>so</em> appealing. Most of us have experienced feelings like this. It is much harder to put money away for the future than it is to spend it now. Finding ways to close the gap that we feel between our present and future selves should help, in theory. And a questionnaire that got participants in Portugal to think more about their own future ageing did prompt them to invest more in retirement funds, reports <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12516">a 2018 study</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Social Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>Other groups have looked at different practical ways to encourage people to save. In 2020, a team led by Hal Hershfield at UCLA reported a study of thousands of new users of a financial technology app. They found that suggesting smaller, more regular deposits vs larger, less regular ones encouraged less well-off people to save. In this US study, three times as many people in the highest, compared with the lowest, income bracket signed up to make a $150 deposit each month. When this was framed as $5 per day instead, the difference in participation was eliminated (even though the total savings for each individual were, of course, the same).</p>



<p>There’s also evidence that some personality traits put you at greater risk of financial hardship and even bankruptcy. Perhaps surprisingly, one of these traits is agreeableness. The reason, according to the team behind this <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspp0000220">2018 report</a>, is that agreeable people value money less, and so are more likely to mismanage their own. “The relationship was much stronger for lower-income individuals, who don’t have the financial means to compensate for the detrimental impact of their agreeable personality,” commented co-author Joe Gladstone at UCL.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Facial expressions can be hard to read — and not just when someone is experiencing a mild emotion or feels ambivalent. Research has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/14/facial-expressions-of-intense-joy-and-pain-are-indistinguishable/">suggested</a> that when we witness someone in the throes of a particularly acute emotional state, like intense joy or pain, we find it hard to pinpoint exactly what they’re feeling.</p>



<p>A new study looks at a similar phenomenon, this time focusing on vocalisations such as laughter, cries, screams and moans. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88431-0">Writing in <em>Scientific Reports,</em></a> Natalie Holz and colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics find that our ability to identify emotions increases as vocalisations become more intense — but only to a point. When these sounds reach peak intensity, we find it surprisingly hard to classify them.</p>



<span id="more-42747"></span>



<p>Participants were split into three groups and assigned different tasks; each involved listening to non-verbal vocalisations representing different emotions and intensities. The first group focused on categorising emotions, assigning one of seven possible affective states to the sounds: anger, fear, pain, achievement, positive surprise, sexual pleasure, or none of the above. Next, participants indicated how intense they felt the emotion was, and how authentic.</p>



<p>The second group took part in an emotion <em>rating</em> task, indicating how clearly they could perceive a specified emotion in the vocalisations. And the third group rated the sounds according to their valence (how positive or negative the sound was) and arousal (how calm or intense it was). This group also indicated how authentic they felt each sound was.</p>



<p>In the emotion categorisation task, participants were largely able to correctly classify different emotions. Participants were also able to successfully identify how intense an emotion was.</p>



<p>However, there appeared to be an intensity “sweet spot” at which participants were most accurate in their classifications. Participants were able to judge emotions more accurately when they were of moderate or strong intensity compared to low intensity — but after this, when the vocalisations reached “peak” intensity, accuracy decreased again.</p>



<p><a></a>Participants also showed some confusion when it came to categorising sounds as negative or positive. Although they heard an equal number of sounds of each valence, participants often miscategorised positive expressions as negative, particularly at high intensities.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the results show that while participants were able to correctly identify intensity and arousal across the sounds, working out the exact nature and emotion expressed became more difficult as intensity reached its peak. This might be the case because of the “relevance” of certain vocalisations. If someone is expressing something at peak intensity, lead author Holz <a href="https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/press/press-releases/pressemitteilungen-detail/article/understanding-feelings-when-less-is-more-1.html">suggests</a>, “the most vital job might be to detect big events and to assess relevance. A more fine-grained evaluation of affective meaning may be secondary”.</p>



<p>In other words, extremely emotionally intense sounds indicate <em>something</em> is happening that requires our attention: what it is exactly, in that moment, may be less important and can come later on.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000073">Previous studies</a> have pinpointed clear, objective markers in intense facial expressions that in theory should allow us to determine whether they indicate positive or negative valence. In the moment, however, we frequently fail to do so. Further research could explore the cues that exist in intense emotional sounds, giving an idea of why — and how — we mix up their meaning.</p>

Another disclosure: this is far from my field of expertise. So I searched the literature. Apparently, “patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship” (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33149.short" target="_blank">Hyon et al., 2020</a>). However, that study was conducted in a small town in South Korea (total population 860), allowing a detailed social network analysis. Plus, people knew each other well and experienced many of the same day to day events, which could shape their functional connectomes. Not exactly relevant for predicting strangers' speed dating choices, eh?</p><p>Another paper identified a “global personality network” based on data from 984 participants in the Human Connectome Project (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320342" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2019</a>). The sample was large enough to support a training set of n=801 and a “hold-out” dataset (n=183) for validation purposes. The results supported the authors' “similar brain, similar personality” hypothesis. But in the dating world, how much do “similars” attract (compared to the popular saying, “opposites attract”)? Well why not construct (dis)similarity profiles between potential pairs by taking the absolute value of differences in functional connectivity (FC), and combine those with values of similarities in FC? Does that make sense?? And in order to arrive at this metric, there's a whole lot of machine learning (but with much smaller training sets)...<br /><br /><b>Identity Classification</b> </p><p>A separate sample of 44 individuals from the Human Connectome Project was used to construct the Similarity of Connectivity Pattern between pairs<span><span> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412" target="_blank">Kajimura et al., 2021</a>). These 44 participants had each been scanned twice, allowing 44 self-self pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jessica at time 2), which were compared to 44 self-other pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jennifer at time 2). Self-self “feature values” always show a positive correlation, and these were used to define “individual-specific information.”<br /><br /><b>26,680 feature values?</b>  </span></span></p><p><span><span>To start, 116 regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by Automated Anatomical Labeling (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771995/" target="_blank">AAL</a>). Pairwise comparisons of these for Self scan #1 vs. Self scan #2 (or vs. Other scan #2) resulted in a vector of 6,670 functional connectivities for each data point [(116 × 115)/2]. Then multiply this by four (!!) and you get 26,680 values fed into a machine learning classifier. Why four? Because the slow fluctuating BOLD signals were decomposed into four frequency bands for the classification procedure. Was this necessary? Does it add robustness, or merely more opportunities for false positive results?</span></span></p><p></p><p><span><span><br /></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span><span><span><span><img border="0" data-original-height="700" data-original-width="1946" height="144" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WAyb61BcXA/YNrJumqza0I/AAAAAAAANWM/82YKNqdApJE8g5xlqHwP6FNw4VafTKiWgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h144/Fig%2B3%2B-%2Btop%2B100%2Bfeature%2Bvalues.jpg" width="400" /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Fig. 3 (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412" target="_blank">Kajimura et al., 2021</a>)</b>.

Why these numbers were not perfectly matched, I do not know. The resting state fMRI scan was several days before the first speed dating session. [I'm assuming it was the first, because the Methods say there were three speed dating events. There was also a post-dating scan, which was described in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336154/" target="_blank">another paper</a>]. The three hour event was held in a large room where pairs of participants had 3 min long conversations with every member of the opposite sex. After each conversation, all the men moved to the next table. When all the speed dates were over, each person was asked to identify at least half of the opposite sex individuals they'd like to chat with again.<br /></p></span></span></span>Well, there's a problem here — a requirement to select half the dates could result in less-than-optimal choices in some individuals. This requirement was necessary for sampling purposes, but it makes you wonder about the quality of the matches. Also, there was a strong possibility of unilateral matches — one individual thinks they've found their dream partner but that feeling was not reciprocated. When both members of a pair said "yes" they were considered compatible. Out of a total of 440 possible pairs, 158 were compatible and 282 incompatible.<br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p>The Compatible vs. Incompatible comparisons are the key findings of the study (Fig. 5, with A and B panels as above). Unlike the Identity comparison, compatible male-female pairs did not show more similar functional connnectivity patterns than incompatible pairs (Fig. 5A). <br /><br />Well then...</p><p>“This indicates that the compatibility of female–male relationships is not necessarily represented by the similarity of functional connectivity patterns.”<br /><br />Yes. <br /><br />“Unlike identity classification, compatibility classification was supported by the considerable negative coefficients of the features” (shown in Fig. 6 of the paper).

Thus, I disagree with the claim that...<br /><blockquote><span><span>“</span></span>...the current results indicate that resting-state functional connectivity has information about behavioral tendencies that two individuals actually exhibit during a dyadic interaction, which cannot be measured by self-report methods and thus may remain hidden unless we use neuroimaging methods concurrently.<span><span>”</span></span></blockquote><br />To review the potential limitations of the study, we can't assess the quality of matches (meh vs. enthusiastic), we don't know what the participants were thinking about during their rsfMRI scan (see <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/node/656115.full" target="_blank">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</a>), and we don't know their mental state during the scan. Although rs-FC fMRI is often considered a stable trait”, state factors and motion artifacts can affect the results on a given day (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604231/" target="_blank">Geerligs et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, ~35% of the time, the present paper was unsuccessful in classifying the same person run on two different days (and that's excluding one of four frequencies that was not above chance).<br /><br />Is there something intrinsic encoded in BOLD signal fluctuations that can predict who we will find appealing (and a potential “match) after a three minute interaction?  Decisions at speed dating events are mostly based on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.768" target="_blank">physical attractiveness</a>, so it seems very implausible to me.<p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Further Reading (the Speed Dating Collection)</b></p><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-neuroscience-of-speed-dating-choice.html">The Neuroscience of Speed Dating Choice</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-electroencephalogram-cocktail-party.html">The Electroencephalogram Cocktail Party</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/eeg-speed-dating.html">EEG Speed Dating</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/journal-of-speed-dating-studies.html">The Journal of Speed Dating Studies</a><br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span><span><span><span><span><span><p><b>Winner of Best Title <br /></b></p><p><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780824882822-013/html" target="_blank">How I Meditated with Your Mother: Speed Dating at Temples and Shrines in Contemporary Japan</a></p></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><p> </p><p><b>References</b></p><div class="gs_citr" tabindex="0">Geerligs L, Rubinov M, Henson RN.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Research has shown many benefits to extraversion. One <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0000415">2019 study</a> on personality traits in the workplace found that extraverts are more motivated, experience more positive emotions, work harder and have fewer adverse experiences at work, while <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12387">another</a> found that extraversion was associated with more creative thinking.</p>



<p>If you’re not naturally extraverted, however, these wellbeing benefits are not necessarily out of reach. One <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/">intervention</a> suggested that acting like an extravert could bring the benefits of natural extraversion, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/29/further-evidence-that-acting-like-an-extravert-can-boost-wellbeing/">another</a> generated similar findings a year later. However, some of this work also suggests that for people who are particularly introverted, acting like an extravert could be exhausting and actually produce <em>negative</em> emotions.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211015062#_i41">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, looks in more detail at what happens when we deviate from our “baseline” levels of extraversion. The team finds that higher-than-normal levels of extraversion-related behaviours are associated with more positive feelings — even for those who aren’t extraverted to begin with.</p>



<span id="more-42734"></span>



<p>At the start of the first study, 92 participants completed a measure of trait extraversion (i.e. baseline levels of extraversion). Over the next four weeks, they then completed survey questions five times a day related to state extraversion (i.e. in-the-moment extraversion-related feelings and behaviours such as being talkative or energetic) and positive feelings, which was measured with a single question, “How are you feeling right now?”.</p>



<p>The results showed that during weeks in which participants had behaved in a more introverted way than they usually do — i.e. when their state extraversion that week was lower than the average state extraversion across the entire time period —they experienced lower levels of positive feeling. But when they behaved more <em>extraverted</em> than usual, even when their average level of extraversion was not high, they had higher levels of positive feeling. This suggests that behaving in an extraverted way may increase feelings of wellbeing.</p>



<p>The second study replicated the first — only this time, positive affect was explored in more depth: participants indicated how much they agreed with numerous statements about how they felt in the moment (for example, “at this moment, I feel inspired”) rather than simply answering one question. (This study also took place over a shorter time period, with the researchers comparing responses during two three-day periods rather than across several weeks). Again, participants reported lower levels of positive affect during periods in which they had behaved in a more introverted fashion, while in more extroverted periods they experienced higher levels — although these effects were only trends which did not reach statistical significance.</p>



<p>In these studies, behaving in a more extraverted manner than normal did not seem to have negative impacts, even for the more introverted participants, in the longer term. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/">other work </a>has found less clear-cut benefits: even if introverts experienced momentary gains in positive affect these didn’t last, and there were other troublesome impacts including fatigue and negative emotion. This may be because those previous studies had participants “act like an extravert” or behave in a way that felt unnatural to them, while in the new work the researchers simply looked at the changes in people’s behaviour on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p>As the team acknowledges, the study can’t determine the direction of causality between extraversion and positive feelings. Rather than extraverted behaviour increasing positive feelings, could it be that positive affect induces more extraverted behaviour? Future work could look more closely at the direction of this relationship.</p>



<p>If the results have made you want to boost your <em>trait </em>extraversion, it may not be so simple  —  changing your personality altogether appears to be a bit more tricky than just behaving in an extraverted way a few times a week. If you succeed in tasks designed to make you behave consistently with a particular trait, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/">one study found</a>, change can indeed occur. But trying and failing  —  which may well happen to introverts attempting to become more extraverted  —  can have the opposite effect, making people even less likely to embody certain traits.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you listen to quiet music to help you wind down before sleep? If you do, you’re following the advice of all kinds of organisations, including the US National Institutes of Health and the <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/bedtime-routine-for-adults">National Sleep Foundation</a>. However, this advice could be counter-productive, according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797621989724">new study</a> by Michael K. Scullin and colleagues at Baylor University. The work, published in <em>Psychological Medicine</em>, found that bedtime music was associated with more sleep disruptions —  and that instrumental music is even worse than music with lyrics.</p>



<span id="more-42716"></span>



<p>In the first study, 199 online participants living in the US reported on their sleep quality and music listening frequency and timing, as well as their beliefs about how this affected their sleep. Almost all — 87% — believed that music improves sleep, or at least does not disrupt it. However, the team found that more overall time spent listening to music was associated with poorer sleep and daytime sleepiness. Just over three quarters of the participants also reported experiencing frequent “earworms” — having a song or tune “stuck” and replaying in their minds. A quarter reported experiencing these during the night at least once per week, and these people were (unsurprisingly) six times as likely to report poor sleep quality. The team’s analysis suggested that listening specifically to instrumental music near bedtime was linked to more sleep-related earworms and poorer sleep quality.</p>



<p>The team then ran an experimental study on 48 young adults. After arriving at the sleep lab at 8.45pm, participants went to a quiet, dimly lit bedroom, where they completed a host of questionnaires that included measures of stress, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. They also had electrodes applied, ready for the night-time polysomnography (which recorded their brain wave activity, as well as heart rate and breathing), and reported on how relaxed, nervous, energetic, sleepy and stressed they felt.</p>



<p>At 10pm, they were given some “downtime”, with quiet music playing. Half were randomised to hear three songs: “Don’t Stop Believin’’’ by Journey, “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepsen and “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift, while the other half heard instrumental-only versions of these same songs. (The team chose these songs because they are known to cause earworms and were likely to be very familiar to the participants.)</p>



<p>Participants reported decreases in stress and nervousness and increased relaxation after listening to either set of songs, and also showed decreases in blood pressure. So — as earlier studies have also suggested — quiet music at bedtime was indeed relaxing at the time. However, a quarter of the participants woke from sleep with an earworm, and the polysomnography data showed that instrumental versions of the songs were more likely to trigger these awakenings as well as to cause other sleep disruptions, such as shifts from deeper sleep to lighter sleep. Taken together, the findings represent “causal evidence for bedtime instrumental music affecting sleep quality via inducing earworms,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The EEG data showed that the participants who woke up with an earworm had significantly greater “frontal slow oscillations” — a classic signature of memory consolidation during sleep. Earworm-associated slow oscillations were also seen in the auditory cortex, which processes sounds. Earworm awakenings seem, then, to result from the reactivation of melodies heard during the day during sleep, as part of the memory consolidation process. The team’s overall data suggests that this is more likely to happen when the melodies are heard around bedtime, and are instrumental.</p>



<p>Why instrumental-only songs should have a bigger impact than music with lyrics isn’t clear. The three songs used in this study were chosen because they were likely to be familiar. Hearing them without the lyrics might have prompted the participant’s brains to try to add the words, which might have made earworms more likely. If this is the case, all instrumental music may not have the same effect. However, the data from the first study is consistent with the idea that instrumental music generally is more of a problem.</p>



<p>This work has practical implications, of course. “Just because music listening is enjoyable does not mean that more music is always better for health outcomes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>And for anyone who finds themselves struggling with earworms at night, the researchers have a few recommendations: limit how much music you listen to during the day, and avoid listening to music before bed. Instead, perhaps spend 5-10 minutes writing out a to-do list for the next day, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758411/">earlier work involving Scullin</a> has found that this helps people to get to sleep. If you do struggle with sleep, you might also want to look into <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/10/digital-therapy-for-insomnia-shows-how-technology-can-be-harnessed-to-improve-sleep-and-mental-health/">digital interventions</a>, or even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/01/rock-a-bye-adult-study-shows-grown-ups-enjoy-better-sleep-and-memory-consolidation-in-a-rocking-bed/">a rocking bed.</a></p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>We all experience a phenomenon called “generational amnesia”, where we forget the ways in which previous generations shaped the world</strong>. And that makes it harder to solve global problems like climate change, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210623-generational-amnesia-the-memory-loss-that-harms-the-planet">writes Richard Fisher</a> at <em>BBC Future</em>: if we think of the state of the world in our own youth as the “baseline”, then it’s harder to recognise long-term climate trends or declines in animal populations, for instance.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have found that greying hairs can become their original colour again.</strong> The small study showed that the point at which a hair turns grey often coincides with a period of stress, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gray-hair-can-return-to-its-original-color-mdash-and-stress-is-involved-of-course/">reports Diana Kwon</a> at <em>Scientific American</em> — and that it can sometimes return to its previous colour during a particularly relaxing time.</p>

<p><em>Pseudomonas fragi</em> A13BB, recovered as part of study to identify novel antibiotic-producing bacterial strains from soil samples collected from the rhizosphere, has been sequenced for antibiotic producing gene clusters and has been published as the <a href="https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0">first Data </a><a href="https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0">Note</a> in <em>BMC Genomic Data</em>.  Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are one of the components of the rhizosphere, where they promote plant growth by enhancing uptake of nutrients, inorganic elements, or by increasing resistance to heavy metals, high salt concentrations, phytopathogens and more.</p>
<p>Two β-lactone secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGC) known for their antibiotic, antiobesity and anticancer properties, were identified and demonstrated low homology (20%) to known smBGCs. A siderophore (a small compound secreted usually to transfer iron across cell membranes) smBGC was identified even though <em>P. fragi</em> is considered a non-siderophore producing member of the genus <em>Pseudomonas.</em></p>

<p>This <a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-021-00416-4">study</a> was intended to identify trends in the variety and amount of imported sweetened beverages (SB) to Pacific Island countries (and the impact of the SB taxes on imports in Fiji and Tonga). A major cause of death and sickness in these countries is nutrition-related chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The authors found there was an increase in SB imports into pacific island countries between these dates which needs to be considered for health implications by both exporting and importing countries as this has a detrimental impact on diet and self-sufficiency. Diet high in processed foods is well known to have an impact on health. There was a statistically significant increase in SB imports to Tonga but too little data for assessment of taxes.</p>

<p>Thirty five members of NHS secondary mental health services (England) undertook an interview based study and were found to face difficulties that impacted significantly on their well-being during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The lockdown in England in response to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-19 had impact on all Healthcare workers but that on the mental Healthcare workers has been under-reported. The quality of life for respondents was affected by their challenge of providing care in constrained and potentially dangerous situations and losing patients to the disease. Taking on additional tasks to provide a better service for their patients led to additional strain. Feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout were all reported. The response to the pandemic meant that services had to rapidly adapt to major incident mode at the same time as the needs of service users increased. Moral injury has resulted to some after exposure to this event.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-021-03261-8">study</a> has pointed to areas where additional support could be targeted. One Implication is loss of staff but this has not been explicitly stated.</p>

<p>Cells from donors with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can now be grown into brain organoids and the resulting research is opening up our understanding of the aetiology of ASD. Brain organoids are allowing the exploration into genetic, developmental and other factors involved which makes this unique from other forms of research. Researchers often incorporate the medical model of disability into ASD research.</p>
<p>The neurodiversity movement is likely to disagree with approaches and aims of cerebral research in ASD as the developmental disability movement and paradigm understands autism as a form of human diversity and advocates a model based on social, attitudinal, and environmental barriers rather than any deficits.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00627-1">authors</a> give three recommendations that should minimise any conflict and achieve a more holistic, inclusive approach to cerebral organoid research on ASD.</p>
<p>1 – neurodiverse individuals should be included as co-creators in both the scientific process and research communication.</p>
<p>2 – clinicians and neurodiverse communities should have open and respectful communication.</p>
<p>3 – a continual reconceptualization of illness, impairment, disability, behavior, and person should be achieved.</p>
<p>Researchers are advised to be careful not to combine disease with impairment or disability and also consider how best to communicate their ideas with respect and care.</p>

<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as impaired glucose tolerance with onset or first recognized during pregnancy. It is fairly prevalent with a figure of 15-20% reported globally. Hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_12445" style="width: 233px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12445" height="149" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/640px-Pregnancy_-_belly.jpg" width="223" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Towle Neu, CC BY 2.5 via Wikimedia Commons</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Vitamin and mineral supplementation such as vitamin D, vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium  may regulate glucose metabolism and have beneficial roles in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress.; does it help in GDM? The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with GDM have not been well established but this <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-021-00712-x">meta-analysis</a> hoped to rectify that.</p>
<p>The Authors’ findings are that vitamin and mineral supplementation; magnesium, zinc, selenium, calcium, vitamin D and E (alone or in combination), significantly improved glycemic control, lessened inflammation and oxidative stress in women with GDM through decreasing serum Fasting Plasma Glucose, insulin, and other levels, and increasing total antioxidant capacity levels.</p>

<p>We’re always evolving our services to make sharing discoveries as easy as possible for researchers. To help authors save time and effort in the article submission process, all PLOS journals offer format-free initial submission for authors submitting research articles. Learn more about this service before you get started on your next submission.</p>



<p><strong>What is Format-Free Submission?</strong></p>



<p>Format-free submission is part of our 3-step submission process which includes:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Initial submission. </strong>Participating journals waive all formatting requirements and will request formatting changes only after initial editorial evaluation or initial peer review depending on the journal. Simply upload your manuscript in a single PDF file (which can include text and figures) and submit to the journal’s online submission system. </li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Editorial assessment. </strong>Our editors and reviewers review and provide initial feedback on your submission as quickly as possible.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Full submission. </strong>Make any additional formatting changes only after initial feedback is received. </li></ol>



<p>Together, these 3 steps are designed to help ease initial submission so you spend as little time in the article submission process as possible. </p>



<p><strong>Getting started</strong></p>



<p>To ensure your format-free submission is complete and gets handled as quickly as possible, be sure to review the submission checklists and guidelines provided by our journal editorial teams. Click a journal name below to learn more:</p>

<p>Psychology is great at confirming — or challenging — all the old sayings.

<p>Now <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211019923">a paper</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science </em>has investigated whether “revenge is sweet”.

Eder and colleagues at Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg find that people do seem to get something positive out of exacting revenge — but it can leave a bitter aftertaste too.</p>



<span id="more-42669"></span>



<p>Some studies have found that retaliation can make the victim of a transgression feel better. But other work suggests that people overestimate how good revenge will make them feel, or that they actually end up feeling bad.</p>



<p>Perhaps it does both, reasoned the authors of the new study: you might feel good straight after taking revenge, but the very act of retaliation could remind you of the original transgression and make you feel a bit miserable. If that’s the case, then you’d expect that “sweet” feeling to be an immediate, fleeting response, which might not show up if you just ask people about their feelings. So instead, the team decided to test people’s responses to enacting revenge using a more indirect measure.</p>



<p>Participants played a game testing their reaction times, supposedly against two other players via the internet (unbeknownst to the participants, these other “players” weren’t real). Before each round, they had to nominate one of the other players to be blasted with noise if they won. But if they lost, they either received a sound blast themselves from the winning player, or saw the other losing player receive the sound blast. (In reality, who won or lost was determined solely by the computer). Crucially, one of the players picked on the participant when they won, usually blasting the participant with sound rather than the other player, while the other player didn’t show a preference.</p>



<p>Participants also completed a “punishment” task. They saw images of the two other players with a border that quickly alternated between the two pictures, and had to hit a key when it highlighted the player they wanted to punish (again, with a loud noise). If participants were out for revenge, then presumably they would choose to punish the player who had been picking on them. But for a few of the trials — unknown to the participants – the computer made the decision for them, half the time choosing to punish the provoking player and half the time choosing the non-provoking player. These were the trials the researchers were interested in.</p>



<p>Finally, after each trial participants completed the “affect misattribution procedure”. This involves viewing a Chinese character and rating it as pleasant or unpleasant — it’s considered an indirect measure of how a participant is feeling at that point in time.</p>



<p>The team found that people were more likely to rate Chinese characters as pleasant after they punished the player who had been picking on them than after they punished the non-provoking player. But this was only true of participants who showed “revenge-seeking” behaviour (i.e. those who chose to blast the provoking player more often with noise). So the results suggested that revenge-seeking people do feel more positive after taking revenge against someone who has wronged them.</p>



<p>But an alternative interpretation was that participants felt <em>worse</em> after punishing the non-provoking player. To figure out whether this was the case, in a second study the team added an option to not punish either player. Revenge-seeking participants again rated the Chinese characters as more pleasant after punishing the provoking player compared to the non-provoking player. But, interestingly, their response was even <em>more </em>positive when no-one was punished.</p>



<p>The results show that revenge “is neither wholly sweet nor wholly bitter”, the authors conclude. People generally feel bad after punishing someone, they write — but if they are taking revenge on a transgressor then they experience a certain amount of pleasure which counteracts some (but not all) of those bad feelings.</p>



<p>There are some obvious limitations to the study. As the authors note, it’s unclear exactly what processes are at play when rating Chinese characters (in fact, some researchers have argued that people’s responses on this test are not as “implicit” as assumed). And of course, transgressions and acts of revenge in real life are going to be very different from this artificial, lab-based task. Still, it’s an interesting piece of research that shows that our feelings and behaviours are far more nuanced than the old sayings imply.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about a paper "A Spiking Neural Program for Sensorimotor Control during Foraging in Flying Insects".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral
strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been
described in detail for various species. To explore the link between
underlying neural circuits and computational principles, we present
how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect
mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning, and motor
control. We focus on cast and surge strategies employed by flying
insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-
based plasticity rule, the model rapidly learns to associate
individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical
conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system
dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex
sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time
scales generates cast-and-surge motor commands. Our generic systems
approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning,
while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and
precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological
computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows
how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic
conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as
inspiration for agent-based machine learning.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Across the world, birth rates are dropping. The global fertility rate <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">has halved since 1950</a>, with indications that this will continue to fall. There are a number of suggestions as to why this is the case: women may stay in education or the workforce rather than have multiple children, for instance, and many people across the world now have much greater access to contraception.</p>



<p>But many adults are also explicitly deciding not to have children, instead choosing to be “childfree”. The childfree movement has grown rapidly over the last few years: the ‘<a href="https://reddit.com/r/childfree">r/Childfree</a>’ subreddit has over 1.4 million subscribers, whilst <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/childfree">media</a> <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/fertility-women-over-30-child-free-life-lessons/474526">coverage</a> has <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html">proliferated</a> in the UK and US.</p>



<p>But are the childfree missing out on the joys that come from parenthood? According to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252528">new study</a> published in <em>PLOS One</em>, that isn’t the case: childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents.</p>



<span id="more-42647"></span>



<p>Participants, 1000 adults from Michigan in the United States, were either parents, child<em>less</em> (had no children but wanted them) or child<em>free</em> (had no children and didn’t want them). They completed several scales, including measures of life satisfaction and of the Big Five personality traits, before rating on a scale from 0 to 100 how cold or warm they felt towards both women and men who do not ever want to have biological or adopted children. Finally, the team also collected demographic data, including information on participants’ race, gender, education, age, political ideology and relationship status — whether someone was partnered, formerly partnered (e.g. divorced, separated or widowed) or single.</p>



<p>Over a quarter of participants were childfree, the second biggest group after parents. At first, it appeared that childfree participants had lower life satisfaction than parents — but this difference disappeared after controlling for gender, education, age and relationship status.</p>



<p>Childfree participants were also more likely to be left-wing or liberal compared to parents. “Not yet parents” — those who did not have children yet but hoped to in the future — were slightly more agreeable than childfree participants, but there were no other differences in personality between the groups.</p>



<p>Warmness towards childfree women and men also depended on the parenting status of participants. Childfree people felt warmer towards childfree women and men while childless individuals and parents felt significantly colder.</p>



<p>A common refrain on forums such as r/Childfree is that many parents insinuate — or say outright — that their childfree counterparts couldn’t possibly be as happy as them. This research seems to suggest that isn’t the case. However, despite the fact that childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents, they are still considered by others to be an outgroup, with parents and childless individuals feeling significantly colder towards them than other childfree people.</p>



<p>Further research could look at the variety of reasons why people choose not to have children: in this study, personality didn’t seem to make much of a difference while political ideology did, so exploring the direction of this effect may be interesting. Whether it’s to do with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/08/why-i-dont-have-a-child-i-dont-have-enough-money">finances</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis">environment</a>, or gender roles, looking more closely at the political, economic and social factors that lead people to becoming childfree could give insight into the complex components of the decision to have — or not have — children.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="90" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/logo-bmcproc-pr-140x90.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Greater inclusion of individuals from underrepresented demographics in STEM fields has long been a goal for many disciplines. As the culture of STEM evolves towards greater inclusivity, providing equitable access to talented individuals of all backgrounds has become a key priority. Diversity not only in academic expertise but in demographics is increasingly recognized as a source of collective strength that correlates with success and innovation.</p>
<p>Scientific societies have historically sought to cultivate diverse membership through an educational model that supports scientist participation in activities that prepare them for upcoming career transitions. While this methodology is broadly applied across many different disciplines, societies are now coordinating their efforts and using data to evaluate outcomes and identify <a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0262">opportunities</a> to improve impact.</p>
<p>In the process, scientific societies have found themselves well-suited to offer field-specific career development opportunities that complement the traditional instruction and training provided at academic institutions. Trainees in the process of developing into independent academic scientists must cultivate a combination of disciplinary knowledge and complementary soft skills in order to navigate demands such as grant-writing, collaboration, mentoring, and publishing—skills that are fundamental to success in the professoriate.</p>
<p>Scientists from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM are less likely to have access to mentoring, making it more challenging to develop the soft skills necessary to facilitate success as tenure-track faculty. Scientific society professional development programming geared towards these scientists can have an equalizer effect, enabling them to successfully build their academic niche and professorial career in field areas of interest to <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">BioMed Central</a> (BMC) such as science, technology, engineering and medicine. The <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v21i1.1941">Minorities Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell Biology</a> (ASCB) has a strong track record of creating professional development programs to help relieve these disparities in access to mentoring.</p>
<p>One example of ASCB MAC programming is its <a href="https://www.ascb.org/career-development/2021-accomplishing-career-transitions-act-program/">Accomplishing Career Transitions (ACT) program</a>. ACT engages cell biologists who are starting out their independent careers to individualize their professional development and training through a longitudinal mentoring framework. ASCB aims to prepare ACT Fellows for a successful transition into the academic STEM workforce.</p>
<p>Our new BMC Proceedings Supplement, highlights topics including effective mentorship, obtaining a faculty position, starting a lab, preparing for tenure and promotion, and professional development through experiential learning.</p>
<p>The content of this BMC Proceedings Supplement is more important now than ever, as rising faculty adapt their career trajectories to global challenges. Our short term goal with this <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-15-supplement-2">BMC Proceedings Supplement</a> is to make the ACT program available to a wider range of  scientists to help them prepare for success in academia. Their success will contribute to a diverse professoriate that is inclusive and welcoming of the next generation of scientists.</p>

<p>Take a look at this 1930 painting, “Rhythm, Joy of Life”, by French artist Robert Delaunay. Do you find it colourful? And do you like it?</p>

<p>Now what if every pixel in a digital version was rotated an equal distance on a “colour wheel” that represents every colour that people can see? Technically, the number of different colours in the image would be the same — but you’d probably perceive it to be <em>less</em> colourful. And, even if you’d never seen the original before, you’d probably like it less.  That, at least, is the conclusion of a fascinating <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf">new paper </a>in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance</em>. The work contributes to our understanding not only of why certain colours are more common in art, but also of how we perceive colour.</p>



<span id="more-42625"></span>



<p>Carolin S. Altmann and colleagues at the Experimental Aesthetics Group at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany, first identified 100 colourful abstract artworks by well-known artists. They then rotated each through a 360-degree wheel of perceivable colours, in steps of 60 degrees at a time. This gave them six differently coloured digital versions of each artwork, so 600 images in total. Twenty young participants with normal vision used six-point scales to rate each version of every artwork for “colourfulness” and, separately (on another day), for how much they liked them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42631" data-attachment-id="42631" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rotations" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;ssl=1" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="513,682" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/21/we-like-the-original-versions-of-abstract-artworks-more-than-colour-shifted-ones/rotations/" data-recalc-dims="1" height="506" src="https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?resize=381%2C506&amp;ssl=1" width="381" />Rotated versions of “Rhythm, Joy of Life” used in the study. From <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf">Altman <em>et al</em> (2021)</a></figure></div>



<p>The team found that all but one of the participants felt the originals to be more colourful than the other versions. Also, about three quarters of the participants preferred the originals over the colour-shifted versions. “This effect is not only surprisingly consistent across participants, but also across images, and even survived rigorous statistical control of potentially confounding factors,” the team reports. In fact, 81% of the original images were both more liked and judged to be more colourful. The team’s analysis also revealed that the participants didn’t simply like very colourful images per se — rather, “they prefer versions of artworks that they perceive as more colourful”.</p>



<p>Each rotation included the same number of perceivable colours. So — assuming that the participants were unfamiliar with the artworks (and this isn’t reported on in the paper) — there must be something special about the colour palettes chosen by the artists, the team reasoned.</p>



<p>Their analysis revealed that three quarters of the artworks featured more yellow and orange than other hues. (This was also the case for another 113 artworks that the team had originally identified for possible inclusion in the study). Other research has also found find a bias among artists towards the yellow/orange range. So why might this be?</p>



<p>More yellow in a picture might make it seem closer to a scene lit by natural daylight (even if it’s an abstract image), and so preferred, the researchers suggest. But also, the human visual system is less sensitive to blueish-yellowish input than to red, say. (It’s been suggested that this made it easier for our ancestors to quickly spot reddish ripe fruit under changing light levels, from dawn to dusk.) “Potentially, artists thus have to overrepresent yellow colours in their palette to make them just as noticeable to the human observer as other colour hues with higher perceptual sensitivity,” the team writes.</p>



<p>“Yellow” is also a narrow “colour category”. That is, the number of different hues that we perceive to be examples of yellow is pretty narrow; it’s much larger for red, say. So while a rotation may easily have changed a yellow pixel to one in another colour category, a red pixel may still be a type of “red” — which could make the artwork <em>seem</em> to be less colourful and also less complex. Other studies have found that more complex artworks tend to get higher aesthetic ratings, so more apparently complex versions of the same painting might be preferred.</p>



<p>Not all languages use the same colour categories, however. For example, “light blue” and “dark blue” are fundamentally different categories in Russian and Greek — in which a colour cannot simply be called “blue”. It has been suggested that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/">the colour categories that a person is familiar with affects their colour perception</a>. It would be interesting, then, to see if a study using participants who use different colour categories would give different results.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the majority of participants in this study were women, and other work has found that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/men-and-women-see-things-differently-literally-180954815/">men and women don’t perceive colours in quite the same way</a>. There are, then, still a lot of questions in relation to this work — but it’ll be really interesting to see what the answers turn out to be. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/06/18/predicting-kidney-failure/">Predicting Kidney Failure</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/iStock-1209664248.t5fce49ac.m800.eps_.pv_.xPOr4FnnT-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) was first assessed by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21482743/">Tangri <em>et al</em></a>. in 2011.  It was then multi-nationally evaluated in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26757465/">2016</a>.  I frequently use their <a href="https://kidneyfailurerisk.com/">online calculator</a> to help counsel my patients in clinic but more so as informational to relieve patient concerns, and not to drive clinical practice.  The KFRE predicts the 2- and 5-year risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a-5.  There are two forms of the equation: 4-variable and 8-variable.  The 4-variable includes age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria.  The 8-variable has these components but also incorporates serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, and bicarbonate.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02402-1">Ali <em>et al</em>.</a> set out to validate the KFRE in advanced CKD taking into account their cause of CKD (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other causes.  The KFRE performed well across all diseases and was found to have adequate discrimination and calibration.  What I found to be very interesting was that the KFRE provided better clinical utility for decision-making like pre-ESKD planning than basing it on GFR cutoffs alone.  Typically, we start planning for transplant evaluations, dialysis education, dialysis access placement, etc when the <a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(15)01019-7/pdf">eGFR is &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2</a> (in this study they used &lt; 20 and &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2).  with using the KFRE in Ali <em>et al.</em>, they identified more patients who were likely to progress to ESKD and delay in others by using KFRE thresholds of &gt; 40% for 2-year risk and &gt; 50% for 5-year risk of ESKD.</p>
<p>Identifying patients who are progressing to ESKD is kept in planning for dialysis modality, access placement, and transplant referral.  If we can catch individuals early and start the process then there are fewer hospitalizations and poor outcomes.  Other studies have addressed using the KFRE in the necessity of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835850/">nephrology referrals</a> and using it as a risk-based approach to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375884">guide CKD care</a>.</p>
<p>Based on my review of the literature and Ali <em>et al</em>.’s article, I definitely will start using the KFRE in my clinical assessment and planning for patients with advanced CKD.  Maybe it will help identify those patients who will benefit from early referral to transplant and access placement or at the least early education endeavors for those patients.  I can only see positives from using the KFRE as another clinical tool.</p>
<p>What are other additional uses of the KFRE in your practice?</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Have you noticed an increase in scam texts recently?</strong> I certainly have — and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic">so has David Robson</a>, writing at <em>BBC Future</em>.  These scammers often make it seem like we are facing some immediate threat like legal trouble or loss of money, capitalising on the fact that in this kind of situation we are less likely to think and act rationally. And the pandemic has provided just the right conditions for these scams to flourish, Robson writes.</p>

<p><strong>As we mentioned </strong><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/04/magic-tricks-and-media-literacy-the-weeks-best-psychology-links/"><strong>a couple of weeks ago</strong></a><strong>, the idea that groups succumb to “groupthink” is hotly contested.</strong> This week at <em>Wired</em>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-humans-think-when-they-think-group/">Annie Murphy Paul takes a look at the more positive side of group cognition</a>, drawing on a fascinating case study in which sailors on board an out-of-control aircraft carrier worked together to narrowly avert disaster. </p>

<p><strong>An Australian study has found that primary-aged kids perform better when their schools are surrounded by more green spaces. </strong>It’s not simply the case that these schools are attended by children from wealthier families, <a href="https://theconversation.com/green-space-around-primary-schools-may-improve-students-academic-performance-161673">write the researchers Alison Carver and Amanda J Wheeler</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>, because the research compared schools with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Instead, the pair suggests that the effect could be related to reduced pollution near schools with more greenery, or de-stressing effects of the green spaces themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Could brands one day insert advertisements into your dreams?</strong> That’s the fear of a group of dream researchers, who have released an open letter calling for “dream manipulation” to be regulated, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/are-advertisers-coming-your-dreams">reports Sofia Moutinho</a> at <em>Science</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have found that when exposed to the common antidepressant citalopram, crayfish become bolder, emerging out of their shelters more readily to look for food. </strong>The study was conducted in the lab, but used levels of antidepressants which have previously been found in streams, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/antidepressant-pollution-in-water-may-make-crayfish-bolder">reports Douglas Main</a> at <em>National Geographic</em>.

<p>We’re pleased to announce a new arXivLabs collaboration with <a href="https://www.litmaps.co/">Litmaps</a>. The new <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXivLabs</a> feature allows arXiv users to quickly generate a citation map of the top connected articles, and then explore the citation network using the Litmaps research platform.</p>
<p>A citation network is a visualization of the literature cited by a research paper. The network shows how papers are related to each other in terms of concepts, subject areas, and history — and they’re valuable for <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">analyzing the development of research areas, making decisions on research directions, and assessing the impacts of research, researchers, institutes, countries, and individual papers.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Readers can now view a Litmap citation network for a specific paper, directly from the arXiv abstract page by clicking on the “Bibliographic Tools” tab at the bottom of an abstract page and activating “Litmaps.” Using this tool, arXiv readers can now easily jump from articles they are interested in and use Litmaps’ custom visualization and automated search tools to find other critical articles they may have missed.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1038" style="width: 466px;"><img alt="screenshot of litmaps tool on arXiv abstract page" class="size-full wp-image-1038" height="424" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/06/Litmaps-Screenshot.png" width="466" />From an arXiv abstract page, readers can activate the Litmaps tool to view citation networks</figure>

<p>“We are excited to be able to offer arXiv readers new visual ways to explore scientific literature. Litmaps will enrich the arXiv reading experience and help readers find what they need,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv.</p>
<p>This tool supports arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>
<p>“We are arXiv users ourselves at Litmaps, so it’s great to be able to collaborate and integrate with arXiv, which is a key resource for the research community,” said Axton Pitt, cofounder of Litmaps. The company aims to make the process of literature discovery easy and fun, and welcomes feedback via <a href="https://twitter.com/LitmapsApp">Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:team@litmaps.co">email</a>.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Bente Riegler will talk about a paper "Toward a New Theory of Motor Synergies".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Driven by recent empirical studies, we offer a new understanding of
the degrees of freedom problem, and propose a refined concept of
synergy as a neural organization that ensures a one-to-many mapping of
variables providing for both stability of important performance
variables and flexibility of motor patterns to deal with possible
perturbations and/or secondary tasks. Empirical evidence is reviewed,
including a discussion of the operationalization of
stability/flexibility through the method of the uncontrolled manifold.
We show how this concept establishes links between the various
accounts for how movement is organized in redundant effector systems.</p>

<p><img alt="Image of the CVF logo with white letters on a blue background" class="alignright wp-image-1029 size-medium" height="193" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/06/CVF-logo-300x193.jpg" width="300" />With a generous donation of $125,000, <a href="https://www.thecvf.com/">The Computer Vision Foundation</a> becomes <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv’s</a> first 2021 Gold Affiliate. The foundation fosters and supports research on all aspects of computer vision, a field of study that develops techniques to see and interpret the visual world, with applications ranging from diagnosing disease to evaluating agricultural crop quality.</p>
<p>“We didn’t donate because we were asked,” said Ramin Zabih, president and founder of CVF, Cornell Tech professor, and Google research scientist. “We donated because we love arXiv.”</p>
<p>Open access is a central tenet of the foundation, which (along with <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>) cosponsors the two main computer vision conferences, <a href="http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/">CVPR</a> and <a href="http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home">ICCV</a>. Before the pandemic, CVPR drew more than 10,000 attendees. CVF also provides open access to the proceedings for these conferences.</p>
<p>“Without arXiv, the computer vision field would not advance at anything close to its current speed,” said Zabih. Conferences and journals are both useful venues for presenting and peer reviewing results. But the pace of research is fast, and arXiv provides an invaluable vehicle for rapid research sharing between conference and journal cycles. Plus, while the high bar for acceptance to conferences and journals serves an important purpose, arXiv provides a platform for lesser-known researchers to make their mark. “High profile researchers will always have ways to share their work, say, by being invited to give talks. arXiv levels the playing field,” said Zabih.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">arXiv recently launched an updated sustainability model</a>, which distributes arXiv’s operational costs fairly across our dedicated community. This donation was the first Gold Affiliate through this sustainability model and is a continuation of The Computer Vision Foundation’s support, which began in 2019.</p>
<p>Like earlier donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Heising-Simons Foundation, and Google, Inc, this contribution supports arXiv’s critical infrastructure improvements and integration with the scholarly communications landscape.</p>
<p>“arXiv has been operating in maintenance mode for quite some time,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv’s executive director. “With generous support from organizations like The Computer Vision Foundation, arXiv can innovate for the future.”</p>

Abstract:  The goal of the open access (OA) movement is to help everyone access the scholarly research, not just those who can afford to. However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research. This study sought to answer whether the news media mentions OA articles more or less than paywalled articles by looking at articles published from 2010 through 2018 in journals across all four quartiles of the Journal Impact Factor using data obtained through Altmetric.com and the Web of Science. Gold, green and hybrid OA articles all had a positive correlation with the number of news mentions received. News mentions for OA articles did see a dip in 2018, although they remained higher than those for paywalled articles.

<p>So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is <em>research</em>.</p>

<p>Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I’m working on in the broadest sense, “How does the brain work?”, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?</p>



<p>Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing. However, I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to “invent” new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.”<br /><br />“Because I always know what I’m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn’t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I’m only aware of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok">interviews in German</a> without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?</p>



<p>To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There’s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to embrace them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.</p>



<p>It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.</p>



<p>Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.</p>



<p>These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than “pure” research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of “aims”. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.</p>



<p>However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods – but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. </p>



<p>I think that also researchers in “hard” sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Actively advancing the SDGs – an exciting, challenging and rewarding journey  </strong></p>
<p>Tod<em><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12430" height="170" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/SDG2-300x170.jpg" width="300" /></em>ay’s societal challenges are complex. Tackling the complexity requires that researchers with diverse backgrounds actively work together. Transdisciplinary research provides exciting opportunities to unravel the complexity and explore solutions. Over the past two decades, I have been privileged to work at the interface of these challenges – at the global, African and country-level. I have also trained a cadre of professionals in adopting transdisciplinary mindsets.</p>
<p>My research and policy work focuses primarily on <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/">SDG 2</a> that seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this SDG touches all other SDGs and underpins the human rights fundamental to achieving all other SDGs.</p>
<p>A significant challenge in working on SDG2 is the diverse understandings of its components. I have found that the essential starting point is to make sure everyone around the table understands what we are discussing – in meetings with communities, policymakers or researchers. Assuming everyone is on the same page is a monumental mistake. Even in the international domain, SDG2 is often incorrectly labelled ‘ending hunger’ – only one element of SDG2. Hunger is an extreme (acute) form of food insecurity but also includes other outcomes such as malnutrition and the complexities of the coexistence of undernourishment and obesity in poor communities.</p>
<p>Some of these misconceptions relate to views that food security relates only to production rather than considering the inter-linked core elements of food security: <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf">availability, access, nutrition, resilience, agency and sustainability</a>. Yet, this 1970’s production perspective has changed with our <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974">deeper understanding of food insecurity and its causes</a>. Malnutrition is often understood as undernutrition rather than embracing all forms of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies (often termed ‘hidden hunger’) and overweight (including obesity).</p>
<p>Moreover, food security is <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0457-6.pdf">not a static condition</a>. Households can become more or less food insecure over time or seasons. Simultaneously achieving the four inter-linked elements of the SDG2 is the focus of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit">September 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit</a>. All four elements of SDG2 are outcomes of sustainable food systems but require specific actions to ensure that the elements of food systems work together to deliver on SDG2. The food systems approach provide ‘<a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/action-tracks">lenses’</a> to examine the effectiveness of food system components and stakeholders. Food systems approaches can help identify opportunities to address failures and tradeoffs in the system.</p>
<p>The field of study related to SDG2 is changing rapidly, making research in this field exciting, challenging and rewarding.  Working in this field has led to opportunities to work with diverse international transdisciplinary teams. From these treasured engagements, I have learnt an enormous amount about many topics that touch on, underly and shape research on SDG2. These opportunities have included drafting <a href="https://www.interacademies.org/publication/opportunities-future-research-and-innovation-food-and-nutrition-security-and">consensus reports</a> with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvN2O14zxAhXGiVwKHb5TDu4QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamopanel.org%2Fresources%2FNutrition%2Freports-and-briefings%2Fnourished-how-africa-can-build-future-free-hunger2%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mmaru-77mGAncdaz1WLfB">regional</a> and <a href="http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/hlpe-reports/en/">international foci</a> to direct scientific input into international processes such as the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.48565/scfss2021-wg92">United Nations Food Systems Summit preparation</a> to embarking on <a href="https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf">challenging research analysis</a> with relatively large teams of international experts. My work enabled participation in the drafting of the United Nations High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, which first <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3901e.pdf">defined food systems in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Through these opportunities, one learns how to share your own knowledge in a way that others outside of your field of expertise can understand while building your own knowledge from the engagement with others. Such engagement requires flexibility in thinking and the willingness to expand your scope of knowledge. It requires a great deal of listening and learning – something that does not come naturally to Professors.</p>
<p>While there are only nine years left before the end of the SDG era (2016 – 2030), we still have so much to learn about how to face, embrace and overcome the complexity of the issues related to SDG2. I believe that the opportunities afforded by the digital connectivity during the COVID pandemic have helped significantly advance our understanding of SDG2 in the context of food systems. The continual engagement by a range of stakeholders with the UN Food Systems Summit preparation has enabled the identification of ‘<a href="https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/news/food-systems-game-changers-reflections">game changing’</a> solutions to advance progress on the SDGs. These solutions offer guidance on the future directions for researchers committed to supporting progress on the SDGs and SDG2 in particular. There are also opportunities for researchers to track the implementation and effectiveness of the solutions chosen by food systems stakeholders – albeit countries or the private sector. Stepping up to these opportunities will inform progress towards 2030 and provide the evidence base to inform the subsequent development era (post the SDGs).</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper "Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/06/09/my-stack-for-research-ml-projects/">My stack for research ML projects</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap">For the past few months, I’ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. </p>



<p>At that scale, it’s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that’s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/trends">25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code</a>, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don’t want to support it.</p>



<p>Here’s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.</p>

<h2>Decision points</h2>



<h3>Local vs. cloud</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a> class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn’t mean you’re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.</p>



<p>I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn’t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using <strong>paperspace gradient</strong> for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called <em>experiments</em> which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn’t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/">AWS Batch</a>, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.</p>



<h3>Code organization</h3>



<p>One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a <strong>docker</strong> container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. </p>



<p>This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea – you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won’t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn’t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></strong>, using <strong><a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a></strong> as an autoformatter.</p>



<p>If you’re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you’re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity – and then some – is to switch to <strong><a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html">test-driven development</a></strong>. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don’t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn’t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.</p>



<p>I enabled <strong><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> (CI)</strong> in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn’t end up using it. It does look like it’s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via <a href="https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g">nvidia-docker</a>.</p>



<p>I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html">PyRSE</a>. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">I ended up using the <strong>datascience cookiecutter</strong></a> for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).</p>



<h3>TF vs. PyTorch</h3>



<p>I’ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use <strong>PyTorch</strong> this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider <a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">PyTorch Lightning</a>.</p>



<h3>Storing results</h3>



<p>One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don’t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. </p>



<p>Ideally, you’d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:</p>



<ul><li>each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)</li><li>you can safely delete stale results</li><li>you can query results to find the subet which you’re interested in</li><li>you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)</li></ul>



<p>You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using <strong><a href="http://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a></strong> (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7695" data-attachment-id="7695" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" data-orig-size="3026,1560" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-4-3/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png" /></a>Wandb dashboard</figure>



<p>You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a></strong>, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.</p>



<p>Locally, I do still use <strong>tensorboard</strong> to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it’s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it’s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) – pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.</p>



<h3>Analyzing results</h3>



<p>I use <strong>jupyterlab</strong> locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don’t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn’t play well with git – the diffs are meaningless. I will try out <strong><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a></strong>, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. </p>



<h2>Mistakes I made</h2>



<p>I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. </p>



<p>That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading – some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format – I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. </p>



<p><strong>What I should have done</strong> is have one true intermediate format – e.g. <strong><a href="https://www.nwb.org/">NWB</a></strong> – I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a <strong>FAIR</strong> format in the intermediate stage – it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats – I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits – two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.</p>



<p>I experimented a bit with using <strong>make</strong> to create the intermediate format, and I think it’s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don’t exist but won’t try to recreate them if they’re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. </p>



<h2>Releasing code and models</h2>



<p>I didn’t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It’s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of <strong><a href="https://github.com/replicate/cog">cog</a></strong>, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on <strong><a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a></strong> (free bandwidth!)</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/EL0A36lyw1M/">The Ocean Womxn program – supporting a new generation of black oceanographers</a></h4>

<p>The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime location to conduct oceanographic research and features a wealth of scientific expertise. However, as in many institutions, the pool of oceanographic researchers can be quite homogenous. UCT researchers <a href="https://katyealtieri.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Katye Altieri</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Fawcett</a> and <a href="http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Isabelle Ansorge</a> realized that while the academic staff in the Department of Oceanography at UCT is comprised of ~50% womxn, it is 100% white. Furthermore, in 2019, amongst postgraduates in the department, there were only 12 Black African and Coloured South African womxn out of 73 students. The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of ‘otherness’ can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community. Altieri says that she and her colleagues saw an opportunity to create “a dedicated programme that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south”. The three womxn joined forces with <a href="http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsleter-archives/2011/february2011/doc05" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Juliet Hermes</a> from the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and they decided to apply for a grant from the Advancing Womxn initiative, created by UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamokgethi_Phakeng" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mamokgethi Phakeng.</a> </p>



<p>The result is <a href="https://oceanwomxn.co.za/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Ocean Womxn</strong></a>, a program funded for an 5 year initial period, that aims to remove barriers and provide support for Black womxn in oceanography. In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows receive comprehensive support – this includes financial cover for the duration of their degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They also have sea-going opportunities, such as SEAmester cruises, where they can develop lab skills and receive hands-on experience. Additionally, they are offered the option of swimming, boating and scuba lessons. </p>



<p>PLOS ONE recently spoke with some of the <a href="https://oceanwomxn.co.za/cohort-2020" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ocean Womxn Fellows</a> to learn more about the program and how it has impacted their journey as early career oceanographers. </p>

<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I would definitely say the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is definitely the exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.<em>  </em> </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong><em> </em>Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a “burden of service”, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a “burden of service”, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project Kuongoza Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now “serving” my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa: </strong>Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of “burden of service” I have the responsibility to “teach” science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large. </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and honour for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD! </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa’s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women! </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?  </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa: </strong>Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet. </p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE:</em></strong> More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science: to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research? </p>



<p><strong>Faith:</strong> I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the “openness” of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all. </p>



<p><strong>Kolisa:</strong> I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication? </p>

Valera, Fiona C. Neufeldt, Paul A. Kirkby, John E. Mitchell, and R. Angus Silver)</a></h4>

<blockquote><p>Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.</p></blockquote>

Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.</p>
<p>Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?</strong><br />
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.</p>
<p>Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.</p>
<p>In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>How can publishers advance public engagement?</strong><br />
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable <strong>“Patients perspectives”</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors <strong>to write a lay summary</strong> of their work (in one or more languages), <strong>a patient information note</strong>, and/or <strong>depict an infographic</strong> to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.</p>
<p>Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating <strong>the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist</strong>. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.</p>

<p><strong>The new normal</strong><br />
Innovations like creating and training<strong> a pool of engaged patient reviewers</strong> to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the <a href="https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/">Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/">Arthritis Foundation</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> the results of <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3">a systematic review</a> and <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0">a global survey</a> analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.</p>

<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/">Brian Simulator</a> is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/06/03/e-cigarettes-and-smoking-among-teenagers/">E-cigarettes and smoking among teenagers</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published <em>Tobacco Free Ireland</em>, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1">Our systematic review</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.</p>
<blockquote><p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes</p></blockquote>
<p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.</p>

<br /><p>Join us for a <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org">OCNS</a>) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021">here</a>.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.</p>
<p>The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.</p>
<p>To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/">https://labs.fedoraproject.org/</a> .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.</p>

<p>Last March, I shared <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/">my concerns</a> about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996">a paper </a>from the <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/">IHU-Méditerranée Infection</a> (IHUMI)/ <a href="https://www.univ-amu.fr/en">Aix-Marseille University</a> (AMU) claiming that Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin could reduce coronavirus viral loads faster than no treatment. </p>



<p>Other papers by this group of researchers led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand man Professor Eric Chabrière, also appear to contain problems, ranging from potentially duplicated images to ethical concerns. </p>



<p>In this blog post I have gathered the papers by the Raoult and Chabrière group that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a compilation of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors removing any concerns by providing the original figures.</p>

<h3>Concerns about duplicated images</h3>



<p>A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors have not replied to most of these PubPeer posts, nor have they corrected the errors.</p>



<h3>Category I duplications</h3>



<p>Some papers, such as DOI: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/">10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED">PubPeer</a>] or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/">10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A"> </a>[<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A">PubPeer</a>] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/">a previous post</a>, I call these <strong>Category I duplications</strong>, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. These kinds of simple duplications can often be honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum. Unfortunately, the authors have not replied to most of the PubPeer posts.</p>

<h3>Category II duplications</h3>



<p>Two papers in this set contain <strong>Category II duplications</strong>, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. </p>



<p>DOI <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/">10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1">PubPeer</a>] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which would be unexpected if the errors were unintentional. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction. The authors wrote: “<em>These resulted from errors by a researcher that were missed by other authors. Specifically, a single image was inappropriately inserted to represent three different experiments.</em>“</p>

<p>As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> docs or you browse <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill</a>, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.</p>

Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex">pycortex library</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?</p>



<p>A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Technology</th><th>Application areas</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th><th>What you learn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Python-based generators</td><td>Dashboards, lightweight interactions</td><td>Easy distribution, low barrier to entry</td><td>Limited interactivity</td><td>Grammar of interactive graphics</td></tr><tr><td>Jupyter notebook</td><td>Daily data exploration</td><td>You’re already using it!</td><td>Distribution not straightforward</td><td>Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG</td></tr><tr><td>Walled garden</td><td>All-in-one visualizations (widgets)</td><td>Limited things to learn</td><td>What you learn is non-transferable</td><td>The walled garden</td></tr><tr><td>JS notebooks</td><td>Literate programs</td><td>REPL environment, good docs</td><td>Learning curve a bit steep</td><td>Core JS plus visualization libraries</td></tr><tr><td>The web</td><td>Web dataviz</td><td>You control everything</td><td>Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep</td><td>Packaging, components, deployment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2>Step 0: Python-based libraries</h2>



<p>Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging pure Python-based libraries. Many libraries aim to fill a niche for everyday interactive graphics, which include minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc. This includes <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>, <a href="http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html">Bokeh w/Holoviews</a> and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html">Altair w/vegalite</a>. On the mapping side, <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet">ipyleaflet</a> is worth mentioning.</p>



<h3>Dashboard tools</h3>

<p>There has been an <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617">explosive growth in the past few years</a>. These solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations. </p>



<p>Here’s what to expect: a Python script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, such as sliders and combo boxes. The whole thing gets served via a server which caches requests intelligently – changes in sliders trigger remote fetches which refresh the visualization. Some custom visualizations may be written in JS. Oftentimes, dashboard solutions are associated with a specific plotting library. so all the docs will be written in terms of that library – but generally you have some flexibility to use other frameworks.</p>



<p>One clarification: if you want to share your visualizations, you’ll need a server. All solutions have a basic open source offering allowing you to DIY deploy such a server yourself via e.g. a cloud provider. If that sounds messy, you can instead opt for a managed cloud solution – there’s often a free tier and paid tiers with more capabilities availables. Here they are:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Product</th><th>Deployment</th><th>Peculiarities</th><th>Associated plotting library</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">Panel</a></td><td>DIY</td><td>Works inside of jupyter and standalone</td><td>Bokeh, with support other charting libraries</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a></td><td>DIY &amp; commercial</td><td>Very easy deploys</td><td>Agnostic</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">Dash</a></td><td>DIY &amp; commercial</td><td>Supports lots of customization, aimed at enterprise users</td><td>Plotly, with support for other libraries</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Of these, Streamlit seems to have the most momentum according to Github stars.</p>

<h2>Step 1: build for jupyter notebook</h2>



<p>Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser <em>right now</em>, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.</p>



<h3>_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="Image" height="126" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="417" />Basic demo of _repr_html_</figure></div>



<p>When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a <code>_repr_html_</code> method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing">See this colab for examples on how to do this</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669">You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method</a>, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. </p>



<p>You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output">using the ipython API</a>. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;'))
</pre></div>


<h3>ipywidgets and interact</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>ipywidgets</strong>, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb">interactive HTML widgets</a> for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.</p><cite><a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">The ipywidget manual</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Next in line in complexity are <code>ipywidgets</code>. Like <code>IPython.core.display</code>, <code>ipywidgets</code> can display rich HTML; however, <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html">widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python</a>. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5">See this notebook for an example</a>. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called <code>interact</code> which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.</p>



<h3>voila</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif" /><a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">Voila example, from their docs</a>.</figure>



<p>Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called <a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">voila</a>. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Walled gardens</h2>



<p>At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing <em>real javascript</em> in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.</p>



<h3>Unity</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-width="550"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A little Plinko sim<img alt="🎄" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f384.png" style="height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#unity3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/geKwfhlpj6">pic.twitter.com/geKwfhlpj6</a></p>— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1209900584473632770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">difficult to interact with the native DOM</a>. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.</p>



<h3>p5.js and openprocessing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><br /><br />OpenProcessing sketch, <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689">Self-organized critical model</a></figure>



<p><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://openprocessing.org/">openprocessing</a> bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Javascript notebooks</h2>



<p>The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. </p>



<p>For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.</p>



<h3>Observable</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7664" data-attachment-id="7664" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png" data-orig-size="603,602" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/" height="572" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" width="573" /></a>Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example">Code here</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  <a href="https://observablehq.com/tutorials">It has an excellent set of starter tutorials</a>. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript">it does not use Javascript</a>, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.</p>



<h3>Starboard</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7671" data-attachment-id="7671" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coupled-oscillators" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif" data-orig-size="380,380" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" /></a>An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. <a href="https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a">Source</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://starboard.gg/">Starboard</a> is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” </p><cite>Pyodide docs</cite></blockquote>



<p>That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary – though you’ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like <a href="https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite">jupyterlite</a> are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.</p>



<h2>Step 4: the web</h2>



<p>Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>, might satisfy your needs. </p>



<p>One very annoying gotcha you’ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you’ll use for data analysis in JS – like mathjs – were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you’ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack</a> and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));</code></pre>



<p>Thanks to Guido Zuidhof <a href="https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42">for patiently explaining this to me</a>.</p>



<p>Some templates exist to facilitate the creation of interactive blog posts or articles. Most notably, the <a href="https://github.com/distillpub/template">distill template</a> and <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">the Idyll language</a> facilitate the creation of explanatory articles (think those cool articles on the nytimes website which highlight different parts of graphs when you scroll down). Some of the best examples of this type of article can be seen on the <a href="https://visxai.io/">VISxAI website</a>.</p>



<p>For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">flask</a> deployed on <a href="https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku">heroku</a> would do the trick.</p>



<h2>JS libraries</h2>



<p>As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:</p>



<ul><li>d3: data driven documents in JS, <a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a></li><li>mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: <a href="https://mathjs.org/">https://mathjs.org/</a></li><li>stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib</a></li><li>Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/</a></li><li>Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">https://www.tensorflow.org/js</a></li><li>Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: <a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a></li><li>Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: <a href="https://github.com/uwdata/arquero">https://github.com/uwdata/arquero</a></li></ul>



<p>I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!</p>

<p>If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the <strong>Champion</strong> membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year">primarily for reading</a> or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, <strong>Community</strong> membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/arxiv-sustainability-model/">Announcing arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a></h4>

<p>In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/funding">arXiv’s updated sustainability model</a>. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors — and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.</p>
<p>For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise — and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:</p>
<p><b>Members </b></p>
<p>Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes</a> across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance. <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">Learn more about updates to the membership program here.</a></p>
<p><b>Affiliates</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits </a>collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become an affiliate or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sponsors</b></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/supporters">Companies</a> that benefit from arXiv’s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm">Become a sponsor or renew your support</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">submissions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads">downloads</a></li>
<li>seamless interoperability with other platforms</li>
<li>increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information</li>
<li>modernization of backend services and technological infrastructure for improved stability, performance and innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you already support arXiv, thank you! If not, we encourage you to consider how you or your organization can get involved. You’re invited to <a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org">contact us</a> to start the conversation.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper "Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.</p>

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7" target="_blank">Erik Hoel (2021)</a>:<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of <i>overfitting</i>,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[sic]</span></span> hypothesis.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  </p><p>In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”</p><blockquote><p>The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). <br /><b>. . .</b><br /></p><p>To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">artificial neural networks</a> for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015. The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html" target="_blank">DeepDream</a> program is a visualization tool that shows what the layers of the neural network have learned:</p><blockquote>One way to visualize what goes on is to turn the network upside down and ask it to enhance an input image in such a way as to elicit a particular interpretation. </blockquote><p><br />The image above is characteristic of the hallucinogenic output from the DeepDream web interface, and it illustrates that the original training set was filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724110554/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/50616707-deepdream-avoiding-kitsch" target="_blank">dogs, birds, and pagodas</a>.  DeepDream images inspired blog posts with titles like, <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep" target="_blank">Do neural nets dream of electric sheep?</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/07/google-deepdream-its-dazzling-creepy-and-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-future-of-a-i.html" target="_blank">Do Androids Dream of Electric Bananas?</a> and my favorite, <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/07/scary-brains-and-garden-of-earthly-deep.html">Scary Brains and the Garden of Earthly Deep Dreams</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Reference</b></p><p>Hoel E.
