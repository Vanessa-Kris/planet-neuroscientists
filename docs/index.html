              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">New delta variant studies show the pandemic is far from over</a></h4>

              
                <p>The coronavirus’s delta variant is different from earlier strains of the virus in worrying ways, health officials are discovering. And those differences may mean a return to some of the restrictions that vaccinated people thought were in the past.</p>



<p>The variant is not only more contagious than earlier strains, it also makes people sicker. And even vaccinated people can get infected and house similar levels of viral particles in their noses as unvaccinated people, raising concern about the vaccines’ ability to curb transmission, new data indicate. But experts caution that there&#8217;s more to infectiousness than just those viral levels in the nose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are five things to know about the new delta data:</p>



<h3>1. Vaccinated people can get infected with delta, but the vaccines are still working. </h3>





<p>Some 350 of about 470 people, nearly 75 percent, who caught the coronavirus in a large <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w">outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., were fully vaccinated</a>, researchers report July 30 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Public health officials linked many of those cases to packed indoor and outdoor events at places like bars and rental homes. The delta variant, which was first identified in India, was behind 120 of 133 analyzed COVID-19 cases, or 90 percent, in the outbreak. </p>



<p>But while it may sound like the vaccines didn’t do their job, the high proportion of cases in vaccinated people may be because of the county’s high vaccination rate, the researchers say; as of July 3, 70 percent of those eligible in Barnstable County are vaccinated. As more people in a community get vaccinated, the likelihood that someone who tests positive for the coronavirus has protection from the shots also goes up. That’s simply because the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Crucially, COVID-19 shots still protected vaccinated people from severe disease. While five people were hospitalized, including one unvaccinated person, as of July 27, no one had died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35,000 of the 162 million vaccinated people in the United States will develop a symptomatic infection every week. That’s about 21 COVID-19 cases in every 100,000 fully vaccinated people getting sick each week. That compares with about 179 infections among every 100,000 unvaccinated people per week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for hospitalization, two to three unvaccinated people out of every 100,000 will be hospitalized weekly with COVID-19 and roughly one person per 100,000 will die each week, according to CDC’s calculations. That’s about 25 times the number of fully vaccinated people facing the same fate. Among the fully vaccinated, 0.1 of 100,000 people will be hospitalized weekly and 0.04 per 100,000 will die each week.</p>



<h3>2. Vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta to others, but there’s a huge caveat to that.</h3>



<p>In that Massachusetts study, both unvaccinated and vaccinated people infected with the delta variant had similar levels of coronavirus genetic material in their noses, as measured by PCR, suggesting similar viral loads.<em> </em>Those elevated viral loads could mean that vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta than other coronavirus variants, despite being protected from the worst of COVID-19 themselves.</p>



<p>That “concerning” finding underpinned the agency’s recommendation from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">earlier in the week</a> that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain instances, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a July 30 statement (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this finding comes with major caveats. The result “just gives you an indication of how much viral RNA is in the sample, it tells you nothing about infectiousness,” says Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. These data “are a cause for concern, but this is not a definitive answer on transmissibility” from vaccinated people, she says.</p>



<p>When a vaccinated person gets infected and becomes symptomatic, “we already knew that they’d have higher viral loads,” Butler-Wu says. But the immune response jump-started by the vaccine may hamstring many of those viral particles. </p>





<p>“Many of these viral particles are likely coated in antibodies,” says Brett Lindenbach, a virologist at Yale University, meaning the viral particles “should be less infectious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The delta variant may spread more easily from vaccinated people than earlier variants, he says, but definitively demonstrating that would require detailed studies that document transmission events from vaccinated people to others. Still, both Lindenbach and Butler-Wu say that mask wearing, for vaccinated and unvaccinated people, can help slow the spread of the delta variant.</p>



<h3>3. The delta variant can actually make people sicker. </h3>



<p>Three recent studies in Canada, Singapore and Scotland indicate that the variant raises the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto analyzed data from the province of Ontario to see if different coronavirus variants made people sicker. She and colleague David Fishman had information about who got infected and what the outcome of the infection was. Even after accounting for vaccination, age and underlying health conditions, the delta variant carried a 120 percent increased risk of hospitalization, 287 percent increased risk of ICU admission and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2">137 percent increased risk of death</a>, the researchers report July 12 at medRxiv.org. “And that’s on top of what we see with alpha,” Tuite says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Singapore, a preliminary study in the <em>Lancet</em> posted June 7 to the preprint server SSRN found that the<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3861566"> delta variant nearly doubles the risk of pneumonia</a> compared with earlier strains and carries an increased risk of needing supplemental oxygen, being admitted to the ICU and dying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those preliminary data haven’t been reviewed by other scientists yet, but agree with data published in the <em>Lancet </em>June 14 from a study in Scotland. There, researchers found that the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext">delta variant doubles the risk of hospitalization</a> compared with the alpha variant.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the vaccines work slightly less well against the delta variant than they did against earlier strains. Still, vaccination reduces the risk of these serious complications. Vaccines are like using an extinguisher on a kitchen fire, says Paul Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The goal is to keep the rest of the house from burning down.” The virus can enter cells in the nose, throat and lungs and start to replicate there, “so you can have an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease,” Offit says.</p>



<p>But then, a vaccinated person’s immune system will kick in after a couple of days and prevent the infection from causing more severe disease, he says. “It’s easier to prevent moderate to severe disease than it is to prevent mild disease.”</p>



<h3>4. Delta is much more transmissible than previous forms of the coronavirus.</h3>



<p>An unvaccinated person infected with the ancestral version of the virus that first emerged at the end of 2019 typically transmitted the virus to two to four people on average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone infected with the delta variant, however, might pass the virus on to five to 10 others on average. That’s nearly on par with the contagiousness of chicken pox, <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/8a726408-07bd-46bd-a945-3af0ae2f3c37/note/57c98604-3b54-44f0-8b44-b148d8f75165.#page=1">internal CDC documents</a> first obtained and published by the <em>Washington Post</em> show.</p>



<h3>5. Public health measures like vaccination and masks remain crucial tools. </h3>



<p>The CDC recommended a return to masking, because it is one of the most effective tools to prevent infection.</p>



<p>N95 masks are effective in all settings, but surgical masks fare best when the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1439">concentration of viruses in the air is low</a>, an international group of researchers calculated in a June 25 <em>Science </em>study. And their calculations suggest the masks work best against both getting an infection and spreading it when everyone is wearing a mask. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks protect better</a> than ones that have gaps at the top or sides, previous studies have demonstrated (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three-layer <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e1.htm">cotton cloth masks are also effective</a>, researchers reported July 2 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Researchers tested how many stand-ins for virus-carrying aerosol particles mannequin heads “breathed” with and without cotton masks. If all the dummies wore masks, the combined concentration of aerosol particles in the air was 72 percent lower than the number of airborne particles when none of the mannequins were masked.</p>



<p>Combining masks with proper <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">ventilation and filtration may be even more helpful</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). In the mannequin study, researchers also placed two HEPA filters in various locations around the room. HEPA filtration cut exposure to airborne particles by 65 percent compared with no filtration and no masks. When all the mannequins were masked and the HEPA filters were on, the average particle concentration was reduced 90 percent.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Olympic athletes have always been under intense pressure, but this year the pandemic has added to the challenges they face.</strong> At <em>Wired, </em><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/simone-biles-tokyo-olympics">Amit Katwala explores</a> the impact that competing at the Olympics has on athletes’ mental health.</p>

<p><strong>People who were allowed to travel further unsupervised when they were kids are more confident navigators as adults.</strong> That’s according to work by psychologist Vanessa Vieites, <a href="https://theconversation.com/kids-set-free-to-roam-on-their-own-feel-more-confident-navigating-in-adulthood-163972">who describes her study</a> at <em>The Conversation.</em> Men also reported being allowed to explore more as children, which went some way to explaining gender differences in adult wayfinding.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Instagram is rife with memes about mental health. But are these actually beneficial to people who have experienced trauma? </strong>At <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/29/mental-health-memes-can-they-offer-more-than-comic-relief">Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett takes a nuanced look</a> at the possible benefits and dangers of this trend.  </p>

<p><strong>Cockatoos in Sydney know how to raid household bins <strong>—</strong> and, intriguingly, this is a behaviour that they seem to have learned from each other. </strong>Researchers found that before 2018, cockatoos in just a few suburbs were able to “dumpster dive”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/australia-s-cockatoos-are-masters-dumpster-diving-and-now-they-re-learning-each-other">reports Cathleen O’Grady</a> at <em>Science, </em>but over time the behaviour spread out from those original locations. The team even found that there are local “subcultures” of cockatoos that have different strategies for opening the bins.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Giving a stranger a compliment is not nearly as awkward as we anticipate, and also makes them feel much happier than we expect. </strong>At <em>BBC Worklife</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210722-why-we-dont-dole-out-many-compliments-but-should">David Robson looks at the research</a> on compliments, and concludes that we should be giving each other more of them (within reason!).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Both antidepressants and psychological therapy produce changes in the brain’s response to emotional information — though a recent study found that these changes occur in different but related areas. </strong>At <em>Psyche</em>, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/mental-disorders-are-brain-disorders-heres-why-that-matters">researcher Camilla Nord explains the results</a>, arguing that neuroscience has a central role to play in improving our understanding of mental health disorders and in the development of personalised treatments.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Finally, yet more research has looked at whether bronze or silver medallists are happier. </strong>This time, researchers used software to analyse the faces of athletes on the podium in the last five Olympic Games.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peru-skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim">A skeleton from Peru vies for the title of oldest known shark attack victim</a></h4>

              
                <p>When news broke that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">oldest known case of a person killed by a shark</a> involved a member of Japan’s Jōmon culture around 3,000 years ago, two researchers took special notice (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>Back in 1976, bioarchaeologist Robert Benfer of the University of Missouri in Columbia and Harvard University anthropological archaeologist Jeffrey Quilter had participated in an excavation of a roughly 17-year-old boy’s skeleton that bore signs of a fatal shark encounter. The boy’s left leg was missing and his right hip and right forearm bones displayed deep bite marks characteristic of those made by sharks, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“Successful shark bites usually involve tearing off a limb, often a leg, and ingesting it,” Benfer says. An unsuccessful attempt to ward off a shark presumably resulted in the boy’s arm injuries.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating indicated that the teen, whose remains were discovered at a Peruvian village site called Paloma, died around 6,000 years ago before being placed in a grave unlike any others in his community, says Benfer, who directed investigations at Paloma in 1976 and in three more field seasons that concluded in 1990. That could make the teen the oldest known shark attack victim.</p>





<p>Quilter went on to describe the youth’s shark-related injuries in two paragraphs in a 1989 book, <a href="https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781587293993/life-and-death-at-paloma"><em>Life and Death at Paloma</em></a>. But the results were never published in an academic journal. Quilter and Benfer e-mailed the excerpt to the Jōmon researchers on July 26. “We were unaware of their claim until now, but are keen to speak to them about it in more detail,” says University of Oxford archaeologist J. Alyssa White, who led the Jōmon team.</p>



<p>Paloma lies in hills about 3.5 kilometers from Peru’s Pacific coast. Small groups intermittently lived there in round, reed huts between around 7,800 and 4,000 years ago. Paloma’s residents primarily fished, collected or dove for shellfish, and gathered edible plants.</p>



<p>A majority of the 201 human graves excavated at Paloma were dug beneath or just outside reed huts. But the young man with a missing leg was buried in a long, oval pit dug in an open area and left unfilled. Excavators found remains of a grid of canes that had been tied together and covered with several woven mats to form a cover or roof over the body. Items placed in the grave included a seashell, a large, flat rock and several ropes, one with elaborate knots and a tassel at one end.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/utdtRG6AyfE/">Impact AND credibility matter when researchers evaluate research</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>by Veronique Kiermer, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, &amp; James Harney.</strong></p>



<p>Today we&rsquo;ve posted a <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ryds4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, along with accompanying data, on qualitative research we conducted about how researchers assess the credibility and impact of research. This study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was supported by a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> and conducted with the assistance of the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Cell Biology</a>. The findings will inform future PLOS activities to support improved research assessment practices &mdash; specifically to support efforts to move emphasis towards individual research outputs and away from journal-level metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/how-do-researchers-evaluate-research/">wrote </a>in October 2020, we are interested in how researchers evaluate research outputs when (1) conducting their own research, and (2) when they take part in committees for hiring or grant review. In particular, we were interested in how researchers make judgments about the <em>credibility</em> and<em> impact </em>of the research outputs &mdash; including papers, preprints, research data &mdash; that they encounter in these contexts.</p>



<p>We interviewed 52 cell biology researchers.&nbsp; Our approach focused on the goals they are trying to achieve (e.g.&rdquo;identify impactful research to read&rdquo;), rather than the tools they are presently using to carry out these tasks. By focusing on researchers&rsquo; goals (the <em>what</em>) rather than <em>how</em> they are achieving them, we sought to better understand how we might influence those practices. This qualitative research will be followed by survey work to better quantify our findings. This will provide insights into opportunities for better solutions for improved research assessment. In particular, we&rsquo;ll understand what signals of credibility and impact might provide researchers with more useful ways than journal impact factor or journal prestige to assess the quality and credibility of individual studies and individual researchers.</p>



<p>Our results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the <em>credibility</em> (or trustworthiness) of research outputs is the central concern for researchers when conducting their own research, and that <em>impact</em> was a strong focus when researchers are part of hiring or grant review committees. But we established that researchers also assess attributes of research outputs related to reproducibility, quality, and novelty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we found that researchers said they assessed credibility in committees more frequently than we anticipated, given that impact considerations &mdash; including journal impact factor &mdash; are prevalent in committee guidance and research assessment objectives (see for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McKiernan et al</a>. (2019), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niles et al.</a> (2020), <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:32909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alperin et al.</a> (2020), and <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-research-9780190640125?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugimoto &amp; Larivi&egrave;re</a> (2018)).</p>



<p>Our interviews confirmed that convenient proxies for credibility and impact, usually those based on journals, are used pervasively and are common in both research discovery and committee activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research also indicates that when researchers inspect publications to evaluate credibility they try to minimize the amount of time they spend reading and understanding publications. Their tactics included selective reading of the abstracts, figures, and methods sections. Sometimes they said that they also look for signals such as whether data was available and had been reused, whether peer-reviewed versions of preprints have been published, and whether open peer review reports were available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insights that help us better understand what researchers&rsquo; goals are and how they make judgements about credibility when discovering and reading research may offer opportunities to provide more reliable signals that help them with these tasks, yet are better tailored for credibility judgments than journal-level metrics. The stated importance of assessing credibility by researchers who participate in research assessment committees also suggests an opportunity for funders and institutions to better align their guidelines with the practice and motivations of committee members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our follow-up survey work to validate these preliminary findings, we will report back and hope that this research will help others in the understanding and development of better methods of research assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-wasp-larvae-caterpillars">Viruses can kill wasp larvae that grow inside infected caterpillars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When parasitic wasps come calling, some caterpillars have a surprising ally: a viral infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insects called parasitoid wasps lay their eggs inside young moth larvae, turning the caterpillars into unwitting, destined-to-die incubators for possibly hundreds of wasp offspring. That’s bad news for viruses trying to use the caterpillars as replication factories. For the caterpillars, viral infections can be lethal, but their chances of survival are probably higher than if wasps choose them as a living nursery.</p>



<p>Now, a study shows how certain viruses can help caterpillars stymie parasitoid wasps. A group of proteins dubbed parasitoid killing factor, or PKF, that are found in some insect viruses <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6396">are incredibly toxic to young parasitoid wasps,</a> researchers report in the July 30 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The new finding shows that viruses and caterpillars can come together to fight off a common wasp enemy, says study coauthor Madoka Nakai, an insect virologist at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. A parasitoid wasp would kill a host that the virus needs to survive, so the virus fights for its home. “It’s very clever,” Nakai says.</p>





<p>What’s more, some moth caterpillars make the wasp-killing proteins themselves, the team found. It’s possible that in the distant past, a few moths survived a viral infection and “got some presents” in the form of genetic instructions for how to make the proteins, says study coauthor Salvador Herrero, an insect pathologist and geneticist at the University of Valencia in Spain. Those insects could have then passed the ability down to offspring. In this case, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” Herrero says.</p>



<p>Previous studies had shown that viruses and insects, including moths, can swap genes with each other. The new finding is one of the latest examples of this activity, says Michael Strand, an entomologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“Parasite-host relationships are very specialized,” he says. “Factors like [PKF] are probably important in defining which hosts can be used by which parasites.” But whether caterpillars stole the genetic instructions for the proteins from viruses or if viruses originally stole the instructions from another host remains unclear, Strand says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered in the 1970s that virus-infected caterpillars could <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/168/3928/251">kill parasitoid wasp larvae using an unknown viral protein</a>. In the new study, Herrero and colleagues identified PKF as wasp-killing proteins. The team infected moth caterpillars with one of three insect viruses that carry the genetic blueprints to make the proteins. Then the researchers either allowed wasps to lay their eggs in the caterpillars or exposed wasp larvae to hemolymph — the insect equivalent of blood — from infected caterpillars.  </p>



<p>Virus-infected caterpillars were poor hosts of the parasitoid wasp <em>Cotesia kariyai</em>; most young wasps died before they had the chance to emerge from the caterpillars into the world. Hemolymph from infected caterpillars was also an efficient killer of wasp larvae, typically destroying more than 90 percent of offspring.</p>



<p><em>C.</em> <em>kariyai</em> wasp larvae also didn’t survive in caterpillars, including the beet armyworm (<em>Spodoptera exigua</em>), that make their own PKF. When the researchers blocked the genes for the proteins in these caterpillars, the wasps lived, a sign that the proteins are key for the caterpillars’ defenses.</p>



<p>Some parasitoid wasps, including <em>Meteorus pulchricornis</em>, weren’t affected by PKF from the viruses and also beet armyworms, allowing the wasp offspring to thrive inside caterpillars. That finding suggests that the wasp-fighting ability is species-specific, says Elisabeth Herniou, an insect virologist at CNRS and the University of Tours in France who was not involved in the work. Pinpointing why some wasps aren’t susceptible could reveal the details of a long-held evolutionary battle between all three types of organisms.  </p>



<p>The study highlights that “single genes can interfere with the outcome of [these] interactions,” Herniou says. “One virus may have this gene and the other virus doesn’t have it,” and that can change what happens when virus, caterpillar and parasitoid all collide.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-chicxulub-earth-largest-ripple-marks-tsunami">Dinosaur-killing asteroid may have made Earth’s largest ripple marks</a></h4>

              
                <p>The asteroid impact that slew the dinosaurs may have also indirectly sculpted the largest ripple marks ever found on Earth.</p>



<p>A series of ridgelike structures more than three stories high and spaced nearly two Eiffel Towers apart appear to be buried about 1,500 meters beneath central Louisiana. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X21003186?via%3Dihub">The oversized features are megaripples shaped by a massive tsunami</a> generated by the Chicxulub asteroid impact, researchers report in the Sept. 15 <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s just interesting that something that happened 66 million years ago could be so well preserved, buried 5,000 feet down in the sediments of Louisiana,” says geologist Gary Kinsland of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.</p>



<p>Ripple marks are repeating sequences of ridges typically found on sandy beaches or stream bottoms that form as wind or water flows over and moves loose sediment. But ripple marks on the beach are often centimeters in height, while the structures found by Kinsland’s team have an average height of 16 meters and are spaced about 600 meters apart.</p>





<p>The marks’ shape, size, orientation and location suggest that they formed after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dino-dooming-asteroid-impact-created-chilling-sulfur-cloud">the Chicxulub asteroid</a> crashed into what is today’s Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, generating a tsunami that washed across the sediments of the Gulf of Mexico and over what is now Louisiana, which was underwater at the time (<em>SN: 11/2/17</em>). Despite the tsunami’s width, no one has ever found ripple marks formed by the wave before.</p>



<p>Geologist Kaare Egedahl initially discovered the newly described ripples while searching for coal deposits. Studying at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette at the time, Egedahl had been combing through seismic reflection data – 3-D images of buried rock and soil generated by underground sound waves — provided by the Devon Energy company. Egedahl, now at the oil and gas company Cantium, found the ripples atop a layer of rock thought to have formed from debris shaken up by the Chicxulub asteroid impact. He then shared his finding with Kinsland.</p>

</em></span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102033">Martell Strong</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I knew where that layer was from in geologic time, and I knew what happened there,” Kinsland says. “I knew there should be a tsunami.”</p>



<p>The supposed ripple marks were preserved all this time thanks to the depth at which they formed underwater, Kinsland says. Other studies suggest that the region of present-day Louisiana in which the ripples took shape was 60 meters below the sea surface at the time. At that depth, the ripples would have been beyond the reach of tumultuous storm activity that could have erased them. Then, over millions of years, the marks were slowly buried by other sediments.</p>



<p>A smaller, analogous set of structures may exist off the east coast of Japan. There, a repeating sequence of underwater dunes was reported to have appeared after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Those dunes look nearly identical to the ripple marks buried beneath Louisiana, except for their size, Kinsland says, supporting the notion that the taller structures were also produced by a tsunami, though one of a much larger magnitude.</p>



<p>Still, there is contention over whether the features beneath Louisiana really are megaripples formed by the Chicxulub tsunami.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to see how such a high-energy event could form ripple marks because they are usually associated with much calmer environments,” says sedimentologist Pedro J.M. Costa of the Universidade de Coimbra in Portugal. And ripple marks typically form from frequent and recurring wave motion, while tsunamis don’t have many waves, he explains. Costa, who is an expert on tsunami deposits, says that reconstructing the lay of the seafloor at that time of the impact and conducting experiments could help unravel the origins of the structures found by Kinsland’s team.</p>



<p>This new work is important because it opens a discussion, Costa says. “Maybe [the Chicxulub impact was] such a high-magnitude event that what we see in normal tsunami events don’t apply to this one.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bears-bludgeon-walrus-stones-tools-ice-inuit">Polar bears sometimes bludgeon walruses to death with stones or ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Walruses, weighing as much as 1,300 kilograms with huge tusks and nearly impenetrable skulls, are almost impossible for a hungry polar bear to kill. But new research suggests that some polar bears have invented a work-around — bashing walruses on the head with a block of stone or ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>For more than 200 years, Inuit in Greenland and the eastern Canadian Arctic have told stories of polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) using such tools to aid in killing walruses. Yet explorers, naturalists and writers often dismissed such accounts, relegating them to myth along with tales about shape-shifting bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The persistence of these reports, including one report from an Inuk hunter in the late 1990s, coupled with photos of a male polar bear named GoGo at a Japanese zoo using tools to obtain suspended meat compelled Ian Stirling and colleagues to investigate further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been my general observation that if an experienced Inuit hunter tells you that he’s seen something, it’s worth listening to and very likely to be correct,” says Stirling, one of the world’s leading polar bear biologists.</p>





<p>The researchers reviewed historical, secondhand observations of tool use in polar bears reported by Inuit hunters to explorers and naturalists as well as recent observations by Inuit hunters and non-Inuit researchers and documented observations of GoGo and brown bears — polar bears’ closest relatives — using tools in captivity to access food. This review suggests&nbsp;that <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/arctic/article/view/72532">tool use in wild polar bears, though infrequent, does occur in the case of hunting walruses</a> because of their large size, the researchers report in the June <em>Arctic</em>.</p>



<p>“Really, the only species you would want to bonk on the head with a piece of ice would be a walrus,” says Andrew Derocher, director of the Polar Bear Science Lab at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who wasn’t involved with the new study. He suspects that it might just be a few polar bears that do this behavior. For example, if a mother bear figured out how to use ice or stone in this way, “it’s something her offspring would pick up on,” but not necessarily a skill polar bears across the Arctic would acquire, he says.</p>



<p>Among animals, using tools to solve problems has long been regarded as a marker of a higher level of what humans consider intelligence. Notoriously smart chimpanzees, for example, <a href="http://sciencenews.org/article/tools-prey-female-chimps-move-fore-hunting">craft spears</a> to hunt smaller mammals (<em>SN: 2/28/07</em>). Dolphins carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-moms-dolphins-learn-tool-use-their-mothers">marine sponges</a> in their mouths to stir sand and uncover prey (<em>SN: 6/8/05</em>). And elephants have been known to drop logs or large rocks onto electric fences to cut off the power supply.</p>



<p>Studies on the cognitive abilities of polar bears are lacking. “We don’t know anything experimental or objective at all,” Stirling says. “However, we have a great deal of observational information that tends to suggest polar bears are really smart.”</p>



<p>Members of the bear family, Ursidae, are typically assumed to have strong cognitive skills as a result of their large brains and evidenced by their sophisticated hunting strategies. Studies on captive American black bears have even revealed some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398692/">mental capabilities that appear to exceed those of primates</a>.</p>

<p>Gabriel Nirlungayuk, an Inuk hunter of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, Canada, says he has heard such stories of polar bears using tools to hunt walruses. “I’ve seen polar bears since I was probably 7 years old. I’ve been around them, I’ve hunted alongside them, and I have seen their behaviors. The smartest hunters are usually the female bears.” Sometimes, he says, polar bears will trick young seals to come closer by pretending to be asleep in open water. Other times he’s observed that a polar bear can sniff out a seal’s breathing hole in ice, even if it’s obscured by snow.</p>



<p>“I have worked with the Inuit on traditional knowledge for a very long time and one of my favorite subjects is polar bears, because science often suggests one thing and the Inuit say another thing,” he notes.</p>



<p>There are around 26,000 wild polar bears living in 19 subpopulations across the Arctic and sub-Arctic. The bears primarily eat seals, hunting the marine mammals by staking out above their breathing holes. Because of climate change, Arctic sea ice is fast disappearing, and scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0818-9">predict</a> that many polar bear populations will be extinct by the century’s end. Desperate polar bears may increasingly attack walruses, but “there are limitations to how many walruses an adult bear can take down,” says coauthor Kristin Laidre, an Arctic ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. It takes a lot of energy.</p>



<p>Following publication of the new study, Stirling received a video from U.S. Geological Survey scientist Anthony Pagano, based in Anchorage, Alaska, who had previously attached a GoPro camera to a wild polar bear for a separate project. That footage, Stirling says, shows a <a href="https://youtu.be/qXQBjZLNYT0?t=779">female polar bear sliding a large block of ice</a> around before throwing it into the water at a seal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-fossils-tubes-890-million-year-old-rock-ancient-sea-sponge">If confirmed, tubes in 890-million-year-old rock may be the oldest animal fossils</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pale, wormlike tubes in 890-million-year old rock may be ancient sea sponges, a new study concludes. If confirmed, that controversial claim would push back the origin of the earliest sponges by about 350 million years and make the tiny squiggles the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03773-z">oldest known fossils of animals</a>, by far.</p>



<p>Crucially, these fossils would imply that animals emerged in environmental conditions previously thought unworkable for animal life, geologist Elizabeth Turner reports July 28 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Early in Earth’s history, the ocean mostly lacked oxygen. It wasn’t until a large pulse of the gas to the atmosphere about 800 million to 540 million years ago, known as the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event, brought atmospheric oxygen levels to within 10 to 50 percent of modern levels, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-might-not-have-needed-major-event-become-oxygen-rich">boosting the amount of oxygen in surface ocean waters</a> (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). “But sponges are different from other animals,” says Turner, of Laurentian University in Sudbury, Canada. “Some sponges in the modern world and in the rock record are known to be tolerant of comparatively low oxygen relative to modern ocean levels.”</p>



<p>Until now, the earliest, unambiguous fossils of sponges date to about 540 million years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, when an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-boost-aided-carnivore-evolution-cambrian-explosion">extreme burst</a> in the evolution of animal diversity took place (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/29/13</em>). Some other animals are known from just a bit earlier, but go <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/possible-ancestor-sponges-found">too much further back in time</a> and identities become less clear (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/9/15</em>).&nbsp;Based on genetic data and their relative simplicity, sponges are generally thought to have been the earliest form of animal life.</p>







<p>But some scientists aren’t convinced that the newly described tubes are sponge fossils. “Organisms from anywhere on the tree of life can make wiggly, little [branching and rejoining] structures,” says Jonathan Antcliffe, a paleobiologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. The fossils lack features such as mineralized skeletal parts called spicules that would identify the creatures as sponges, he says.</p>



<p>What’s more, the finding “doesn&#8217;t fit with everything we know about the whole [ocean] ecosystem” in regards to nutrient, biomineral and oxygen availability before the Cambrian Period, Antcliffe says. “Everything we know about the Earth&#8217;s oceans in this interval of time tells us that animals originated around 540 [to] 550 million years ago. It’s a legion of evidence, and to overturn such an enormously strong paradigm, you need more than ‘might be a sponge.’”</p>



<p>Turner first found the network of tubes in 1992 in rocks from the ancient Little Dal cyanobacteria reef in Canada’s Mackenzie Mountains. “I found this thing that was totally out of place,” she says. “It was much more complex in terms of its structure than anything that could be made by cyanobacteria.”</p>

<p>She would have reported the curious squiggles then, but without much else to tie them to sponges besides a general resemblance, Turner moved on. But after <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/jsedres/article-abstract/77/7/552/145145/Degradative-Calcification-of-a-Modern-Siliceous?redirectedFrom=fulltext">more recent research</a> showed that sponges could be preserved in rock similarly to the Little Dal’s pallid wiggles, she returned to her find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turner argues that many modern sponges don’t have spicules and that the newly described fossils may be similar. And she suggests that sponges predating the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event may have scraped out an existence in “oxygen oases” along microbial reefs, living in holes and reef flanks and not competing with cyanobacteria for space.</p>



<p>It’s possible that early sponges emerged much earlier than the rest of animal life and remained in a kind of “evolutionary stasis” in low-oxygen conditions, she says, with the evolution of later, more complex animals having to wait until the gas became more abundant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have known about odd types of fossils in the Little Dal reef for a while, says James Schiffbauer, a paleobiologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia who wasn’t involved in the research.&nbsp;And “we’ve expected from molecular clocks that sponges should be present earlier in the Neoproterozoic [Era],” he adds, referring to genetic analyses that estimate that sponges evolved well before the Cambrian Period. “It has just been a matter of finding them if they were indeed preserved.”</p>



<p>Future research could help confirm the fossils’ identity. Turner plans to work more with the ancient tubes, adding that more answers may come from looking in the right places. “We need to be looking for similar material with a really open mind in rocks of similar age, and we need to be looking for more complex animal evidence in them as well,” rather than just simpler organisms like microbes.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>What makes something go viral online? A lot of work has highlighted the role of emotion: social media posts that express strong emotions — and particularly negative emotions — tend to spread further.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/26/e2024292118.short?rss=1&amp;__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_bd883c6c8345c6cc6aa44fcf30a1e828c6a1fe6a-1627479224-0-gqNtZGzNAfijcnBszQii">a study</a> in <em>PNAS </em>has identified another factor which seems to have an even greater effect on how often posts are shared. Steve Rathje from the University of Cambridge and colleagues find that tweets and Facebook posts that contain more language referring to political opponents get more shares. These posts may be so popular, the team finds, because they appeal to feelings of anger and outrage towards the political out-group.</p>



<span id="more-43045"></span>



<p>The first study looked at hundreds of thousands of tweets and Facebook posts made in the last few years by media outlets with either a liberal (e.g. <em>The New York Times</em>) or conservative (e.g. <em>Fox News</em>) outlook. The team were interested in how the language of the social media posts related to how often those posts were shared. Using existing dictionaries designed for text analysis research, they looked at how many negative and positive emotion words (e.g. “hate” or “happy”) each post contained, as well has how many “moral-emotional” words it had (these are words that are contained in both dictionaries of moral and emotional words, like “destroy”, “peace”, or “victim”).</p>



<p>The researchers also compared the text against “Republican” and “Democrat” dictionaries. These contained the names of politicians and political terms related to either party — so “Donald Trump” and “right-wing” were in the Republican dictionary, for example, while “Pete Buttigieg” and “leftist” were in the Democrat one.</p>



<p>The team found that posts were shared more often when they contained more negative emotion words: every additional negative emotion word was associated with a 5-8% increase in the number of times a post was shared (with the exception of Facebook posts by conservative media). Similarly, each additional positive word <em>decreased</em> the number of shares by 2-11%. Moral-emotional words had an even stronger effect, increasing the number of shares by 10-17%.</p>



<p>These findings are broadly consistent with past work finding that people tend to share negative and morally-laden posts online. However, the really interesting finding came from the analysis of political language. More “in-group” language (e.g. liberal media posts containing words from the Democrat dictionary) was generally related to more shares. But the biggest effect came from “out-group” language (e.g. liberal media posts containing words from the Republican dictionary): each additional out-group word boosted shares by a whopping 35-57%.</p>



<p>A second study took the same approach, but looked at posts by members of Congress instead. And the results were pretty much the same: negative and moral-emotion words were related to more shares, but this was eclipsed by the far bigger effect of out-group language. In this case, each additional out-group word increased shares by 65-180%. Looking at the results across both studies, the team conclude that, overall, each political out-group word increased shares by around 67% — several times larger than the effect of negative or moral-emotional words.</p>



<p>Posts about the political outgroup are presumably usually quite hostile, and this could be what drives engagement. The team found some indirect evidence that this was the case, by examining how the audience used Facebook’s reaction emojis. They found that posts with more political out-group language provoked more “angry” and “haha” reactions, suggesting that these posts tended to be designed to provoke anger or mockery. More in-group language, on the other hand, predicted more “love” reactions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, then, the results suggest that people tend to share social media posts which allow them to express their social or political identity — particularly those which disparage political opponents. This has implications for understanding why social media — and the political landscape more widely — has become so polarised, the authors write. For instance, we’re often concerned about social media becoming an “echo chamber”, where people only hear from others who they agree with. The study suggests the problem isn’t simply that people only hear from their in-group, but that the posts they are most likely to see may actively promote animosity towards the out-group.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, things may not change any time soon. There are benefits to going viral: politicians or media outlets might gain followers, while social media companies rely on audience engagement for revenue. So this kind of polarising content is actually being incentivised by the very structure of the social media platforms, the team writes. “Content expressing out-group animosity may be good at generating superficial engagement while ultimately harming individuals, political parties, or society in the long-term,” they conclude.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/26/e2024292118.short?rss=1&amp;__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_bd883c6c8345c6cc6aa44fcf30a1e828c6a1fe6a-1627479224-0-gqNtZGzNAfijcnBszQii">Out-group animosity drives engagement on social media</a></p>

                <p>Next time you’re looking at a rainbow, be thankful you’re not a tardigrade. While the microscopic creatures, also known as water bears, are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-bears-will-survive-end-world-we-know-it">master survivors</a> when it comes to radiation, space or extreme temperatures (<em>SN: 7/14/17</em>), they may lack one way to appreciate the world they live in: the ability to see in color.</p>



<p>Tardigrades’ close arthropod relatives can see color and ultraviolet light. But tardigrades don’t have the same light-sensing proteins, called opsins, that arthropods do. That means they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evab164/6320065">might not be able to see either visible or UV light</a>, researchers report July 13 in <em>Genome Biology and Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>While working at Keio University Institute of Advanced Biosciences in Yamagata, Japan, evolutionary biologist James Fleming and colleagues cataloged which opsins tardigrades have. Then the team used genetic analysis to figure out whether these opsins were active or not in two species: <em>Hypsibius exemplaris </em>and <em>Ramazzottius variornatus</em>.</p>



<p>Despite having active opsins, <em>R. variornatus</em> doesn’t have eyes — a problem for seeing things. Still, “it’s doing something with [the opsins],” says Fleming, now at the University of Oslo Natural History Museum. What exactly that is remains unknown.</p>





<p><em>H. exemplaris </em>have eyes but don’t have opsins that can respond to multiple types of light, the team found — a crucial trait to detect different colors. And tardigrade eyes are fairly simple, Fleming says. Even with additional opsins, they can&#8217;t make out images. In a more complex eye, those additional opsins might create vision that resembles a black and white silent film instead of a murky 1800s photo, he says.</p>



<p>Many of the opsin genes also were more active when the critters were eggs than when they were adults. “Understandably, there is not a lot of ecological use for being able to see whilst you’re inside of an egg,” Fleming says. But there might be other light-sensitive processes important for the egg’s development. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings don’t entirely rule out whether tardigrades might see color. “Color vision in general is a very messy topic,” Fleming says. Directly testing water bears’ eyes would help researchers know for sure.</p>

Now, arXiv is partnering with a wide range of organizations across the scientific community, including the US National Laboratories, on a transgender-inclusive name-change process for academic work. This agreement will allow researchers who wish to change their names to more easily claim work from all stages of their careers; it specifically addresses the administrative and emotional difficulties some transgender researchers have experienced when requesting name changes associated with past academic work. For researchers of all genders, and transgender researchers specifically, the new process ensures they can rightfully claim ownership of prior work without fear of reprisal under their lived name and be known in their respective fields primarily through their merits as authors. The partnership between the national laboratories, major scientific publishers, journals, and other organizations represents a commitment to creating a more inclusive culture in STEM fields and STEM publishing in particular.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-dot-exomoon-evidence-exoplanet-moon-stars-astronomy">The tiny dot in this image may be the first look at exomoons in the making</a></h4>

              
                <p>New telescope images may provide the first view of moons forming outside the solar system.</p>



<p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile glimpsed a dusty disk of potentially moon-forming material around a baby exoplanet about 370 light-years from Earth. The Jupiter-like world is surrounded by enough material <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac0f83">to make up to 2.5 Earth moons</a>, researchers report online July 22 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Observations of this system could offer new insight into how planets and moons are born around young stars.</p>



<p>ALMA observed two planets, dubbed PDS 70b and 70c, circling the star PDS 70 in July 2019. Unlike most other known exoplanets, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-snap-first-baby-pictures-planet">these two Jupiter-like worlds are still forming</a> — gobbling up material from the disk of gas and dust swirling around their star (<em>SN: 7/2/18</em>). During this formation process, planets are expected to wrap themselves in their own debris disks, which control how planets pack on material and form moons.</p>



<p>Around PDS 70c, ALMA spotted a disk of dust about as wide as Earth’s orbit around the sun. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler">previously reported exomoon sightings still controversial</a>, the new observations offer some of the best evidence yet that planets orbiting other stars have moons (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike PDS 70c, 70b does not appear to have a moon-forming disk. That may be because it has a narrower orbit than PDS 70c, which is nearly as far from its star as Pluto is from the sun. That puts PDS 70c closer to an outer disk of debris surrounding the star.</p>

<p>“C is getting all the material from the outer disk, and b is getting starved,” says study coauthor Jaehan Bae, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>“In the past, b must have gotten some material in its [disk], and it could have already formed moons,” Bae says. But to make the new images, ALMA observed wavelengths of light emitted by sand-sized dust grains, not large objects, so those moons would not be visible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">Why the CDC says it’s crucial to start wearing masks indoors again</a></h4>

              
                <p>Delta has changed the course of the pandemic in the United States yet again.</p>



<p>After spurring a summer surge in COVID-19 cases, the more transmissible coronavirus variant is now driving federal health officials’ decision to recommend that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks again in indoor public places. That’s especially important in areas where infection rates are high, Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference July 27 to announce revised masking guidelines.</p>



<p>New evidence that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections of the delta variant produce just as much virus as infected, unvaccinated people prompted the new guidance. That suggests that these people may also easily spread the virus. “We have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you’re fully vaccinated,” Walensky said.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>Unvaccinated people should get vaccinated and wear masks in public indoor settings until fully vaccinated, she recommended. Additionally, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">fully vaccinated people in places with “high or substantial” transmission rates should also mask up</a> when indoors again. The CDC considers substantial transmission to be 50 to 100 cases out of every 100,000 people in the population over a seven-day period. Some places are reporting more than 300 cases per 100,000 people in a week, she said. “Really an extraordinary amount of viral transmission.” And everyone in schools should wear a mask, regardless of vaccination status, the CDC recommends.</p>



<p>This reverses the CDC’s May recommendation that fully vaccinated people could ditch the masks. That decision was based, in part, on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-mask-guideline-question-answer-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">low chance that vaccinated people could spread the virus</a> (<em>SN: 5/24/21</em>). If they do get a breakthrough infection, people vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines have about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107058">40 percent less virus</a> in their noses than infected, unvaccinated people do, researchers reported July 22 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. But that data was based on infections with earlier variants of the virus.</p>



<p>“The delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that causes COVID-19,” Walensky said. It’s “unlike the alpha variant we had back in May where we didn’t believe that if you were vaccinated you could transmit further.” In rare instances, fully vaccinated people may get infected with the delta variant and spread it to others, new data from several states and other countries shows, she said. The amount of virus vaccinated people with a delta variant breakthrough infection produce is similar to that of unvaccinated people, she said. “This new science is worrisome,” she said.</p>

</aside>



<p>The vaccines are still effective at preventing serious illness and death, studies have shown. Until the vast majority of people are vaccinated, “mask wearing will help reduce infections, prevent serious illnesses and death, limit strain on local hospitals and stave off the development of even more troubling variants, Barbara Alexander, an infectious diseases expert at Duke University School of Medicine and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.</p>



<p>The majority of transmission is still happening among and through unvaccinated people, Walensky said. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakthrough infections remain rare</a>, but exactly how rare they are with the delta variant isn’t known (<em>SN: 5/4/21</em>). The CDC collects data on breakthrough infections in hospitalized people, but not those who get infected but have mild cases. The public health agency is also actively testing more than 20 groups of vaccinated people for COVID-19, including tens of thousands of health care workers, essential workers and other caregivers. Results of that surveillance will be reported soon, Walensky said.</p>



<p>“It is not a welcome piece of news that masking is going to be a part of people’s lives who have already been vaccinated,” Walensky said. “This new data weighs heavily on me. This new guidance weighs heavily on me…  This was not a decision that was taken lightly.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/QxczBI6_0fY/">Extending support for preprint sharing</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS&rsquo; Director of Open Research Solutions</p>



<p>All PLOS journals welcome submission of papers that have been shared as preprints. PLOS was amongst the first publishers to adopt this policy, as we recognise the value in early sharing of community-curated research, a value borne out in the COVID pandemic.</p>



<p>As well as our permissive policy on preprints, we support preprint posting by authors by partnering with preprint services that are relevant to and adopted by a journal&rsquo;s community. To this end, PLOS&rsquo; new journals, which opened for submissions in May 2021, now welcome submissions directly from bioRxiv and/or medRxiv, two of the most widely adopted preprint servers for biology and medicine, respectively.</p>



<p>Bidirectional links between PLOS journal articles and preprints at bioRxiv and medRxiv also help assure readers of the credibility (trustworthiness) of preprints that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. This integration between preprint servers and journals saves authors time in submitting papers to PLOS journals. Authors do not need to reload manuscript files and re-enter author information at the journal. Researchers also increase their potential for peer feedback to improve their work. Preprint sharing is, also, an open research practice that has been<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/2/618/96153/The-relationship-between-bioRxiv-preprints"> associated with more readership and citations of peer-reviewed papers</a>.</p>



<p>The preprint server-to-journal relationships for the new PLOS journals are:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Receives submissions directly from bioRxiv</strong></td><td><strong>Receives submissions directly from medRxiv</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Climate</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Digital Health*</em></td><td>n/a</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Global Public Health*</em></td><td>n/a</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr><tr><td><em>PLOS Water</em></td><td>&#9989;</td><td>&#9989;</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>*As a health research-focused journal, only medRxiv is applicable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As an early adopter of preprints, the proportion of published PLOS articles shared as a preprint is increasing year-on-year, with15% of articles published in PLOS journals so far in 2021 having an associated preprint. But adoption of preprints varies greatly by journal, discipline and region. More than 50% of research papers published in <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, for example, have associated preprints.</p>



<p>Support for sharing and receiving preprints is one of the numerous ways PLOS journals enable open science. All PLOS journals include a core set of open science policies and features, which include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Requiring</em> all data on which a paper&rsquo;s conclusions rely to be publicly accessible unless ethical restrictions apply</li><li><em>Encouraging</em> sharing of detailed, step-by-step protocols, on protocols.io</li><li><em>Encouraging</em> all authors and peer reviewers to opt in to open, published peer review</li></ul>



<p>Some journals offer enhanced open science policies or features, where a community of researchers has demonstrated a need for a different approach. <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s introduction of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">mandatory code sharing policy</a>,<em> PLOS Biology</em>&rsquo;s introduction of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/what-we-publish">Preregistered Research Articles</a>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s offering of <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">peer-reviewed protocols</a> and <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2021/03/30/registered-reports-one-year-at-plos-one/">Registered Reports</a> are examples.</p>



<p>As well as integrating new PLOS journals with relevant preprint services, we are working with our Editors and their communities to understand their needs and challenges around open science, and to explore future opportunities for new open research solutions (policies, tools, partnerships and features).</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are multiple risk factors for self-harm, including a history of abuse, trauma, physical and mental illness, and bullying. Identifying these factors is a key part of prevention, ensuring that those at risk receive appropriate support as early as possible — but despite this, predicting who may end up engaging in self-harming behaviour is still tricky.     </p>



<p>But we may be able to identify these risks earlier than we thought, a <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(21)00219-7/fulltext">new study</a> from a University of Cambridge team suggests. Stepheni Uh and colleagues report that some at-risk adolescents could be identified ten years before they self-harm — offering what the team says is an “extended window” during which help and support can be offered.</p>

<p>Participants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the experiences of young people in the UK; data has been gathered since participants were nine months old. At age 14, they had indicated whether they’d engaged in self-harming behaviour, and completed a questionnaire about depressive feelings and behaviours. At various points throughout their childhood, their caregivers had also completed a questionnaire about the child’s mental and physical health, self-esteem, sleep, their home environment, the quality of their friendships and any adverse experiences including bullying.</p>



<p>The team then used a neural network to identify the risk factors for self-harming among their participants. This also examined whether there were any distinct subgroups who had different characteristics or risk factors.</p>



<p>Two profiles emerged. The first set of children had a long-term history of poor mental health, which was apparent as early as five years old, and were more likely to have caregivers who had their own mental health issues. This group was also more likely to have experienced bullying before they began to harm themselves, and faced other problems in their home life.</p>



<p>For this group, then, risk factors for self-harm were evident up to ten years before the first incident. The findings could allow for the development of interventions that target those at risk of self-harm far earlier than is currently the case. Work on child and adolescent mental health strongly suggests that early intervention is key: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190740919314513">developing trauma-informed environments</a>, anti-bullying measures, exercises to boost self-esteem, support for those dealing with parental illness, and, crucially, well-funded mental health services, could therefore go some way to prevent further harm.</p>



<p>However, the second, larger, group did not show the same long-term risk factors. Instead this group was characterised by impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours which developed during teenage years. They also tended to feel less secure with friends and family.</p>



<p>Because teens who fit this profile did not show the same risk factors in childhood, they may be harder to identify. But the research still provides potential ways of helping these at-risk young people too, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/teenagers-at-greatest-risk-of-self-harming-could-be-identified-almost-a-decade-earlier">co-author Duncan Astle says</a>. “Given that they experience difficulties with their peers and are more willing to engage in risky behaviours, then providing access to self-help and problem-solving or conflict regulation programmes may be effective.”</p>



<p>Crucially, the study shows that those who self-harm are not a homogenous group: there are many complex risk factors associated with self-harm that interact with other life experiences, personality and more. Early responses and interventions should therefore be tailored to these individual differences rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/anole-lizards-breathe-underwater-air-bubble-snout">How some lizards breathe underwater</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some anole lizards have a newfound superpower: They can breathe underwater by trapping air in a bubble on their snouts. What’s more, these reptiles can stay submerged for nearly 20 minutes by rebreathing exhaled air in the bubble, a new study shows.</p>



<p>“As anyone who has encountered one of these lizards can tell you, they dive underwater when they feel threatened,” says&nbsp;evolutionary biologist Chris Boccia of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. But how the lizards stay underwater for so long had been a mystery until now.</p>



<p>Boccia was inspired to investigate by a story one of his professors told him when he was a student at the University of Toronto. In 2009, evolutionary biologist Luke Mahler had been studying an endangered species of <em>Anolis</em> lizard in Haiti. After releasing a lizard back into a clear, shallow stream, Mahler noticed something odd. As the animal clung to the rocky bottom, it exhaled an air bubble on its snout and appeared to repeatedly suck the air in and out of the bubble. Mahler had to move on to his next research site so he couldn’t explore more. But years later, he still remembered the bubble-headed lizard.</p>



<p>Boccia and colleagues traveled to Costa Rica in 2017 in search of bubble-headed anoles, capturing the creatures at night. “Doing this when they’re sleeping makes things less stressful for them,” Boccia says. It’s also “easier for us to catch them.”</p>





<p>Wearing head lamps to find the lizards in the dark, the researchers collected 300 anoles representing a range of species — 120 lizards were found near streams and 180 were found away from streams. Back at their camp, Boccia and colleagues gently dunked each lizard in containers of river water.</p>



<p>While underwater, all of the anoles carried a bubble of air around their snouts and appeared to breathe the bubble in and out. But river-based lizards <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/issue?pii=S0960-9822(20)X0014-5">rebreathed more often and stayed submerged longer</a> than their land-based relatives, Boccia, Mahler and colleagues report in the July 12 <em>Current Biology.</em></p>



<p>“One lizard was underwater for 18 minutes,” Boccia says. “We were starting to get worried about him.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline.jpg" alt="Chris and James Boccia handling a lizard in a stream habitat" class="wp-image-3101845" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-248x186.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101845">Researchers Chris Boccia (left) and his brother James prepare to insert an oxygen probe into a lizard’s underwater snout bubble.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101845">C. Boccia</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Anoles’ water-repelling skin might play a role in forming the bubbles. As the reptile dives into the water, a thin layer of air may get trapped against that skin. When the lizard exhales, air exits through the nostrils and expands the trapped air layer. In that way, the lizard might use its lungs to control the bubble’s size.</p>



<p>If a lizard rebreathed the air in those bubbles, then the bubbles’ oxygen levels should drop over time. Inserting a small oxygen sensor into bubbles around submerged lizards’ snouts confirmed that the oxygen levels slowly dropped as the lizards breathed.</p>



<p>To stay submerged for long periods, the anoles may slow down their metabolism, reducing the need for oxygen, Boccia suspects. And as oxygen levels in the bubble drop and CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, the bubble may rebalance the levels by shedding CO<sub>2</sub> into the water and uptaking dissolved oxygen, he says.</p>



<p>The findings highlight how different animals have evolved to live in water, says evolutionary biologist Jonathan Losos of Washington University in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the research. “Species that experience the same challenge in nature often find different ways to overcome it,” Losos says. “Fish use gills to extract oxygen from the water. Whales are able to hold their breath for a long time. And now we know that these lizards take oxygen underwater with them.”</p>



<p>Both Boccia and Mahler hope to continue studying this newfound behavior. “There are so many different types of lizards, there is a good chance that others do it too,” Boccia says. “We just haven’t seen it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">Why it’s still so hard to find treatments for early COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than a year and a half into the pandemic, researchers are beginning to get a handle on how the coronavirus makes people sick and what to do about it. That includes some valuable lessons about what doesn’t work. Now the trick is to find drugs or therapies that <em>do </em>work, especially for people who aren’t sick enough to go to the hospital. Early treatment may limit transmission of the virus and keep people out of overburdened hospitals.</p>



<p>Finding those treatments is proving to be particularly tricky. While the race to create vaccines was astonishingly successful, effective treatments have proved elusive. But they are crucial, especially because the pandemic is far from over. After seemingly gaining ground on the virus in the United States, cases and hospitalizations are again on the rise as the more infectious <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">delta variant</a> sweeps across the country (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). The variant is driving a surge of new infections globally, too.</p>



<p>“We still have a lot of people who remain unvaccinated” and at risk of getting COVID-19, says Susanna Naggie, an infectious diseases physician at Duke University School of Medicine. “The need for a safe therapy that can be administered at home remains huge.”</p>



<p>A few drugs — including the antiviral medication <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">remdesivir</a>, immune system–calming antibody therapies such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-chemicals-deadly-cytokine-storm">baricitinib</a> and <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/tocilizumab-reduces-deaths-in-patients-hospitalised-with-covid-19">tocilizumab</a> and steroids such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-steroids-reduce-deaths-covid19-patients-who">dexamethasone</a> — have been literal lifesavers for some of the sickest patients (<em>SN: 4/29/20; SN: 10/30/20; SN: 9/2/20</em>). For instance, real-world data from more than 98,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest that infusions of remdesivir <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9286/presentation/11269">cut the chance of dying</a> by <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9286/presentation/10403">up to 23 percent</a>, researchers from the drug’s maker Gilead Sciences, Inc., reported at the World Microbe Forum, held online in June. Still, those drugs don’t save everyone, and they are reserved for people who are hospitalized.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">lab-made antibodies</a> may help newly diagnosed people avoid hospitalization and severe illness (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). But relatively few people have gotten the treatment, which requires intravenous infusions.</p>



<p>While finding effective, easy-to-take treatments has been no easy task, it’s not for lack of trying. But it can seem like for every encouraging lead, there’s a hurdle. Here’s a look at some of the challenges that have stymied efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and some of the promising approaches, including some in pill form, that may still pan out.</p>



<h4>A false lead</h4>



<p>To speed the search for treatments, researchers first reached for drugs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in the medicine cabinet for treating other diseases. Most of the proven treatments for COVID-19 started this way, with the exception of remdesivir. That antiviral drug was developed to fight RNA viruses, but hadn’t been approved prior to the pandemic. It is now the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.</p>



<p>Most repurposed drugs haven’t panned out as coronavirus treatments despite some tantalizing hints they might. Now, scientists have insight into one reason why drugs such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">hydroxychloroquine</a>, chloroquine and about 30 others don’t work in people even though they stop SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells in lab dishes (<em>SN</em>: 8/2/2020). It’s all connected to a particular side effect of the drugs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir.jpg" alt="Curtis Jones lies in a hospital bed and receives a dose os remdesivir" class="wp-image-3101862" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101862">Remdesivir was the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating COVID-19.

<p>The route to this discovery began in 2020 when researchers identified proteins called sigma receptors in human and monkey cells that interact with some of the virus’s proteins. Researchers thought that might be important for infection. So they proposed that some common <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-cough-syrup-medicine-ingredient-virus-worse">antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines may disrupt those interactions</a> and might stymie the coronavirus’s ability to infect people (<em>SN: 4/30/20</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>But further investigation showed that for many of the compounds, there was no relationship between a drug’s ability to grab the sigma receptors and effectiveness against the virus when tested on cells grown in lab dishes, says medicinal chemist Brian Shoichet. The drugs either targeted the sigma receptors or they stopped the virus from growing. They didn’t do both.</p>



<p>“When you see something like that, it’s a real showstopper for someone like myself,” says Shoichet, of the University of California San Francisco School of Pharmacy. “It really makes you think, ‘Oh, we’re digging in the wrong place. There’s something fundamentally wrong with our hypothesis,’” he says. The evidence seems to indicate that targeting sigma receptors won’t improve COVID-19 symptoms, he says.</p>



<p>But of the drugs that did have potent antiviral effects, many were ones known to disrupt the way human cells build and use fats called lipids, he noticed. That disruption can lead to a potentially serious side effect called phospholipidosis. That side effect causes lipids to build up in cells, giving some cells a foamy appearance. That buildup can lead to inflammation, which can damage organs or interfere with their functions.</p>



<p>Shoichet and his colleagues wondered if that lipid disruption was causing the antiviral effect. Teaming with researchers from the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Basel, Switzerland, they first tested whether the drugs were causing the side effect in cells. Sure enough, the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708">more phospholipidosis the drugs caused, the more potently they inhibited virus growth</a> in those cells, the researchers reported June 22 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s because SARS-CoV-2 needs to build lipid bubbles inside cells where it can replicate. Phospholipidosis may interfere with that process, Shoichet says. That might be a useful property, except for one thing: The drugs that caused the side effect didn’t work in animal experiments. In mice, these drugs didn’t stop the coronavirus from replicating in lung cells, colleagues at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovered.</p>



<p>This disconnect between a drug’s antiviral activity in lab dishes and its inability to protect animals may happen for two reasons, says François Pognan, an investigative toxicologist at Novartis. Either the drugs have to be given in very high doses to cause phospholipidosis — much higher than would be safe — or they need to build up over time. In lab dishes, “it’s a piece of cake,” Pognan says. But in the body, it’s very difficult to reach levels of the drug that would cause enough lipid disruption to be protective.</p>



<p>That finding could help researchers avoid dead-ends. If a drug stops the coronavirus from growing in cells in the lab, researchers should test for phospholipidosis. If the drug causes that side effect, it should be discarded as a COVID-19 therapy.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Following that advice could impact many ongoing clinical trials and save time and money. Currently, at least 33 drugs, including the antibiotic azithromycin, that cause phospholipidosis are being tested in 136 clinical trials.</p>



<p>One trial at the University of California, San Francisco tested whether azithromycin could clear up symptoms of COVID-19 in 263 newly diagnosed people. There was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782166">no difference between the drug and a placebo</a>, researchers reported July 16 in <em>JAMA</em>. What’s more, people taking the antibiotic were much more likely than those getting a placebo to report side effects, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. And five people taking azithromycin were hospitalized, while no one in the placebo group was. An independent monitoring committee recommended ending the trial for “futility.”</p>



<p>Another 180 trials were devoted to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, which also lead to the lipid foaming side effect. (Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have other issues, too: Both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">fail to block the coronavirus’s preferred route of entry</a> and don’t help patients, researchers discovered last year (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>).)</p>



<p>Together, those 316 trials cost an estimated $6 billion. That money, time and effort would be better spent on drug candidates that don’t cause the side effect, Shoichet, Pognan and colleagues say.</p>



<h4>Helping too few</h4>



<p>Even drugs that work as they are supposed to might not be worth giving to everyone who gets COVID-19. Take interferons. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">immune system chemicals</a> are among the first to do battle with viruses (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Before the pandemic, researchers at the drug company Synairgen, a spinoff company from the University of Southampton in England, developed an inhaled form of interferon beta and were testing it in people with other respiratory problems, including MERS coronavirus infections. The company quickly began clinical trials to see if interferon beta could help COVID-19 patients, too.</p>



<p>In a trial in 101 hospitalized patients and 120 people who were ill but still at home, participants were randomly assigned to get either inhaled interferon or a placebo. Only two people in the home-care group needed hospitalization, the company said in <a href="https://www.synairgen.com/covid-19/">a preliminary report</a>. Both were in the placebo group. That’s a low percentage of people — about 3 percent — much lower than researchers expected, says Richard Marsden, Synairgen’s CEO. That’s too few to figure out how to target the drug to those who might benefit the most.</p>

Mucus is shown in green.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101863">EHRE LAB/UNC SCHOOL OF MEDICINE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The vast majority of people, even people who have health conditions that put them at high risk of complications, don’t get sick enough to need hospitalization. “They have very mild symptoms,” Marsden says. “They need little more than [acetaminophen], a hot water bottle and some sympathy, and they recover very well.”</p>



<p>About 10 percent of people will develop concerning breathlessness and some may end up in the hospital. But it’s so relatively few that you would need to treat a huge number of people just to stop one or two from landing in the hospital, Marsden says. “That’s the quirk of this virus,” he says.</p>



<p>For viruses such as the original SARS or the MERS coronaviruses, which have much higher mortality rates, it makes sense to treat everyone who gets sick right away. But with SARS-CoV-2, the severe breathlessness that sends people to the hospital usually doesn’t show up until the second week of infection. That may be how long it takes for the virus to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-cell-cilia-invade-lungs-covid-pandemic">move down into the lungs</a> and start causing damage there that interferon beta may be able to counter, Marsden hypothesizes (<em>SN</em>: 7/22/2021). So treating people at home earlier might not help anyway.</p>



<p>Results of a Phase III trial for efficacy of interferon beta for hospitalized patients are expected later this year. In the earlier trial, hospitalized people who got the drug were more than twice as likely as those that got a placebo to recover fully to a point where they had no restrictions on their activities, the company reported.</p>



<p>“It’s not worth giving our drug to everybody. Wait until they develop lower respiratory tract illness and then give it to them,” when it may do more good, Marsden says. “It’s a huge ask of a drug that it be so safe and so efficacious that you can give it to everybody.”</p>





<h4>Trial troubles</h4>



<p>Keeping people out of the hospital in the first place would help relieve the burden on health systems and perhaps prevent people from developing long-term consequences from severe illness. But it’s no surprise that early in the pandemic researchers weren’t focused on at-home treatments. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of the scientific community was just trying to save lives, particularly for patients who were in the hospital,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute think tank based in Washington, D.C. “But there was not a full concerted effort on repurposed drugs that could be helpful for mild to moderate cases.”</p>



<p>One reason for that is that hospitalized patients are easier to recruit into studies, says Naggie of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. “You don’t have to convince them to come in and communicate with the team.”</p>



<p>Outpatient studies often have to advertise, set up hotlines, send letters or call people on the phone to find volunteers willing to take part in the trial. And that can set up situations in which multiple trials are competing for participants. As a result, many trials conducted over the past year didn’t enroll enough people to get definitive answers about whether their treatments worked.</p>



<p>“We need to create a much more cohesive clinical trial system in this country,” Krofah says.</p>



<p>That’s beginning to happen. The National Institutes of Health have <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/large-clinical-trial-study-repurposed-drugs-treat-covid-19-symptoms">launched a large trial called ACTIV-6</a>, expected to enroll 13,500 people. It is similar to earlier trials of hospitalized patients that determined that remdesivir, steroids and other treatments can reduce death rates or shave days off hospital stays.</p>



<p>ACTIV-6 will test a battery of existing drugs against a placebo to see if any of them can reduce the chance of people needing hospitalization. The goal is to have five or six, and potentially up to eight “arms” of the trial with all of the drugs being tested at the same time, each in about 600 people, says Naggie, who is one of the study’s principal investigators. People getting the placebo will serve as the comparison group for all of the drugs. First up is the antiparasitic drug ivermectin.</p>



<p>Ivermectin has been used globally for a long time in various forms for treating intestinal parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions such as rosacea. It’s given to animals to prevent heartworm disease and to treat infections with other parasites. Generally, it is a safe drug, Naggie says.</p>



<p>And there are hints it could work against SARS-CoV-2. The drug had already been shown to limit infections caused by HIV and other RNA viruses, including West Nile, dengue and influenza viruses in lab studies. Researchers in Australia tested ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in green monkey cells growing in lab dishes and found that the drug could quickly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011#bib9">shut down production of viral RNA</a>, the group reported last year in <em>Antiviral Research</em>.</p>



<p>Clinical trials have pitted ivermectin against COVID-19. But the studies measured success by different standards, with some tracking viral loads or symptom severity, and others tracking time to recovery or death. Some were randomized and placebo-controlled; others didn’t have control groups. Some trials were done in hospitalized people, others in outpatient settings. Some mixed ivermectin with other drugs.</p>



<p>The results varied. Some showed a benefit of the drug; others showed no difference between ivermectin and a placebo or standard care. Those trials did have one thing in common, says Naggie. “None of them are yet definitive. The quality is not as high as we would like it to be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, health officials have <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19">recommended against taking ivermectin for COVID-19</a> outside of clinical trials. Even the pharmaceutical company Merck, which makes ivermectin, has said there is <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">no evidence to support</a> the drug as a COVID-19 treatment.</p>



<p>“What that means is please don’t go take your dog’s ivermectin or your horse’s ivermectin. It has not been proven to be an effective remedy for COVID-19,” Naggie says.</p>



<p>Her study will test ivermectin’s effect in people 30 and older who have been sick for 10 days or less. And people don’t have to leave their homes to participate. Study participants will be mailed the pills and will be asked to fill out daily surveys about their symptoms. Perhaps the trial will show once and for all whether ivermectin works as well in people as it does in lab dishes.</p>

<h4>A quick-fix pill?</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, other treatment trials are already well under way, some of which may announce results before the end of this year. Of particular interest are orally administered drugs, some of which are “looming on the horizon quite quickly,” says Yasmeen Long, director of FasterCures.</p>



<p>Among the most promising is an antiviral drug called molnupiravir (formerly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">EIDD-2801</a>), The drug mimics a building block of RNA and interferes with the virus’s replication, much like remdesivir does (<em>SN</em>: 8/24/2020). Unlike remdesivir, the new drug is in pill form and can be easily be given to newly diagnosed people.</p>



<p>Merck and Miami-based Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are testing the antiviral in a Phase III trial, which will measure the drug’s efficacy in non-hospitalized people who have at least one risk factor for serious complications from COVID-19. Already the U.S. government has <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-supply-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-candidate-for-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-covid-19/">agreed to buy 1.7 million courses</a> of the drug, if the FDA grants it emergency use authorization, Merck announced in a news release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early results of a Phase II trial of safety, dosing and efficacy found that people who took 800 milligrams of molnupiravir twice daily for five days had <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258639v1">less virus in their noses</a> than people who got a placebo, researchers reported June 17 at medRxiv.org. Within three days of starting treatment, only 1.9 percent of the 202 people taking 800 mg of molnupiravir had detectable virus in nasal swabs. That compares with 16.7 percent of those taking the placebo.</p>



<p>By day five of treatment, researchers detected no virus in people taking molnupiravir, while 11.1 percent of people on the placebo still had detectable virus in their swabs. If those preliminary results, which have not been reviewed by other scientists yet, hold up, it may mean that the drug could shorten the course of illness, keep people out of the hospital and reduce the chance of spreading the virus to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other studies, including one testing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-treatment">antidepressant pill fluvoxamine</a> (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>) and a large study of other repurposed drugs may also yield easy, early and effective treatments. “Which is great,” Naggie says, because “whether or not one trial is going to change all of clinical practice is questionable.” Having multiple studies of people who are sick at home might “help move the needle on what might be useful,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">Dimensionality reduction in neural data analysis</a></h4>

              
                <div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>It&#8217;s become commonplace to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/04/27/accelerating-progress-in-brain-recording-tech/">If past trends extrapolate</a>, we might commonly record 10k neurons by 2030. What are we going to do with all this data?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Neural dynamics tend to be lower-dimensional than the number of neurons recorded would suggest &#8211; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08088">Humphries (2020)</a> reports 10X to 100X compression depending on the area and task. Humphries suggests, with the strong principle of neural dimensionality reduction, that dimensionality reduction can show us the <em>true</em> underlying signal embodied by the neural circuit. Even if we don&#8217;t fully believe in this strong principle &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly contentious among vision researchers &#8211; many subscribe to the weak principle: the smaller, temporally smoother, and less noisy subspace can be easier to understand than the raw data.</p>

<p><em>Rotational dynamics in latent space during arm reach, from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22722855/">Churchland et al. (2012)</a></em></p>
<p>Here, I present taxonomies of unsupervised methods in neural data analysis, identify some exciting trends in the literature, and show some key gaps &#8211; a research roadmap for the next few years.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Why do we care about dimensionality reduction in neuroscience? Let&#8217;s count the ways (roughly sorted by ambition, or from weak principle to strong principle):</p>
<ul>
<li>Compression: there are practical computational reasons to compress the data down to a few dozens of dimension rather than a few hundreds &#8211; i.e. to save memory and processing.</li>
<li>Visualization: humans are not good at visualizing more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Compressing information down to a handful of meaningful dimensions makes it more feasible to plot them, and understand the factors of variations in the data visually.</li>
<li>Denoising: if we want to understand what happens during single trials, we need to denoise the data. If 100 neurons are 100 independent manifestations of the same latent variable, we can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor √100 = 10 by averaging. Dimensionality reduction flexibly averages multiple overlapping realizations of the same data to achieve a boost in signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Generate fake data: many dimensionality reduction methods are valid generative models, and we can use them generate fake neural data, for instance to benchmark spike sorting and calcium imaging signal processing pipelines.</li>
<li>Relating to behaviour: the noisy, high-dimensional neural data is hard to relate to the behaviour of the animal, which is often what we care about in the end. Compressing the info into to a lower-dimensional subspace can make it easier to relate to the behaviour.</li>
<li>Understanding computation: the latent space may represent interesting aspects of the neural computation invisible in the raw data, for example, line attractor or rotational dynamics. The dimensionality-reduced latent space can help uncover those hidden computations.</li>
<li>Untangling latent factors: perhaps most ambitiously, we want to identify latent factors which <em>cause</em> the variation in the data. Most dimensionality reduction methods don&#8217;t directly capture causal mechanisms &#8211; meaning that each logical dimension may capture several causal mechanisms. But some dimensionality reduction methods <em>aspire</em> to untangle independent causes &#8211; with linear ICA (independent component analysis) perhaps being the most well known example. Standard disclaimer: causal inference is hard. Be skeptical of causal claims. This is an active area of research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The models</h2>
<p>Given these diverse analysis objectives, we can compile a canonical model which covers a wide range of dimensionality reduction techniques.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/sketch-conventional.png?w=700" alt="sketch-conventional.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure uses assets from <a href="https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Elephant</a> documentation, released under BSD-3</em></p>
<p>Conceptually, we have a generative model which maps latent factors <em>z(t)</em> to neural observations <em>x(t)</em> via a mapping function <em>f</em> and a noise model. The latent factors evolve according to their dynamics <em>D</em>. A central goal of the dimensionality reduction technique is learn an inference function <em>φ</em> which maps neural observations <em>x(t)</em> to latent factors <em>z(t)</em>. This inference function could be as simple as matrix multiplication or as complex as an implicit function implemented by a multi-step optimization procedure.</p>
<p>To place some stakes in the ground, let&#8217;s see how these different components interact in some popular models that you might have heard of:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCA: In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the mapping function <em>f</em> is an instantaneous linear function and the noise is Gaussian (in the probabilistic extension of PCA). The dynamics are not explicitly modeled. The inference function is the matrix inverse of the mapping function</li>
<li>ICA: In Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the class of mapping functions is the same as in PCA, but during learning, the mapping function <em>φ</em> is constrained that the latent space <em>z(t)</em> is factorized into independent sources.</li>
<li>GPFA: In Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), the mapping function is again a linear function followed by Gaussian noise, but now the dynamics are explicitly modeled using a independent Gaussian Process (GP) prior. You can think of this as imposing that the latent variables vary smoothly over time. The inference is done through closed form GP inference with Expectation Maximization to learn the hyperparameters</li>
<li>LFADS: In Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), the dynamics are given by an RNN, while the mapping function is linear and the noise can be Gaussian or Poisson. The RNN implicity imposes smooth dynamics. Inference is done via variational inference in a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most important moving piece is the dynamics. To infer the latent structure of neural activity at a single trial level, with currently existing recording technology, there just isn&#8217;t enough neurons and SNR to infer latents at a single-trial level: we have to flexibly smooth through time. Complex dynamics priors require sophisticated, probabilistic methods for inference &#8211; each with their tradeoffs in terms of speed, simplicity of implementation, and generality &#8211; which is why we&#8217;ve seen an explosion of methods in the last 5 years.</p>
<h2>Taxonomies</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen some examples of dimensionality reduction methods in the wild, let&#8217;s look at some published taxonomies that try to bring some order into the chaos. I&#8217;ve annotated these taxonomies with the components of the canonical model (in red) above for reference. An early taxonomy is in the now classic review <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3776">Cunningham and Yu (2014)</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/cunningham-2014-annotated-1.png?w=700" alt="cunningham-2014.png"></p>
<p>We see the diversity of goals represented in this early work. Much of the research in the following years has been focused on building sophisticated new methods of inference that assume explicit generative and dynamics models. Dynamics allow models to integrate information over time, which makes it possible to do single-trial inference. John Cunningham presented a new taxonomy of these models in a talk circa 2018:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/cunningham-taxonomy-annotated.png?w=700" alt="cunningham-taxonomy.png"></p>
<p><em>Apologies for the low quality, it was extracted from a photo of the key slide</em></p>
<p>This updated table is a bit hard to parse, but I find it gives a lot of historical context and genealogy: we see early work on tractable models in the left column (hidden Markov models, linear dynamical systems, switching LDS) evolved into more sophisticated models in the middle and right columns.</p>
<p>With sophisticated models comes sophisticated inference techniques; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAfslStLYBo">Memming Park provided an excellent summary in a 2020 CoSyNe talk</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/memming-taxonomy-annotated.png?w=700" alt="memming-taxonomy.png"></p>
<p>Many of these methods were compiled very recently into yet another taxonomy from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01807">Hurwitz el al. (2021)</a>, synthesizing some of the earlier work in this space with cutting-edge methods.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/unsupervised-2021-annotated.png?w=700" alt="unsupervised-2021.png"></p>
<p>The acronyms are a bit non-descript, but you can often guess what each method is about by looking at groups of letters within the acronyms:</p>
<ul>
<li>GP: Gaussian Process. Gaussian processes are often used to impose temporal smoothness on latent variables, and more rarely to model nonlinear tuning curves.</li>
<li>LDS: Linear dynamical system. The Kalman filter is an example of a model with an underlying linear dynamical system.</li>
<li>SLDS: Switching LDS. A model which can switch between 2 or more latent linear dynamics depending on a discrete variable.</li>
<li>P*: Poisson. A starting P in an acronym often refers to a Poisson noise model.</li>
<li>VAE: Variational auto-encoder. A latent variable model which compresses observations to latents using an encoder down to a tractable distribution (frequently a multivariate Gaussian) and which is fit through variational inference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modelling behaviour</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that these taxonomies don&#8217;t explicitly address how behaviour and experimental conditions are integrated into each model. Some of the most interesting developments in this field relate to explicitly integrating behaviour into dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/sketch-integrated.png?w=700" alt="sketch-integrated.png"></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider a more general version of the dimensionality reduction model, which integrates behaviour, as well as external covariates corresponding to experimental conditions. Here, we have behaviour time series <em>u(t)</em> which are parallel to neural time series <em>x(t)</em>. <em>u(t)</em> could consist of time series of arm position in a reaching task, PCs of a video of a mouse&#8217;s face, or experimental conditions, for example. The mapping functions and generative models now operate on the concatenation of these times series &#8211; the latent space <em>z(t)</em> is shared between behaviour and neural data. Here, the distinction between regression of behaviour onto brain data (or vice versa) and dimensionality reduction is blurred: it&#8217;s something in the middle. This is the mental model I&#8217;m using when considering the integration of behaviour and neural data, but be aware that there are a lot of different ways of integrating behaviour and neural data that look superficially different.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my own little taxonomy of behaviourally-aware models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html#lda-qda">LDA</a>: Linear discriminant analysis. Classic technique. Finds a set of dimensions which can maximally discriminate a set of classes. No dynamics.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation">CCA</a>: Canonical correlation analysis. Classic technique. Finds a common linear subspace between two different sets of matrices. Inference and mapping both down through linear functions. No dynamics</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27067378/">Demixed component analysis</a>: Performs an ANOVA-like or tensor-factorization-like decomposition of the data in terms of different levels of conditions and their interactions. No dynamics, averaged trials only.</li>
</ul>

Embeds the latent information about conditions and behaviour as part of a VAE-like hierarchical generative model. Inspired by recent work fusing nonlinear ICA and VAEs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04809">Khemakhem et al. 2019</a>), uses flexible injective functions (GIN, a variant of RealNVP) as generative models to untangle latent causes (up to permutations). No dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exciting trends</h2>
<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>As you might have infered from the previous paragraph, I&#8217;m excited to see the progress in models which explicitly integrate behaviour. Dimensionality reduction algorithms are often sanity-checked on known low-dimensional systems &#8211; e.g. the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz system, balanced E-I networks. When they&#8217;re deployed in the wild, however, evaluating them often boils down to matching them to known behaviour and experimental conditions. In essence, the behaviour <em>is</em> the ground truth. In this context, it is a missed opportunity to not explicitly model behaviour.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself: how does a latent variable model which integrates behaviour and neural data any different than simply regressing behaviour against neural data? One answer is that there&#8217;s a shared low-dimensional bottleneck, and the structure of that low-dimensional bottleneck can reveal something interesting about neural computations and behaviours. Consider for instance <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26687221/">Wiltschko et al. (2015)</a>, who modeled the spontaneous behaviour of mice with an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM): the mouse is assumed to follow different linear dynamics determined by a discrete state (e.g. walk, pause, low rear, etc.). This is an example of a <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/switch.html">switching linear dynamical system (SLDS)</a>, which has also been frequently applied to neural data.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/wiltschko.png?w=700" alt="wiltschko.png"></p>
<p>Now imagine the same model, but this time applied to both neural and behavioural data. The inferred states would not only reveal behavioural states which are visible through an overhead camera, but also neural states like arousal and attention. In fact, the goal of PSID is to partition the low-dimensional bottleneck into behaviour-only, neural-only, and behaviour-and-neural dimensions. An ideal model would add a few more layers of indirection (e.g. discrete states, different nonlinear <em>plants</em> for the behavioural and neural components, switching dynamics) to the basic plan formulated in PSID. Think of it as interpretable nonlinear CCA (canonical correlation analysis) with dynamics.</p>
<p>What can we hope to get out of such models? One of the most surprising findings in mouse vision in the past few years is the discovery of numerous coding dimensions for facial behaviour in visual cortex (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437/eaav7893.full?ijkey=PHaXxFoO8kMGw&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">Stringer et al. (2019)</a>). At the heart of this finding is a reduced rank regression which finds a large amount of shared variance between face behaviour and visual responses (rank 16!). This is the kind of research that redefines our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behaviour, and I expect we&#8217;ll see a lot of this as tools mature.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/reduced-rank-regression.png?w=500" alt="reduced-rank-regression.png"></p>
<h3>Rich decoding models</h3>
<p>When I was first looking into dimensionality reduction techniques, it struck me that most techniques sensibly used simple, linear functions <em>f</em> to map from latent variables <em>z(t)</em> to <em>x(t)</em>. I was confused by some methods&#8217; use of powerful, nonlinear decoding functions <em>f</em>. If the goal is to find a latent subspace which is easy to interpret, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have a simple mapping from latents to data &#8211; something similar to the trusted LNP (linear-nonlinear-Poisson) model?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31244512/">P-GPLVM paper</a> (Anqi Wu et al. 2017) convinced me otherwise. To decode an animal&#8217;s position on a linear track from the hippocampus with a linear decoding function, you would need a high-dimensional latent space. If your track is one meter long, and each place field is about 20 cm wide, then you&#8217;d need perhaps 5 dimensions (=100 cm / 20 cm) to represent all the place fields. But there&#8217;s only one logical dimension (the linear position on the track)! Adding nonlinearities in the decoding (in the style of generalized additive models) fixes this deficiency.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/pgplvm.png?w=700" alt="pgplvm.png"></p>
<p>We&#8217;re also seeing efforts to fuse signal processing pipelines and dimensionality reduction. Batty et al. (2019) present a hierarchical model (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/a10463df69e52e78372b724471434ec9-Abstract.html">BehaveNet</a>) to infer latents directly from images of a mouse. Relatedly, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.434105v1.abstract">VaLPACa</a> (variational ladders for parallel auto-encoding of calcium imaging data) applies a hierarchical variant of LFADS to directly extract latent variables from calcium images. Fusing the signal processing component with the latent variable model often means using a rich nonlinear decoding model.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/behave-net.png?w=700" alt="behave-net.png"></p>
<p>Thus, we&#8217;re likely to see more papers with rich decoding models, whether they be GP, RNNs, or invertible neural networks.</p>
<h3>Mining the progress in machine learning</h3>
<p>This article started a few months ago when I wanted to have the tools to understand Memming&#8217;s taxonomy and the methods highlighted &#8211; so I took a course on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home">deep unsupervised learning</a> to have the right background. It turns out that modern unsupervised learning has influenced dimensionality reduction in neuroscience in several visible ways: using RNNs to represent complex dynamics, and inference using BBVI and VAE techniques. However, there are a lot of other advances in unsupervised learning (see curriculum for the deep unsupervised learning course) which have not yet made a big dent in dimensionality reduction in neuroscience .</p>
<p>Self-supervised learning can learn good, low-dimensional representations without explicitly learning a generative model, for instance using contrastive techniques. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04871v1">In this paper</a> from researchers at Apple (Cheng et al. 2020), they find excellent representations for EEG using a contrastive objective. This kind of approach is helpful to find good low-dimensional representations of messy signals, including, for instance, ECoG and local field potentials.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/contrastive-learning.png?w=700" alt="contrastive-learning.png"></p>
<p>Adversarial networks is another area which contains many fruitful ideas. The same paper (Cheng et al. 2020) uses an adversarial critic to enforce that the representation <em>transfers</em> from subject to subject. Indeed, adversarial methods can be used to partition the latent space.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll mention the use of normalizing flow models. Normalizing flow models are pretty slick: they learn a latent space using an invertible neural network. Learning is dead simple: you directly maximize the likelihood of the data, plus a correction for the Jacobian of the neural net &#8211; in some cases, you can even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04872">get rid of the Jacobian by using only volume-preserving transforms</a>. They&#8217;re a lot less finicky to make work than VAEs, in my humble opinion. They&#8217;re surprisingly flexible and I&#8217;d love to see them used more &#8211; to the best of my knowledge, pi-VAE is the first paper to use flow models in the context of neuroscience (albeit in a limited fashion). Normalizing flow models do have some significant limitations that will need to be worked around first (cannot directly model discontinuous distributions, latent space the same size as the observations).</p>
<h2>Gaps</h2>
<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>What method is <em>best</em> to use on your data? It&#8217;s hard to tell. Most papers are built around gaining insight into a specific dataset, and there has been little systematic appraisal of which methods work best and when (not to mention runtime and counting how many knobs need to be tweaked). Chethan Pandarinath unveiled the <a href="https://neurallatents.github.io/">Neural Latents benchmark</a> at this year&#8217;s CoSyNe. I&#8217;m a big fan of this idea and will happily contribute as soon as it&#8217;s released.</p>
<h3>Packaging and software</h3>
<p>What method should you try on your data? Most of the methods listed in the taxonomies above are not plug-and-play affairs. In practice, if you&#8217;re an experimentalist and you don&#8217;t want to waste a ton of time getting something to work, you&#8217;ll pick from one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any number of classical, non-dynamic methods implemented in <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gpfa.html">GPFA</a>, which has an excellent implementation in Elephant</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm">Linear dynamical systems (LDS) and derivatives</a>, including switching, Poisson, recurrent, and nonlinear mapping variants in the ssm package from the  Linderman lab. <a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm/tree/master/notebooks">Excellent tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>LFADS, which has implementations in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lfads">Tensorflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lyprince/hierarchical_lfads">PyTorch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google-research/computation-thru-dynamics/blob/master/notebooks/LFADS%20Tutorial.ipynb">jax</a>. See also <a href="https://snel-repo.github.io/autolfads/">AutoLFADS</a> for a variant that can automatically search through hyperparameters in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the core problems: 2018 was perhaps the biggest year for new models (based on the taxonomies I&#8217;ve looked at). It&#8217;s also a year of huge change in machine learning pipelines: Theano was on its way out, TF2.0 wasn&#8217;t out yet, and PyTorch was evolving rapidly. Many of the methods discussed here are in github repos with less than ten stars, and only work on obsolete versions of TF, PyTorch or Theano, on old versions of CUDA. Getting them to run will likely mean running inside of nvidia-docker. <code>import antigravity</code> this is not.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a path forward: benchmarking (above) should be done with existing methods using nvidia-docker, bale wire and chewing gum, and the most promising methods can then be selected for preservation inside of a well-documented package. That package could use the same conventions as sklearn (Elephant has an elegant implementation of GPFA built around this abstraction). It should pick one framework (probably PyTorch) and commit to maintaining the methods using, e.g. continuous integration. Furthermore, it should be available through a cloud platform, for instance through <a href="http://www.neurocaas.org">NeuroCAAS</a>. This would vastly increase the reach of more sophisticated analysis methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alaska-yukon-delta-visualization-climate-change-land-transition">A stunning visualization of Alaska’s Yukon Delta shows a land in transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The westward journey of the mighty Yukon River takes it from its headwaters in Canada’s British Columbia straight across Alaska. The river has many stories to tell, of generations of Indigenous people hunting on its banks and fishing in its waters, of paddle-wheeled boats and gold panning and pipelines.</p>



<p>Where it meets the Bering Sea, the river fans out into an intricate delta resembling cauliflower lobes of river channels and ponds. The delta has a story to tell, too — that of an increasingly green Arctic.</p>



<p>A composite image of the delta’s northern lobe, taken May 29 by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat 8 satellite, shows willow shrublands lining river channels as they wind toward the sea. Farther inland, tussock grasses carpet the tundra. Grasslike sedge meadows populate low-lying wetlands, punctuated by ponds left behind by springtime floods along the riverbanks from snow and ice that have melted upstream.</p>



<p>In southern Alaska, such as in the Kenai Peninsula, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">the Arctic has been getting noticeably greener</a> since the 1980s, as global temperatures climb (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). Researchers observed this change using satellite measurements of red and near-infrared light reflected off the vegetation. Now, analyses of changing vegetation in the Yukon Delta and nearby Kuskokwim Delta show that<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/aop/EI-D-20-0025.1/EI-D-20-0025.1.xml"> more northern areas are getting greener too</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Earth Interactions</em>.</p>



<p>The increasing prevalence of tall willows, an important moose habitat, is one sign of these changes in the delta. Moose populations, too, are on the rise. But for the Yukon and other Arctic deltas — where higher floodwaters due to climate change are likely to deposit thicker sediment piles, supporting more greenery — many more changes are likely to come as the planet warms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781635574944">Wild Souls</a><br><em>Emma Marris<br>Bloomsbury, $28</em></p>



<p>On the Arctic Ocean’s fringe, polar bears stand on ice thinning from human-caused climate change. Without thick ice from which to powerfully pounce on seals, many of these symbols of the wild north can’t eat.&nbsp;Should we feed polar bears to right our wrongs? Or should we leave them alone, even if that means they starve to extinction?</p>



<p>Emma Marris’ <em>Wild Souls </em>prompts readers to grapple with this question and more. An absorbing and nuanced blend of philosophy and science, the book explores what we owe the nonhuman world. Like her 2011 book <em>Rambunctious Garden</em>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-rambunctious-garden-saving-nature-post-wild-world-emma-marris">challenged the notion</a> of “pristine wilderness” in a world where humans touch everything (<em>SN: 9/23/11</em>), <em>Wild Souls </em>questions the very concepts of wildness and nature. The result challenges readers to reconsider how they relate to nonhuman animals, from caged creatures to polar bears in the warming north.</p>





<p>Marris guides readers through a series of case studies, from Indigenous hunting practices to municipal zoos, all brought to life through attentive on-the-ground reporting. Running through these examples is a central ethical tension: How do we weigh the tangible moral value of an individual sentient creature who can suffer against the more abstract value of species or ecosystems, which are of course unfeeling but rouse such depths of emotion in us when they are threatened or lost?</p>





<p>Islands are a front line of this conflict, where life that’s blossomed in isolation is threatened by species we’ve introduced. Marris examines efforts, from the Galápagos to New Zealand, to kill (often painfully with poison) millions of individual mice, rats and other creatures in the name of preserving species deemed more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marris is frank on where she stands on certain issues, arguing, for example, that zoos are immoral. She also asks whether it’s ever right to save a species like the California condor — which once soared above most of North America but dwindled to just a handful of individuals in the 1980s — by caging them for captive breeding.</p>



<p>The book makes a clear case for the moral value of individual sentient creatures, providing a rundown of the latest science that dissolves the distinct line often drawn between humans and nonhumans. These include studies that suggest fish feel pain and that rats help fellow rats in need because they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscience-mice-may-catch-each-others-pain-relief-contagious">experience emotions</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Defining the objective, inherent value of species proves trickier. “There’s something precious in what we call ‘nature,’ in the flow of energy, in the will to survive,” she writes. “But I cannot present overwhelming arguments that this is true. I can only passionately assert it.”</p>



<p>In the end, Marris finds no set formula for making ethical choices about animals’ fates. Instead, readers may realize something profound: There are no perfect ways to act ethically toward all animals and all species when incommensurable values collide. As we try to mend the mess we’ve made of nature, all we can do is act with thoughtful humility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Threadlike filaments pressed in rock <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabf3963">may be the remnants of archaea</a> that burped methane near hydrothermal vents 3.42 billion years ago. &nbsp;If so, these strands in rock excavated in South Africa around a decade ago, would provide the earliest direct evidence of a methane-based metabolism, researchers report July 14 in <em>Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth’s early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life. &nbsp;Scientists suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">life on our planet</a> could have arisen in such an environment (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Biologists have deduced that metabolisms based on munching or belching methane evolved early on, but don’t know exactly when, says Barbara Cavalazzi, a geobiologist at University of Bologna in Italy. Previous research has found indirect evidence for methane-cycling microbes in the chemistry of fluid-filled pockets of ancient rocks from around 3.5 billion years ago. But that work didn’t find the actual microbes. With this fossil analysis, “what we find, basically, is evidence of about the same age. But this is a cellular remain — it’s the organism,” Cavalazzi says.</p>



<p>The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. That shell is different structurally from the preserved interior, suggesting a cell envelope enclosing the cells’ insides, the authors write. And the team found relatively high nickel concentrations in the filaments. The concentrations were similar to levels found in modern methane-makers, suggesting the fossils’ metal may come from nickel-containing enzymes in the microbes.</p>





<p>“They can attribute a specific metabolic lifestyle to these early microorganisms,” says Dominic Papineau, a Precambrian biogeochemist at University College London, who was not part of the study and calls it “brilliant work.”</p>



<p>Yet the search for early life-forms has had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-fossil-biomorphs-more-common-ancient-rocks-real-fossils">its share of false signs</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>) , and some researchers aren’t convinced these fossils are the real deal. In silica-rich hydrothermal environments, the ingredients for structures that mimic cells mingle and can form life look-alikes through chemistry, says Julie Cosmidis, a geobiologist at the University of Oxford. “They fossilize better than actual cells, so I think it could very well be what those things are,” she says, pointing out that nickel, common in the early Earth, clings easily to organic matter, whether it’s living or not. “We don’t understand enough [about] the processes that can create false biosignatures,” says Cosmidis, whose lab studies such questions.</p>



<p>But Cavalazzi and her colleagues contend that the different lines of evidence together support the living origin of the microfossils. Papineau also notes that “the evidence is very good,” but adds that it’s “not necessarily rock solid.” Other tests could strengthen the case for the earliest methane-using microbes, he says.</p>



<p>If the strands are ancient archaea, they’d become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago. And if such microbes evolved so quickly on Earth, within around 1 billion years of the planet’s origin, methane-cyclers may be more common than realized on other planets where liquid water has been around for a while, Papineau says.</p>



<p>This fossil comes from a time when Earth’s planetary ecosystem was likely very different than it is now, says Boris Sauterey, a paleoecologist at the University of Arizona in Tempe, who wasn’t involved with this study. Back then, Earth most likely shared similarities with some of the extraterrestrial worlds that we today would consider potentially habitable, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers looking for signs of early life on Earth have explored sediments of surface waters more than hydrothermal systems, where these fossils were found, Cavalazzi says. The discovery suggests, she says, that here and on other planets, researchers should keep scratching below the surface.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>During the pandemic, many of us were locked down with little face-to-face contact with anybody other than our partners. Considering the stress of the time and the intensely close quarters we were in, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a recipe for serious tension.</p>



<p>A new study, however, suggests the reality might not be so cut and dry. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506211022813">Writing in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em>, </em>a team led by Lisa A. Neff from The University of Texas at Austin found that the pandemic actually played an important part in people’s ability to deal with stress. When couples blamed their levels of stress on the pandemic, the team found, they were happier in their relationship.</p>



<span id="more-43014"></span>



<p>Participants were people living with their partner during the lockdown in the United States, who completed daily measures for 14 days during the April lockdown and then again seven months later (almost all couples were heterosexual, though several participants were non-binary).</p>



<p>In each questionnaire, participants indicated on a scale from one to five how much they blamed themselves, their partner, and the pandemic for their current levels of stress or problems. Next, participants were presented with eleven different parts of their life, from work to finances to household chores, and were asked to indicate how stressful or problematic that element of life had been that day. They also completed measures of relationship satisfaction, and indicated whether they had performed any negative behaviours towards their partner (e.g. criticising or directing anger towards their partner, or acting withdrawn or distant).</p>



<p>During both waves of the study, participants on the whole were more likely to blame the pandemic for feelings of stress than they were themselves or their partners. And blaming the pandemic seemed to be beneficial for their relationships, at least for the female participants: on days they found particularly stressful, women who blamed the pandemic for the stress reported greater satisfaction in their relationship than those who did not. They also reported behaving in fewer negative ways towards their partners, again suggesting that the act of blaming the pandemic acted as a buffering force in romantic relationships.</p>



<p>For female participants, the pandemic seemed to act as a “scapegoat”, as the team put it, which can protect relationships from undue stress. The team suggests that stress “spillover” — the spilling of external stressors like work into a relationship — was lessened due to heightened stress awareness and ability to blame a massive global event which was a very obvious source of stress. (Of course, it’s important to remember that many people <em>have</em> struggled with their relationships during the pandemic, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/16/im-grateful-for-our-intense-lockdown-split-what-has-the-pandemic-done-to-our-relationships">in some cases</a> the unique combination of factors thrown up by coronavirus really was a recipe for divorce.)</p>



<p>This spillover was also positioned as a reason why women participants were more likely to benefit from blaming the pandemic than men. Other research has suggested women experienced more distress during the pandemic, as well as more dissatisfaction with the allocation of tasks at home and their work-life balance. Women may therefore be more vulnerable to stress spillover — and this could be why they benefited more from blaming the stress on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Future work could look at periods of more intense stress. Although the pandemic as a whole was stressful for many, most participants in this study were experiencing low levels of stress on a daily basis; the daily diary method may also have felt labour intensive for those experiencing high levels of stress, leading them to drop out.</p>



<p>People may also have been blaming their stress on the pandemic precisely because it was caused by the pandemic: it’s not hard to imagine, for example, that stress and bad feelings have been triggered by pandemic-induced job insecurity, concerns about vulnerable relatives, or the monotony of lockdown. If that’s the case, it’s not a huge surprise that participants were happier in their relationship on days they blamed the pandemic — because there might not be anything wrong with their relationship to begin with.</p>



<p>On the whole, however, the findings suggest that relationships can thrive — or at least survive — when couples are aware of stress and feel able to discuss it openly: advice that probably holds outside of a pandemic as much as it does in.</p>

<h4>How ’bout them nuts?</h4>



<p><em>X-ray CT scans reveal that jostling a box of mixed nuts nudges oblong Brazil nuts to point more vertically, allowing the bulky nuts to rest on top as smaller ones sink to the bottom, <strong>Maria Temming </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-nut-effect-mixed-nuts-xray-scan-physics">How physics helps Brazil nuts come out on top</a>” (</em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader<strong> Charvak Kant</strong> asked if this phenomenon, called the Brazil nut effect, applies to objects of all shapes — including spheres whose orientations wouldn’t change.</p>





<p>Shape affects the Brazil nut effect, but exactly how is still unclear, says imaging scientist <strong>Parmesh Gajjar</strong> of the University of Manchester in England. It is very difficult to experimentally examine mixtures of objects, <strong>Gajjar</strong> says, but size does strongly influence how particles segregate. Even spheres of different sizes in a mixture will separate. In fact, the very first study to use the phrase “Brazil nut effect,” published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> in 1987, was done on spherical objects, he says.</p>



<h4>Chaotic clocks</h4>



<p><em>As a clock becomes more accurate, it generates more disorder,<strong> Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clock-time-accuracy-entropy-disorder">Strict timekeeping creates entropy</a>” (</em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 13<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Steve Comins </strong>wondered why an accurate clock would emit more disorder than an inaccurate clock that ticks too fast.</p>



<p>In short, consistency is key, <strong>Conover</strong> says. In the context of the story, an inaccurate clock refers to one whose ticks are unevenly spaced, she says. Some ticks may come faster and some slower than they should, so you can’t predictably tell time. But a clock that ticks consistently faster or consistently slower than normal could still be accurate, as long as you figure out the rate at which it’s ticking.</p>



<p>For example, a clock that consistently ticks twice in one second could still accurately tell time; you’d just have to count each tick as a half-second. Such a fast-ticking clock would likely emit more entropy than a normal clock, but it would also be more precise, in accordance with the researchers’ results, <strong>Conover</strong> says.</p>



<h4>Fluid definitions</h4>



<p><em>A wave in one of Saturn’s rings shows that the planet’s core is spread out and bloated with hydrogen and helium,<strong> Ken Croswell </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-planet-core-fuzzy-ring-astronomy-space">Saturn’s heart is fuzzy and diffuse</a>” (</em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 9<em>).</em></p>



<p>Saturn’s immense gravity squeezes most of the planet’s hydrogen and helium, which exist as gases on Earth, into a fluid, <strong>Croswell</strong> reported. Reader <strong>Ken Koutz</strong> questioned the use of the term “fluid,” given that gases are already considered fluids.</p>



<p>While a fluid can be a gas or a liquid, physicists often use the term to refer to supercritical states, in which distinct gas and liquid phases are blurred, story editor <strong>Chris Crockett </strong>says. “That is exactly what is thought to happen deep inside giant planets such as Saturn,” he says. “The fluid there is neither gas nor liquid, strictly speaking, but it still has fluid properties.”</p>



<h4>Putting the squeeze on dead stars</h4>



<p><em>The most massive neutron star known has a surprisingly large diameter, suggesting that the matter within it is less squeezable than expected,<strong> Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-stars-pulsar-density-diameter-matter">Neutron stars may not be so squishy</a>” (</em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Jim Barr</strong> wanted to know what “squeezable” means in the context of neutron stars.</p>



<p>This term refers to how much a material compresses under pressure, <strong>Conover</strong> says. For example, if you squeeze a steel ball in your hand, it won’t get significantly smaller. But if you do the same with a foam ball, it will. And the harder you squeeze the foam ball, the smaller it will get.</p>



<p>For neutron stars, the question is whether the core gets smaller when squeezed by gravity. The more massive a star, the greater the gravitational pressure. So whether a more massive star is bigger, smaller or the same size as a less massive one depends on whether the star’s core compresses or not.</p>

<h4>Burrowing beasts </h4>



<p>Wild donkeys and horses dig water holes that benefit other desert animals, <strong>Jonathan Lambert</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-donkeys-horses-ecosystem-engineer-water-holes-invasive-species">Equids supply water to thirsty wildlife</a>” (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 14</em>). On Twitter, reader<strong> @JohnHenryDonner</strong>, who describes himself as a walking dad joke, quipped: “It’s called a burro for a reason.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-century-exploring-endless-final-frontier-space">A century of exploring the endless final frontier</a></h4>

              
                <p>People have long speculated on the existence of worlds beyond our Earth. In the 17th century’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>, John Milton’s angel suggested to Adam that there was not just life on the moon, but on “other Suns, perhaps/With their attendant Moons.” Alien realms and the captivating — or terrifying — beings that might live there have become a staple of the imagination, from H.G. Wells’ Martian invaders in 1897’s <em>The War of the Worlds</em> to the more benevolent strangers drawing smoky rings to communicate with the linguist portrayed by Amy Adams in the 2016 film <em>Arrival</em>.</p>



<p>But it has taken science a bit longer to match our imaginations. As early as the 1850s, astronomers declared that they had discovered planets beyond our solar system, but the claims didn’t hold up.</p>



<p>In this issue, astronomy writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman">Lisa Grossman</a> tells the story of scientists’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">search for other worlds</a>, and the decades of struggle it took to confirm their existence. It wasn’t until the 1990s that researchers confirmed that planets exist outside our solar system.</p>



<p>Why the long wait? There were many technological challenges to surmount, as well as a long-held supposition that other solar systems would work just like ours. And if you’re not on the lookout for something completely different, how would you find it?</p>





<p>Grossman is an ideal teller of this tale. She studied planetary science while an undergraduate student at Cornell University, and started her career as a science journalist covering the discoveries of the Kepler space telescope, which searched for exoplanets in our galaxy. Writing this issue’s story, which is part of our Century of Science project, also gave her the opportunity to revisit earlier explorations, including the extraordinary journeys of the Voyager space probes, which were launched in 1977 to study Jupiter and Saturn. Those boxes checked, the probes just kept on going, with Voyager 1 becoming the first craft to enter interstellar space.</p>



<p>Part of the great fun of reporting a story like this is being able to talk with legends in the field like Candice Hansen, who worked on Voyager and was one of the first women involved in planetary missions. “She’s seen everything,” Grossman says. “She had so many great stories; she was so generous with her time.”</p>



<p>Grossman also got to dial up Jim Bell, a planetary scientist who was her adviser at Cornell. She had worked in his lab calibrating images from the Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers. Her task: to try to figure out if the dark stuff in one image was the same as the dark stuff in another. </p>



<p>Does she ever wish she’d become a researcher, so she could be one of those folks high-fiving when a rover touches down on Mars? “Rarely,” she says, laughing. Her professional life is still focused on discovering and exploring distant worlds, with the added perk of being able to explain the science to the rest of us. We’re glad she’s on the beat, and have devoted the entire feature section to her story, as well as a gallery of some of our favorite galaxies. Enjoy!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-death-physics-electromagnetism-standard-model">With Steven Weinberg’s death, physics loses a titan</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mythology has its titans. So do the movies. And so does physics. Just one fewer now.</p>



<p>Steven Weinberg died July 23, at the age of 88. He was one of the key intellectual leaders in physics during the second half of the 20th century, and he remained a leading voice and active contributor and teacher through the first two decades of the 21st.</p>



<p>On lists of the greats of his era he was always mentioned along with Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann and … well, just Feynman and Gell-Mann.</p>



<p>Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science. He exuded intelligence and dignity. As news of his death spread through Twitter, other physicists expressed their remorse at the loss: “One of the most accomplished scientists of our age,” one commented, “a particularly eloquent spokesman for the scientific worldview.” And another: “One of the best physicists we had, one of the best thinkers of any variety.”</p>





<p>Weinberg’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/">Nobel Prize, awarded in 1979</a>, was for his role in developing a theory unifying electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. That was an essential contribution to what became known as the standard model of physics, a masterpiece of explanation for phenomena rooted in the math describing subatomic particles and forces. It’s so successful at explaining experimental results that physicists have long pursued every opportunity to find the slightest deviation, in hopes of identifying “new” physics that further deepens human understanding of nature.</p>



<p>Weinberg did important technical work in other realms of physics as well, and wrote several authoritative textbooks on such topics as general relativity and cosmology and quantum field theory. He was an early advocate of superstring theory as a promising path in the continuing quest to complete the standard model by unifying it with general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity.</p>



<p>Early on Weinberg also realized a desire to communicate more broadly. His popular book <em>The First Three Minutes</em>, published in 1977, introduced a generation of physicists and physics fans to the Big Bang–birth of the universe and the fundamental science underlying that metaphor. Later he wrote deeply insightful examinations of the nature of science and its intersection with society. And he was a longtime contributor of thoughtful essays in such venues as the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p>



<p>In his 1992 book <em>Dreams of a Final Theory</em>, Weinberg expressed his belief that physics was on the verge of finding the true fundamental explanation of reality, the “final theory” that would unify all of physics. Progress toward that goal seemed to be impeded by the apparent incompatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the math underlying the standard model. But in a 1997 interview, Weinberg averred that the difficulty of combining relativity and quantum physics in a mathematically consistent way was an important clue. “When you put the two together, you find that there really isn’t that much free play in the laws of nature,” he said. “That’s been an enormous help to us because it’s a guide to what kind of theories might possibly work.”</p>



<p>Attempting to bridge the relativity-quantum gap, he believed, “pushed us a tremendous step forward toward being able to develop realistic theories of nature on the basis of just mathematical calculations and pure thought.”</p>



<p>Experiment had to come into play, of course, to verify the validity of the mathematical insights. But the standard model worked so well that finding deviations implied by new physics required more powerful experimental technology than physicists possessed. “We have to get to a whole new level of experimental competence before we can do experiments that reveal the truth beneath the standard model, and this is taking a long, long time,” he said. “I really think that physics in the style in which it’s being done … is going to eventually reach a final theory, but probably not while I’m around and very likely not while you’re around.”</p>



<p>He was right that he would not be around to see the final theory. And perhaps, as he sometimes acknowledged, nobody ever will. Perhaps it’s not experimental power that is lacking, but rather intellectual power. “Humans may not be smart enough to understand the really fundamental laws of physics,” he wrote in his 2015 book <em>To Explain the World</em>, a history of science up to the time of Newton.</p>



<p>Weinberg studied the history of science thoroughly, wrote books and taught courses on it. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-looks-back-rise-scientific-method"><em>To Explain the World</em></a> was explicitly aimed at assessing ancient and medieval science in light of modern knowledge. For that he incurred the criticism of historians and others who claimed he did not understand the purpose of history, which is to understand the human endeavors of an era on its own terms, not with anachronistic hindsight.</p>



<p>But Weinberg understood the viewpoint of the historians perfectly well. He just didn’t like it. For Weinberg, the story of science that was meaningful to people today was how the early stumblings toward understanding nature evolved into a surefire system for finding correct explanations. And that took many centuries. Without the perspective of where we are now, he believed, and an appreciation of the lessons we have learned, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/physicists-story-science-breaks-historians-rules">the story of how we got here “has no point.”</a></p>



<p>Future science historians will perhaps insist on assessing Weinberg’s own work in light of the standards of his times. But even if viewed in light of future knowledge, there’s no doubt that Weinberg’s achievements will remain in the realm of the Herculean. Or the titanic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">What experts know so far about COVID-19 boosters for immunocompromised people</a></h4>

              
                <p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852">organ transplant recipients</a>, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lucky enough to have access to shots</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259776v1">twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised</a>, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus</a> and prevent severe disease (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0282">boosted the antibody levels</a> of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861">had detectable antibodies after a third dose</a>, researchers reported June 23 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01594-4/fulltext">stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses</a> of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.21259913v1">half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab193/6289996"> 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients</a>, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in <em>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">How do scientists calculate the age of a star?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">Turns out it was just a phase</a>.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">magnetically active</a> compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806">can give astronomers ballpark estimates</a>. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



<h3>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams</h3>



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram"> plot stars’ temperature against their brightness</a>. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>

<h3>Rotation rate</h3>



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...171..565S/abstract">propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age</a>: Rotation rate = (Age)<sup> -½</sup>.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



<h3>Stellar seismology</h3>



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler space telescope</a>. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">collided</a> with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age</a> as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">NASA’s TESS</a> and the European Space Agency’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-new-mission-to-investigate-exoplanets-has-rocketed-into-space"> CHEOPS</a> survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">A partial skeleton reveals the world’s oldest known shark attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/jomon-genes">Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/97</em>) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002777">places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago</a>, the researchers report in the August<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A roughly <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/caribarch/education/sharks/">1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico</a> previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

                <p>This month's episode features Mark Humphries, author of "<a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo">The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds."</a> We explore how the brain uses electrical signaling in surprising ways, beginning with a look at how an action potential (aka. "the spike") is produced. Then we consider what Humphries calls "the dark neurons," which are neurons that rarely generate spikes. We explore their role and also how it relates to the brain's spontaneous activity. One of the more surprising recent discoveries in neuroscience is that most of the brain's activity does not appear to be caused by external stimuli. It is not a passive receiver of information and this has profound implications for our understanding of things like how the brain generates conscious experience.</p> <p>This episode is for listeners of all backgrounds.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds</em></a> by Mark Humphries</li> <li><a href="https://www.humphries-lab.org" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Humphries Lab</a> at the University of Nottingham</li> <li>Please visit <a href= "http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additonal references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> Please Visit Our Sponsors: <ul> <li><a href= "https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=textexpander-July-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextExpander at textexpander.com/podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://NordVPN.com/brainscience" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">NordVPN at nordvpn.com/brainscience</a></li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>Support <em>Brain Science</em> by buying <a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/books"><em>Are You Sure?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Marsquakes reveal the Red Planet boasts a liquid core half its diameter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">reached Mars in late 2018</a> and soon afterward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-insight-lander-first-recording-marsquake">detected the first known marsquake</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/</em><em>18</em>; <em>SN: 4/23/19</em>). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abi7730">Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter</a>, he and colleagues report in the July 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>

<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in <em>Science</em>, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf2966">seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet</a>. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in <em>Science</em>, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8966">the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers</a>. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet&#8217;s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj8914">a commentary</a>, also published in <em>Science</em>, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Pterosaurs may have been able to fly as soon as they hatched</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92499-z">were strong and nimble fliers</a> from the start, researchers report July 22 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature known to take wing, and <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">aka “Monkeydactyl”</a>) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/429621a">flight membranes on the wings</a> of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny <em>Pteranodon</em> juvenile that was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2017.84">capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size</a>.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, <em>Pterodaustro guinazui</em> and <em>Sinopterus dongi</em>. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">not flying long distances</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">Fast scanning, triplet states and photon yield</a></h4>

              
                <p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their &#8220;dark&#8221; triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">see this Wikipedia article</a>). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing">exclusion principle</a> that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These <strong>long-lived triplet states</strong> could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming &#8220;dark&#8221; or non-functional from the experimenter&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16878313/">Borlinghaus, 2006</a>) as well as STEP microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3481">Schneider et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14766">Wu et al., 2015</a>) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (<a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.200700579">Petrášek and Schwille, 2008</a>), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that <strong>microsecond-long triplet states</strong> do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth986">Donnert et al., 2007</a>). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10193">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-4027">Gautam et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-12-5325">Castanares et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15618-w">Karpf et al., 2020</a>). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1175">Ji et al., 2008</a>), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by <a href="https://brainwindows.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/pulse-shaping-for-2-photon-signal-enhancement/">Andrew Hires</a> and on <a href="http://labrigger.com/blog/2011/12/31/optimizing-pulse-frequency-for-2p-imaging/">Labrigger</a>. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists &#8211; using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037565/">Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018</a>, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that <strong>faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield</strong>. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental approach</strong></p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+x_0+%5Ccdot+sin%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) = x_0 &#92;cdot sin( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x<sub>0</sub> = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28t%29+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+cos%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v(t) = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi &#92;cdot cos( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_%7Bmax%7D+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v_{max} = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 &#8211; 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 &#8211; 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let&#8217;s call this number the <strong>cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC)</strong> from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7Bremaining%7D+%3D+N_0+%5Ccdot+e%5E%7B-CPC%2F%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{remaining} = N_0 &#92;cdot e^{-CPC/&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, N<sub>remaining</sub>.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part I</strong></p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">Huang et al., 2020</a>). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of <strong>undesired variability</strong>.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is <strong>systematic averaging</strong>. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/12/01/matlab-code-for-instrument-control-of-a-resonant-scanning-microscope/">microscopy control software</a> myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>

<p>This finding also held true for repetitions of the same experiment at different locations of the fish brain and with slightly changed wavelength or average power:</p>

<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you&#8217;re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>

<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part II</strong></p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That&#8217;s how these experiments looked like:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we&#8217;re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>

<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>

<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish&#8217;s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>

<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>

<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample).<strong> I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. </strong>The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. <strong>Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. </strong>Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>

                <p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-infection-lung-cell-images">including viral invaders like the coronavirus</a> — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24521-x">clear tracts of cilia</a>, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-critically-ill-patient-double-lung-transplant">cause severe COVID-19</a>, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (<em>SN: 6/11/20</em>). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly. &nbsp;</p>
