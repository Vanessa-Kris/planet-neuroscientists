          <p>For this second author Q&amp;A, we spoke with Dr Alice Wang, Epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control (CDC).</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about the published research, which factors were important when selecting&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></strong>, and the overall experience.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Tell us a little about your research.</strong></p>



<p>In the past few years, my work has focused on TB/HIV. In general, I enjoy exploring various global health topics, with a focus on equity and neglected populations. I like delving into the intersection of social and environmental influences and public health.</p>



<p><strong>What are the important factors that you look for when selecting a journal for your research?</strong></p>



<p>When selecting a journal for my research, I look to see if the journal aims align with my interests. I also look to see if there is flexibility when it comes to submission guidelines, such as manuscript format and word count. Finally, I generally like open access journals for a wider reach of audience.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to publish with <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>?</strong></p>



<p>My manuscript could be considered more of a narrative review backed with multiple peer-reviewed journal articles and other respected sources of guidance documents. I had multiple colleagues recommend <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> when they reviewed my manuscript, which encouraged me to explore this new journal since both quantitative and qualitative work were considered. Additionally, I felt that <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was the best avenue to publish, since our manuscript spanned a variety of diseases (i.e. TB, NTDs, HIV) and touches upon different aspects of global health, including burden of disease, development, politics, and funding.</p>



<p><strong>What was your experience of the<em> PLOS Global Public Health</em> publishing process?</strong></p>



<p>The publishing process was easy and smooth. I was on maternity leave and juggling life with a newborn (and a toddler!) and I was not at all stressed since <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was communicative and transparent. The timeline was fairly quick and the online centralized submission system was easy to navigate.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other authors considering publishing with <em>PLO</em>S Global Public Health?</strong></p>



<p>My advice is to not shy away from qualitative work or work that is at the intersection of diseases or topics. So much of public health is siloed, including work published by journals. If we want to make true positive incremental change, it is to address the multiple aspects of a disease since everything is connected.</p>



<p><strong>Would you publish with PLOS again? Why?</strong></p>



<p>I would happily publish with PLOS again. The process was transparent and the turnaround time was quick. I like that the journal has a wide scope and even wider audience reach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/core-memory-weavers-navajo-apollo-raytheon-computer-nasa">Core memory weavers and Navajo women made the Apollo missions possible</a></h4>

              
                <p>The historic Apollo moon missions are often associated with high-visibility test flights, dazzling launches and spectacular feats of engineering. But intricate, challenging handiwork — comparable to weaving — was just as essential to putting men on the moon. Beyond Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and a handful of other names that we remember were hundreds of thousands of men and women who contributed to Apollo over a decade. Among them: the Navajo women who assembled state-of-the-art integrated circuits for the Apollo Guidance Computer and the women employees of Raytheon who wove the computer’s core memory.</p>



<p>In 1962, when President John F. Kennedy <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/fly-me-to-the-moon">declared</a> that putting Americans on the moon should be the top priority for NASA, computers were large mainframes; they occupied entire rooms. And so one of the most daunting yet crucial challenges was developing a highly stable, reliable and portable computer to control and navigate the spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA chose to use cutting-edge integrated circuits in the Apollo Guidance Computer. These commercial circuits had been introduced only recently. Also known as microchips, they were revolutionizing electronics and computing, contributing to the gradual miniaturization of computers from mainframes to today’s smartphones. NASA sourced the circuits from the original Silicon Valley start-up, Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild was also leading the way in the practice known as outsourcing; the company opened a factory in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, which by 1966 employed 5,000 people, compared with Fairchild’s 3,000 California employees.</p>



<p>At the same time, Fairchild sought low-cost labor within the United States. Lured by tax incentives and the promise of a labor force with almost no other employment options, Fairchild opened a plant in Shiprock, N.M., within the Navajo reservation, in 1965. The Fairchild factory operated until 1975 and employed more than 1,000 individuals at its peak, most of them Navajo women manufacturing integrated circuits.</p>



<p>It was challenging work. Electrical components had to be placed on tiny chips made of a semiconductor such as silicon and connected by wires in precise locations, creating complex and varying patterns of lines and geometric shapes. The <a href="https://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/indigenous-circuits-nakamura-aq.pdf">Navajo women’s work</a> “was performed using a microscope and required painstaking attention to detail, excellent eyesight, high standards of quality and intense focus,” writes digital media scholar Lisa Nakamura.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/01/102770254-05-01-acc.pdf">brochure commemorating the dedication of the Shiprock plant</a>, Fairchild directly compared the assembly of integrated circuits with what the company portrayed as the traditional, feminine, Indigenous craft of rug-weaving. The Shiprock brochure juxtaposed a photo of a microchip with one of a geometric-patterned rug, and another of a woman weaving such a rug. That portrayal, Nakamura argues, reinforced racial and gender stereotypes. The work was dismissed as “women’s work,” depriving the Navajo women of appropriate recognition and commensurate compensation. &nbsp;Journalists and Fairchild employees also “depict[ed] electronics manufacture as a high-tech version of blanket weaving performed by willing and skillful Indigenous women,” Nakamura notes, yet “the women who performed this labor did so for the same reason that women have performed factory labor for centuries — to survive.”</p>



<p>Far from the Shiprock desert, outside of Boston, women employees at Raytheon assembled the Apollo Guidance Computer’s core memory with a process that in this case directly mimicked weaving. Again, the moon missions demanded a stable and compact way of storing Apollo’s computing instructions. Core memory used metal wires threaded through tiny doughnut-shaped ferrite rings, or “cores,” to represent 1s and 0s. All of this core memory was <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">woven by hand</a>, with women sitting on opposite sides of a panel passing a wire-threaded needle back and forth to create a particular pattern. (In some cases, a woman worked alone, passing the needle through the panel to herself.)</p>

<p>Apollo engineers referred to this process of building memory as the “LOL,” or “Little Old Ladies,” method. Yet this work was so mission critical that it was tested and inspected multiple times. Mary Lou Rogers, who worked on Apollo, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8148730.stm">recalled</a>, “[Each component] had to be looked at by three of four people before it was stamped off. We had a group of inspectors come in for the federal government to check our work all the time.”</p>



<p>The core memory was also known as rope memory, and those who supervised its development were “rope mothers.” We know a great deal about one rope mother — Margaret Hamilton. She has been recognized with the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/11/22/celebrating-presidential-medal-freedom-winners-science-and-tech-garwin-hopper-and">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, among other awards, and is now remembered as the woman who oversaw most of the Apollo software. But her efforts were unrecognized by many at the time. Hamilton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/13/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women">recalled</a>, “At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realize how much they were relying on it…. Astronauts‘ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultrareliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.” Yet, little is known about the thousands of others who performed this mission-critical work of weaving integrated circuits and core memory.</p>

<p>At the time, Fairchild’s representation of the Navajo women’s work as a feminine craft differentiated it from the high-status and masculine work of engineering. As Nakamura has <a href="https://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/indigenous-circuits-nakamura-aq.pdf">written</a>, the work “came to be understood as affective labor, or a ‘labor of love.’” Similarly, the work performed at Raytheon was described by Eldon Hall, who led the Apollo Guidance Computer’s hardware design, as “<a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">tender loving care</a>.” Journalists and even a Raytheon manager presented this work as requiring no thinking and no skill.</p>



<p>Recently, the communications scholar Samantha Shorey, engineer Daniela Rosner, technologist Brock Craft and quilt artist Helen Remick firmly overturned the notion that weaving core memory was a “no-brainer” with their <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf">Making Core Memory</a> project. In nine workshops, they invited participants to weave core memory “patches” using metal matrices, beads and conductive threads, showcasing the deep focus and meticulous attention to detail required. The patches were then assembled in an electronic quilt that played aloud accounts from 1960s Apollo engineers and Raytheon managers. The Making Core Memory collaboration challenged the dichotomy of masculine, high-status, well-paid science and engineering cognitive labor versus feminine, low-status, low-paid, manual labor.</p>



<p>A 1975 NASA report that summarized the Apollo missions spoke glowingly of the Apollo computing systems — but mentioned none of the Navajo or Raytheon women. “<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt3-1.pdf">The performance of the computer was flawless</a>,” the report declared. “Perhaps the most significant accomplishment during Apollo pertaining to guidance, navigation, and control was the demonstration of the versatility and adaptability of the computer software.” </p>



<p>That computer, and that software, relied on the skilled, technical, embodied expertise and labor of thousands of women, including women of color. They were indubitably women of science, and their untold stories call us to reconsider <em>who</em> does science, and what counts as scientific expertise.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Social distancing has been a key part of the pandemic response: we all know that our chance of infection is reduced if we minimise the contact we have with others. Yet there are countless stories of people covertly meeting up with friends and family even at the height of lockdown.</p>



<p>Clearly many of those who disregarded the rules did so because of a desire for social interaction and support. But a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01052-4">new study</a> in <em>Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications</em> suggests there may be another reason too: we simply underestimate the risk of contracting Covid-19 from friends.</p>



<span id="more-45413"></span>



<p>Across a series of five studies, Tobias Schlager from the University of Lausanne and Ashley V Whillans from Harvard Business School found that people consistently feel that friends are less of a Covid risk than strangers.</p>



<p>In the first study, participants assessed the likelihood of catching Covid from a friend, family member, stranger, work colleague, or acquaintance, rating the risk of each “compared to any other person”. The team found that participants actually believed most of these people posed lower risk than the average person, but crucially they rated friends the lowest risk and strangers the highest.</p>



<p>If participants had been around strangers more than friends during the pandemic, it would make sense that they’d rate strangers as higher risk. So in the next study the team asked participants to imagine they had gone to the supermarket and met a friend, family member, cashier, stranger, and colleague. They rated the likelihood of contracting Covid from each of these people using the same scale as before, and also indicated how long they’d expect to talk to them.</p>



<p>Participants rated friends and family as posing significantly lower risk than the average person. They also rated the cashier as significantly higher risk than the average person, followed by the stranger. These results held even when the team controlled for the expected length of time interacting with each person, so it wasn&#8217;t simply that participants saw strangers as a higher risk due to spending more time around  them.</p>



<p>In another experiment, participants imagined they were out to dinner and were approached either by a friend they hadn’t seen in a while or a stranger, who invited the participant to join them. People were more likely to say they’d join a friend’s table than a stranger’s. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team&#8217;s analysis showed that this was partly because participants were more interested in having dinner with the friend, and also because they thought the friend more likely to follow social distancing rules. But there was another reason too: participants rated the stranger as a greater Covid threat (believing they were more likely to be infected, for example), and this belief also contributed to their decision.</p>



<p>Finally, the team also found some evidence that people may physically distance themselves more from strangers than friends. Participants positioned a figure on their screen to indicate how close they would stand next to someone else in a park; those who read they were meeting a friend placed the figures closer than those who read they were meeting a distant colleague. However, participants who were also reminded about the dangers associated with spending time in close proximity to others put a greater distance between themselves and the friend.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the work provides quite convincing evidence that people underestimate the risk posed by friends. And yet, the authors note, close contacts actually play a key role in spreading the disease. Counteracting the perception that our friends are less of a risk to us could therefore be an important part of pandemic communication strategies.</p>



<p>The results are consistent with other work finding that familiarity and trust is related to reduced perceptions of risk, the team notes. They are also reminiscent of the illusory superiority bias, in which we think of ourselves as “better than average” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/23/most-of-us-think-were-more-environmentally-friendly-than-our-peers/">in various</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">ways</a>. Some work has found that we also believe that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">our friends or partners are superior to other peers</a> — so perhaps this is a similar effect, where we see our friends as “better” than average at not spreading disease.</p>



<p>There are some limitations. In particular, all of the studies are based on self-report data and imaginary scenarios. The authors note that in the middle of the pandemic it would not have been possible to conduct a real-world experiment; still, it would be interesting to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">use other methods such as virtual reality</a> to look at how people behave towards friends and strangers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">The world’s oldest pants stitched together cultures from across Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>What little rain that falls on a gravelly desert located in western China’s Tarim Basin evaporates as it hits the blistering turf. Here, in this parched wasteland, lie the ancient remains of people who made one of the biggest fashion splashes of all time.</p>



<p>Herders and horse riders who buried their dead in the Tarim Basin’s Yanghai graveyard pioneered pants making between roughly 3,200 and 3,000 years ago. Their deft combination of weaving techniques and decorative patterns — displaying influences from societies across Eurasia — yielded a pair of stylish yet durable trousers now recognized as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago">the oldest such garment known in the world</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Now, an international team of archaeologists, fashion designers, geoscientists, chemists and conservators <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352226721000908">has untangled how those trousers were made</a> and painstakingly created a modern replica. The vintage slacks weave a tale not only of textile innovation but also of how cultural practices fanned out across Asia, the researchers report in the March <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>.</p>



<p>“A diversity of textile techniques and patterns of different local origins, traditions and times merged into something new in this garment,” says archaeologist and project director Mayke Wagner of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. “Eastern Central Asia was a laboratory where people, plants, animals, knowledge and experiences from different directions and sources came … and were transformed.”</p>





<h4>Fashion icon</h4>



<p>One man brought the pants to scientists’ attention without uttering a word. His naturally mummified body, as well as the preserved bodies of more than 500 others, was uncovered during excavations conducted by Chinese archaeologists since the early 1970s at the Yanghai cemetery.</p>



<p>He sported an outfit that consisted of the trousers, a poncho belted at the waist, one pair of braided bands to fasten the trouser legs below the knees, another pair to fasten soft leather boots at the ankles and a wool headband with four bronze disks and two seashells sewn on it. A leather bridle, wooden horse bit and battle-ax that had been placed in his grave indicated he had been a horse-riding warrior.</p>

<p>Researchers now call him Turfan Man because the Yanghai site lies about 43 kilometers southeast of the Chinese city of Turfan.</p>



<p>Of all of Turfan Man’s garments, his trousers stood out as truly special. Not only were they older by at least several centuries than any other examples of such gear, but the Yanghai pants also boasted a sophisticated, modern look. The pants feature two leg pieces that gradually widen at the top, connected by a crotch piece that widens and bunches in the middle to increase leg mobility.</p>



<p>Within a few hundred years, mobile groups across Eurasia began wearing pants like those at Yanghai, other archaeological finds have shown. Woven leg covers connected by a flexible crotch piece eased the strain of riding horses bareback over long distances. Not surprisingly, mounted armies debuted around that time.</p>



<p>Today, people everywhere don denim jeans and dress slacks that incorporate the design and production principles of the ancient Yanghai trousers.</p>



<p>In short, Turfan Man was the ultimate trendsetter.</p>



<h4>Fancy pants</h4>



<p>Despite being so fashion-forward, the ancient Yanghai horseman left researchers wondering how his remarkable pants had been made. No traces of cutting appeared on the fabric, so Wagner’s team suspected that the garment had been woven to fit its wearer.</p>



<p>Close examination of Turfan Man’s trousers revealed a combination of three weaving techniques, the scientists report in the new study. A re-created version of the find — fashioned by an expert weaver from the yarn of coarse-wooled sheep similar to those whose wool was used by ancient Yanghai weavers — confirmed that observation.</p>



<p>Much of the garment consists of twill weave, a major innovation in the history of textiles.</p>



<p>Twill changes the character of woven wool from firm to elastic, providing enough “give” to let a person move freely in a pair of tight-fitting pants. The fabric is created by using rods on a loom to weave a pattern of parallel, diagonal lines. Lengthwise warp threads are held in place so that a row of weft threads can be passed over and under them at regular intervals. The starting point of this weaving pattern shifts slightly to the right or left for each ensuing row so that a diagonal line forms.</p>

Tibbitts</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Variations in the number and color of weft threads in the twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers were used to create pairs of brown stripes running up the off-white crotch piece, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Textile archaeologist Karina Grömer of the Natural History Museum Vienna says she recognized twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers when she examined them around five years ago. Grömer had previously reported that pieces of woven fabric found in Austria’s Hallstatt salt mine, where such delicate textiles preserve well, displayed the oldest known twill weave. Radiocarbon dating places the Hallstatt textiles between around 3,500 and 3,200 years old — roughly 200 years before Turfan man sported his britches.</p>



<p>People in Europe and Central Asia may have independently invented twill weaving, says Grömer, who did not participate in the new study. But at the Yanghai site, weavers combined twill with other weaving techniques and innovative designs to create high-quality riding pants.</p>



<p>“This is not a beginner’s item,” Grömer says. “It’s like the Rolls-Royce of trousers.”</p>



<p>Consider the ancient trousers’ knee sections. A technique now known as tapestry weaving produced a thicker, more protective fabric at these joints, the researchers found. A third weaving method was used on the upper border of the pants to create a thick waistband.</p>



<p>Other features of the trousers involved an unusual twining method, in which two differently colored weft threads were twisted around each other by hand and laced through warp threads, creating a decorative, geometric pattern across the knees that resembles interlocking T’s leaning to the side. The same twining method produced zigzag stripes at the trousers’ ankles and calves.</p>



<p>Wagner’s team could find only a few historical examples of such twining, including borders on cloaks of the Maori people, an Indigenous group in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Yanghai artisans also showed their ingenuity in designing a formfitting crotch piece that was wider at its center than at its ends, Grömer says. Trousers dating to a few hundred years later than the Yanghai find, found in several parts of Asia, often consist of woven legs connected by square fabric crotch pieces that resulted in a less comfortable and flexible fit. In tests with a man riding a horse bareback while wearing a re-created version of Turfan Man’s entire outfit, the trousers fit snugly yet allowed the legs to clamp firmly around the horse.</p>



<p>Today’s denim jeans are made from one piece of twill material following some of the same design principles as those favored by Yanghai pants makers three millennia ago.</p>

<h4>Clothes connections</h4>



<p>Perhaps most striking, Turfan Man’s trousers tell a story of how ancient herding groups carried their cultural practices and knowledge across Asia, spreading seeds of innovation.</p>



<p>For instance, the interlocking T pattern decorating the ancient horseman’s pants at the knees appears on bronze vessels found in what’s now China from around the same time, roughly 3,300 years ago, Wagner’s team says. The nearly simultaneous adoption of this geometric form in Central and East Asia coincides with the arrival in those regions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">herders from West Eurasian grasslands riding horses that they domesticated 4,200 years ago or more</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>Pottery found at those horse riders’ home sites in western Siberia and Kazakhstan displays interlocking T’s as well. Any deeper meaning this pattern held aside from its artistic appeal remains unknown. But West Eurasian horse breeders probably spread the interlocking T design across much of ancient Asia, Wagner and her colleagues suspect.</p>



<p>Similarly, a stepped pyramid pattern woven into the Yanghai pants appears on pottery from Central Asia’s Petrovka culture, which dates to between around 3,900 and 3,750 years ago. The same pattern resembles architectural designs that are more than 4,000 years old from western and southwestern Asian and Middle Eastern societies, including Mesopotamian stepped pyramids, the researchers say. Tapestry weaving such as that observed on Turfan Man’s trousers also originated in those societies.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that cultural influences from throughout Asia affected ancient people in the Tarim Basin, says anthropologist Michael Frachetti of Washington University in St. Louis. Yanghai people inhabited a region at a crossroads of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-nomadic-herders-beat-path-silk-road">seasonal migration routes followed by herding groups starting more than 4,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>). Those routes ran from the Altai Mountains in Central and East Asia to Southwest Asia where Iran is located today. Excavations at sites along those routes indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-herders-spread-farming-around-asia">herders spread crops across much of Asia</a> too (<em>SN: 4/2/14</em>).</p>



<p>Cultural transitions in the Tarim Basin may have started even earlier. Ancient DNA suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">western Asian herders in oxen-pulled wagons moved through much of Europe and Asia around 5,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>).</p>



<p>By around 2,000 years ago, herders’ migration paths formed part of a trade and travel network running from China to Europe that became known as the Silk Road. Cultural mixing and mingling intensified as thousands of local routes throughout Eurasia formed a massive network.</p>



<p>Turfan Man’s multicultural riding pants show that even in the Silk Road’s early stages, migrating herders carried new ideas and practices to distant communities. “The Yanghai pants are an entry point for examining how the Silk Road transformed the world,” Frachetti says.</p>





<h4>Looming questions</h4>



<p>A more basic question concerns how exactly Yanghai clothes makers transformed yarn spun from sheep’s wool into Turfan Man’s trousers. Even after making a replica of those pants on a modern loom, Wagner’s team is unsure what an ancient Yanghai loom looked like. No remnants of those devices have been found.</p>



<p>The researchers suspect a loom constructed to be operated from a sitting position would have made it possible to create intricate, twined patterns. Experiments with different weaving devices are the next step in untangling how Turfan Man’s trousers were made, Wagner says.</p>



<p>It’s clear, though, that the makers of these ancient pants blended several complex techniques into a revolutionary piece of apparel, says archaeologist and linguist Elizabeth Barber of Occidental College in Los Angeles. Barber has studied the origins and development of cloth and clothing in West Asia.</p>



<p>“We truly know so little about how clever the ancient weavers were,” Barber says.</p>



<p>Turfan Man may not have had time to ponder his clothes makers’ prowess. With a pair of pants like that, he was ready to ride.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/17/new-arxiv-articles-are-now-automatically-assigned-dois/">New arXiv articles are now automatically assigned DOIs</a></h4>

              
                <p>New articles submitted to arXiv are now automatically assigned DOIs that align with their arXiv ID. This makes research articles more discoverable across search engines because associated metadata is made available to the community in a reusable format.</p>
<p>DOIs (digital object identifiers) are unique and unchanging, just like the original arXiv ID number already assigned to every arXiv article. However, because DOIs are used across many different platforms, they enable greater interoperability with other services.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1165 size-full" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2022/02/DOI-Screen-Shot-v2.png" alt="arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite is 10.48550" width="251" height="144" />“Sure, the arXiv papers have had a persistent identifier for years, the arXiv identifier, and that&#8217;s a very good thing not only for citability. But with the assignment of DOIs, arXiv now becomes even more visible as an important element of the publication ecosystem,” said Dr. Irina Sens, Deputy Director and Head of Library Operations at the Technische Informationsbibliothek in Germany, which organizes arXiv’s largest member consortium. “The DataCite metadata schema enables connections to other persistent identifiers, for example researchers’ ORCIDs and institutional RORs, and other content like associated research data – and offers easy tracking of research outputs through simple user interfaces. That’s a huge step forward.”</p>
<h4>DOIs align with arXiv IDs</h4>
<p>An author can determine their article’s DOI by using the DOI prefix https://doi.org/10.48550/ followed by the arXiv ID (replacing the colon with a period). For example, the arXiv ID <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01037">arXiv:2202.01037</a> will translate to the DOI link <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037</a></p>
<p>Adopting DOIs helps arXiv meet the ‘<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’</a> that intend to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital material.</p>
<p>DOI registration of arXiv articles began on January 1, 2022 with <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, and arXiv will soon begin registering DOIs for the entire corpus. The process is expected to be complete for all records by the end of 2022.</p>

<h3>FAQ: DOIs with DataCite</h3>
<p>Starting in January 2022, arXiv began registering DOIs and submitting associated article metadata to <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> on behalf of (and at no cost to) arXiv authors. The first articles to receive DOIs are those with 2201.NNNNN identifiers, with all new articles receiving DOIs going forward. Following the successful launch, we will begin minting “arXiv DOIs” for the approximately 2M articles in arXiv’s corpus published between 1991 and 2021. The article abstract (/abs) pages are also now updated to display the arXiv DOIs following the registrations.</p>
<p><b>Why add DOIs when there are arXiv identifiers? Are arXiv identifiers going away?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv identifier has existed for more than 30 years; we will continue supporting it and you may use it in your citations as an alternative to the arXiv DOI. We are issuing DOIs for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Making article metadata available in <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org?query=client.uid%3Aarxiv.content">DataCite&#8217;s centralized location </a>allows research outputs to be more discoverable and harvestable.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Some funding agencies require DOIs for the research they are supporting.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Will I still be able to provide an external DOI and/or journal reference with my article?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we will continue to support the existing journal reference and DOI metadata fields for linking to versions of an article outside arXiv, and we strongly encourage authors to provide them when they become available.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my new article become available?</b></p>
<p>If you have submitted an article from January 2022 onwards, we expect new articles to receive a DOI within 24 hours of them being announced on arXiv.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my older (2021 and earlier) article become available?</b></p>
<p>We do not have an exact timeline for backfilling DOIs for older articles, but we will start with articles from 2021 and go back in time. We will periodically provide updates as we complete batches of registrations.</p>
<p><b>Where will the arXiv DOI for my article link to?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv DOI will link to the arXiv abstract (/abs) using the canonical form of the arXiv identifier, so it will always point to the latest version of the article, e.g. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.NNNNN → https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.NNNNN</p>
<p><b>What is arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite?</b></p>
<p>10.48550</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-anime-convention-nyc-superspreader-event">An anime convention in November was not an omicron superspreader event</a></h4>

              
                <p>A large anime fan convention held in New York City last November was not an omicron superspreading event despite cases of the highly contagious variant linked to the gathering, researchers report in two studies in the Feb. 18 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Vaccination and masking requirements, social distancing and improved ventilation at the event venue probably reduced transmission, the researchers say. The event also benefitted from timing, as it occurred at the very beginning of the city’s omicron wave when community transmission was low.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In early December, the Minnesota public health department sounded the alarm about <a href="https://animenyc.com/">Anime NYC</a>, a convention celebrating Japanese comics and cartoons that drew attendees from across the United States and 30 other countries. The state agency had identified that Peter McGinn, a Minnesota resident, had attended the event while infected with omicron.</p>





<p>This was only the second omicron case identified in the United States — and media reports labeled the 53,000-person convention <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/health/cdc-omicron-study-anime-convention-bn/index.html">as a potential superspreader</a> event when several of McGinn’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/world/omicron-anime-convention-nyc.html">friends, who had also attended the convention, tested positive</a>.</p>



<p>But two parallel investigations into the convention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a4.htm?s_cid=mm7107a4_w">failed to find any omicron transmission outside of this group</a>. Contact tracers interviewed McGinn as well as 22 of the 29 friends in his convention group and their household contacts. Meanwhile, a second group of researchers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a3.htm?s_cid=mm7107a3_w">used data from convention organizers to search state and local health databases</a> for positive coronavirus tests among event attendees. The search turned up 4,560 results, 119 (or 2.6 percent) of which were positive.</p>



<p>Among those 119 attendees, only 16 cases were tied to McGinn and his friends. Five of the 16 cases were sequenced, and all were identified as omicron. Outside of that cluster, 15 other sequenced cases were identified as delta.</p>





<p>Because fewer than 1 in 5 positive test specimens tied to the convention were sequenced, additional positive results could have been omicron, besides the five identified ones. But the event did not spur widespread omicron transmission, the researchers found; the test positivity rate among attendees was similar to the rate in New York City as a whole in the week after the convention, about 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s nice to confirm that the event wasn’t a spreader event,” McGinn said in an e-mail. “It makes me more comfortable in the future going to these types of events as long as mask and vax requirements are in place.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that attendees who tested positive for any version of the coronavirus were more likely to have socialized outside the convention itself. For instance, 18.8 percent of positive attendees had attended karaoke venues in the city, compared with 2.4 percent of attendees who tested negative.</p>

<p>Omicron has spread readily at <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3158545/norway-christmas-party-largest-omicron-superspreader-outside">holiday parties</a>, <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/doctor-who-caught-omicron-at-super-spreader-event-says-pandemic-isnt-just-due-to-the-unvaccinated">weddings</a> and even <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/2/21-2422_article">between rooms in a hotel used for coronavirus quarantines</a>. The researchers attribute the lack of spread at the anime convention to layers of safety measures, including a vaccination requirement (at least one dose) for attendees, required masks and improved ventilation. The Javits Center, where the event took place, has installed HEPA air filters across the building, <a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/reopening-together">among other safety measures</a>; at previous points in the pandemic, it was used as a COVID-19 hospital and mass vaccination site.</p>



<p>But the new reports include limited detail about the impact that these filters had on actual air quality at the venue, says Krystal Pollitt, an epidemiologist and environmental health expert at Yale University. Without specific airflow measurements, she says, “it’s hard to know how much difference” the filters made.</p>



<p>Additionally, Anime NYC had “a fortunate coincidence” in its timing, says Ayman El-Mohandes, an epidemiologist and dean of the public health school at the City University of New York. Omicron was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a5.htm?s_cid=mm7103a5_w">first identified in New York City wastewater samples</a> on November 21, the final day of the convention — placing this event at the very beginning of the city’s outbreak, when community transmission was low.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had this same event happened two weeks later, it would’ve been disastrous,” El-Mohandes says. Future large events should add additional layers of safety measures, he says, such as requiring that attendees be fully vaccinated — not just one dose — and test negative prior to the event.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore">How lizards keep detachable tails from falling off</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lizards are famous for losing their tails, but perhaps the bigger question should be: How do their tails stay on? The answer may lie in <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1614?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D10961430194665737653988427142427029551%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1645113274&amp;_ga=2.77920528.527777432.1645022303-1147326194.1643224741">the appendage’s internal design</a>. A structure of prongs, micropillars and nanopores holds a lizard’s tail on tight enough to handle most jarring while remaining primed to drop the tail in case of emergency, researchers report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Self-amputation, or autotomy, of a limb is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">a common defense strategy</a> in the animal kingdom, including for many lizard species (<em>SN: 3/8/21</em>). But it’s a risky plan: A detachable limb brings with it increased risk of accidental loss from small bumps and snags. “It has to find the just right amount of attachment, so it doesn&#8217;t come off easily. But it should also come off whenever it&#8217;s needed,” says Yong-Ak Song, a bioengineer at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. “It’s a fine balance.”</p>



<p>A lizard’s tail consists of a series of segments that connect in a row like plugs into sockets. The tail can break off along any of these points, called fracture planes, depending on how much of the tail the lizard needs to sacrifice. Between each segment, the prongs — eight cone-shaped bundles of muscles arranged in a circle — fit neatly into corresponding sockets, consisting of relatively smooth walls. Each prong is in turn covered in a forest of protrusions, or micropillars, that resemble tiny mushrooms.</p>

<p>To uncover the function of this structure, Song and colleagues first amputated tails from three species of lizards with a gentle tug and then analyzed the broken appendages under a scanning electron microscope. Zooming in on the mushroom-like protuberances revealed that each one is pockmarked with holes, or nanopores.</p>

<p>The researchers also noticed slight imprints in the interior walls of the socket left behind by the prong’s micropillars, like fingers pressed lightly into clay. This came as a surprise: They expected that the micropillars would fully interlock within the socket, more like Velcro. Instead, the pockmarked micropillars weren’t providing any extra grip that would secure the tail to its owner.</p>



<p>Suspecting that the nanopore-speckled micropillars must play another role, the team built a replica lizard tail from polydimethylsiloxane, a rubbery, fleshlike material, to mimic the separation of tail from body. This allowed the researchers to examine the forces at work during a tail amputation. They found that the deep crevasses between micropillars, along with the smaller potholes on the micropillars’ surfaces, slow the spread of an initial fracture.</p>

<p>“If there&#8217;s a crack coming in and meets a pore, which is a void, then the crack is stopped, and then it loses energy to propagate,” Song says. In other words, the beginning of a fracture can be stopped in its tracks. Every indent and groove helps: The micropillars with nanopores enhanced adhesion 15 times more than smooth prongs without micropillars, and slightly more than micropillars without nanopores. The hierarchical structure of prong, pillar and pore achieves a balance that Song describes as a beautiful example of the Goldilocks principle: not too tight, not too loose.</p>



<p>This adaptation is important for lizards to optimize their survival. While autotomy helps keep a lizard from becoming lunch, it’s a costly defense mechanism that affects a lizard’s ability to run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measuring-leap-lizard">leap</a>, mate and escape future predators (<em>SN: 1/5/12</em>). So, it’s important that the lizard abandons its limb only when necessary.</p>



<p>This intricately designed system is a perfect example of how evolution can continually work on something to make it more effective, says Bill Bateman, a behavioral ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not part of the research. “It just blows me away.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-lost-books-archaeology-statistics">A technique borrowed from ecology hints at hundreds of lost medieval legends</a></h4>

              
                <p>King Arthur’s lasting renown is one for the books. But a statistical spotlight now shines on medieval European literature’s round table of lost and forgotten stories.</p>



<p>An international team used a mathematical formula borrowed from ecology to estimate the extent to which medieval adventure and romance tales, and documents on which they were written, have been lost over the years. Only about 9 percent of these documents <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7655">may have survived till modern times</a>, the researchers found.</p>



<p>These findings indicate that simple statistical principles can be used to gauge losses of a range of past cultural items, such as specific types of stone tools or ancient coins, literature professor Mike Kestemont of the University of Antwerp in Belgium and his colleagues report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Their approach represents a simple but powerful tool for studying culture, says anthropologist Alex Bentley of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who did not participate in the study. “It’s like walking into an abandoned Amazon book warehouse decades later and estimating the total number of book titles based on the numbers of surviving single and double copies that you find.”</p>





<p>Much medieval European literature, which dates to between roughly the years 600 and 1450, has been lost, and many surviving manuscripts are fragmentary. Durable parchment documents were often recycled as small boxes or for other practical uses. That has left researchers unsure about whether surviving tales and documents are representative of what once existed.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s team turned to a formula developed by environmental statistician and study coauthor Anne Chao of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. Chao’s statistical technique accounts for species that go undetected by researchers in field surveys of biological diversity. More generally, her approach can be used to estimate the number of unobserved events of any type that accompany relatively frequent observed events of the same type.</p>



<p>So, for example, this formula might be used to estimate the number of undiscovered archaeological sites in an early state society where the biggest settlements have been easier to find than smaller ones.</p>

<p>In the new study, medieval literary stories from Europe were treated as species and surviving manuscript copies of those tales were treated as sightings of a species. Counts of literary works with either one copy or two copies — the equivalent of toting up species sighted either once or twice in a survey — enabled the researchers to estimate how many literary stories have been lost because none of the documents that preserved them have survived. This method also estimated how many documents originally existed for stories that have surviving manuscripts.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s group estimates that about 799 literary tales survive today out of what would have been an original total of around 1,170 stories, at least for the six languages that were studied. The 3,648 surviving written accounts of those tales come from an estimated original total of around 40,614 documents, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More than three-quarters of medieval literary stories in German, Irish and Icelandic have survived in at least one written document, the team suggests. That figure fell to about half for Dutch and French tales and around 38 percent for English works.</p>



<p>Handwritten versions of those medieval adventure and romance stories — often created by individuals in the general population who avidly consumed fictional literature — have fared poorly across the board. Survival rates of those documents range from an estimated 4.9 percent for English yarns to 19.2 percent for Irish tales, the researchers report.</p>



<p>Literary documents on the islands of Ireland and Iceland survived relatively well at least partly because there were enough written copies of different stories, the team says. That made it harder for disasters, such as library fires, to wipe out all copies of specific stories. In contrast, copies of many medieval French stories were rare and thus more susceptible to disappearing over time.</p>



<p>French-speaking Normans conquered England in 1066, which may have led to greater neglect and recycling of manuscripts written in English, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Chao’s method may help to unveil cultural diversity in past societies, Bentley says. For instance, approximately 7,000-year-old villages in part of Germany have yielded about 40 different pottery styles. An analysis of the number of styles found on one and two pots, respectively, could be used to estimate the total number of pottery styles that once circulated in that region.</p>

But it is always a worthwhile reminder that these activities are never openness for openness&rsquo; sake, but are ways to enhance the <strong>quality </strong>and <strong>reliability </strong>of research, and, consequently, <strong><a href="https://plos.org/event/trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust</a> </strong>in research.</p>



<p>By establishing a global award to honor individual researchers, as well as collaborations, institutions, and organizations, Einstein Foundation Berlin is making an important statement that rigor, reliability, and transparency are to be recognized and rewarded as they directly influence increased quality in research.</p>



<p>We are excited to contribute to global awareness of this award, and encourage all interested parties to nominate and/or apply in the relevant categories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation award website</a> contains all the details, including the criteria, categories, eligibility, and a list of the jury and prior winners. The deadline for applications and nominations is <strong>April 30th, 2022</strong> at <strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>. Winners will be announced in December, 2022.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program">Artificial intelligence challenges what it means to be creative</a></h4>

              
                <p>When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little scribbles, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called <a href="http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html">AARON</a> to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then set it loose making art.</p>



<p>Not far behind was the composer <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/">David Cope</a>, who coined the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope <a href="https://newatlas.com/creative-artificial-intelligence-computer-algorithmic-music/35764/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body">once told me</a> that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to painstakingly draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially tinkered with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.</p>

<p>Cohen and Cope were among a handful of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-nascent field of AI had its focus set squarely on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers balked at the notion of creative machines.</p>



<p>Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope cranked out a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing cohort of researchers and eventually its own <a href="https://jcc.computationalcreativity.net/">journal</a> and <a href="https://computationalcreativity.net">annual event</a>.</p>

<p>Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to mirror the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.</p>



<p>Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the <a href="http://www.thepaintingfool.com/">Painting Fool</a>. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the sentiment and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).</p>

<p>Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating <a href="https://gamesbyangelina.itch.io/">ANGELINA</a> — which made simple games based on news articles from <em>The Guardian</em>, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.</p>



<p>During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on mimicry, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.</p>



<p>New techniques that excelled at classifying data to high degrees of precision through repeated analysis helped AI master existing creative styles. AI could now create works like those of classical composers, famous painters, novelists and more.</p>



<p>One AI-authored painting modeled on thousands of portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx">sold</a> for $432,500 at auction. In another case, study participants struggled <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dissertation.pdf">to differentiate the musical phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach from those</a> created by <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/kulitta/">a computer program called Kulitta</a> that had been trained on Bach’s compositions. Even IBM got in on the fun, tasking its Watson AI system with <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/how-ibm-chef-watson-works">analyzing 9,000 recipes</a> to devise its own cuisine ideas.</p>



<p>But many in the field, as well as onlookers, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-and-creativity/">wondered if these AIs really showed creativity</a>. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as <a href="http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc20/papers/164-iccc20.pdf">requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge”</a> in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs converged toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.</p>





<p>In order to make the step to true creativity, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/abs/big-data-and-creativity/E604C40A897436521970E110F8E1FBBA">Dahlstedt suggested</a>, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”</p>



<p>True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.</p>



<p>In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But <a href="https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/simon-colton/">he wonders</a> whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.</p>



<p>If an AI lacks the self-awareness to reflect on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?</p>



<p>Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” <a href="https://core.ac.uk/display/326027014">writes</a> philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/17/people-who-apologise-a-lot-are-seen-as-more-warm-and-sincere/">People who apologise a lot are seen as more warm and sincere</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><em>We all know a chronic apologiser (maybe you are one).</em> So begins a fascinating <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211065286">new paper</a> that explores how we judge frequent vs rare apologisers — and how this affects the way that we react to their apologies.</p>



<p>An abundance of work has shown that an apology for bad behaviour makes a big difference to the recipient. “Indeed, some scholars even imbue apologies with transformative and miraculous healing qualities,” note Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. However, most research in this field has explored the impact of apologies in isolation. This takes no account of a person’s general tendency to apologise. But as we all know, some people apologise readily and frequently, while others don&#8217;t.</p>



<span id="more-45403"></span>



<p>To explore how people judge frequent and infrequent apologisers, the team focused on perceptions of &#8220;communion&#8221; and &#8220;agency&#8221;. Someone high in communion strives for harmony in relationships; they show warmth and a sense of morality, and a care for the interests of others. Agency is more about the individual. A high-agency person is in control of their life; they are seen as being more dominant, powerful, competent and autonomous.</p>



<p>In an initial online study, 406 adults read one of two stories about a fictional character’s typical week. Both stories featured 12 &#8220;apology situations&#8221;, which were set at work, in a restaurant, with a friend, and so on. In six of these situations, the character had done something that clearly warranted an apology; in the other six, while an apology wasn’t unreasonable, it wasn’t necessary (apologising after interrupting the boss’s workday to ask a question, for example).</p>



<p>In one version of the story, the character apologised in all 12 instances. In the other, they didn’t apologise at all. And the results were clear: the frequent apologiser was judged to be more communal but less agentic than the non-apologiser. Frequent apologising entailed a trade-off, then — but as communion is more important for judgements of what someone else is &#8220;like&#8221;, it could be worth giving up some perceived agency to get a communion boost.</p>



<p>In a second online study, 300 people who had been in a romantic relationship for at least six months reported on how frequently their partner apologised, and also how sincere and considered their partner’s apologies tended to be. Then they rated their partners for communion and agency. As in the first study, frequent apologisers were seen as being more communal. But this time, they were only rated as being lower in agency <em>if </em>their apologies were typically poor.</p>



<p>Why do frequent but good apologisers avoid taking a hit to their perceived agency? Although accepting a personal wrongdoing carries a cost, giving an excellent, thoughtful apology could also signal that you are skilled at interacting with others — and so competent and in control. Together, these two findings suggest that people should bear in mind both the frequency and quality of their apologies, the researchers note.</p>



<p>The second study also had another component: the participants were asked to imagine that their partner had ridiculed their personal beliefs about a sensitive topic behind their back to a group of friends. They then received one of three fictional responses from their partner. One was unapologetic (&#8220;It was no big deal&#8221;). Another contained a weak apology (&#8220;I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to&#8221;). In the third, the apology was thoughtful, extensive and expressed sincere regret. The team found that, as might be expected, the high-quality apologies were received best: they resulted in higher scores for feelings of being cared for and for relationship satisfaction. However, a weak apology from a partner who routinely gave strong apologies wasn’t received as badly as the same apology from a partner who was typically bad at apologising. So someone who is generally good at apologising may get the odd free pass.</p>



<p>One notable additional finding from the studies was that whether the apologiser was male or female made no difference to the communion and agency ratings that they received. “Recent media reports suggest that women should refrain from apologising frequently because it undermines their competence,” the team observes. However, this new work suggests that men and women are equally affected in this way. Still, as they also note, &#8220;typical women&#8221; are judged to be higher in communion and lower in agency than men. So a woman who apologises often might take more of an agency &#8220;hit&#8221; than a man who does the same. This could be more of an issue in the workplace, perhaps — and this clearly needs investigating. It would also be interesting to know how we judge people who apologise for all kinds of things that aren’t their fault — such as when someone else bumps into them in the street.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that few people either apologise all the time or never, as in the first study. And the fictional misdeed in the second study was pretty serious. So the team’s findings might not apply in most everyday scenarios. Still, they feel that the key takeaway message is this: “Apologizing frequently… seems to be beneficial on the whole, and the observed cost to agency appears to be avoidable if one consistently crafts high-quality apologies.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunlight-oil-spills-clean-up-ocean-solar-radiation-deepwater-horizon">Sunlight helps clean up oil spills in the ocean more than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sunlight may have helped remove as much as 17 percent of the oil slicking the surface of the Gulf of Mexico following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. That means that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl7605">sunlight plays a bigger role</a> in cleaning up such spills than previously thought, researchers suggest February 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>When sunlight shines on spilled oil in the sea, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunshine-making-deepwater-horizon-oil-stick-around">can kick off a chain of chemical reactions</a>, transforming the oil into new compounds (<em>SN: 6/12/18</em>). Some of these reactions can increase how easily the oil dissolves in water, called photodissolution. But there has been little data on how much of the oil becomes water-soluble.</p>



<p>To assess this, environmental chemists Danielle Haas Freeman and Collin Ward, both of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, placed samples of the Macondo oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on glass disks and irradiated them with light using LEDs that emit wavelengths found in sunlight. The duo then chemically analyzed the irradiated oil to see how much was transformed into dissolved organic carbon.</p>



<p>The most important factors in photodissolution, the researchers found, were the thickness of the slick and the wavelengths of light. Longer wavelengths (toward the red end of the spectrum) dissolved less oil, possibly because they are more easily scattered by water, than shorter wavelengths. How long the oil was exposed to light was not as important.</p>



<p>Though the team didn’t specifically test for seasonal or latitude differences, computer simulations based on the lab data suggested that those factors, as well as the oil’s chemical makeup, also matter.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate irradiation helped dissolve from 3 to 17 percent of surface oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, comparable to processes such as evaporation and stranding on coastlines. What impact the sunlight-produced compounds might have on marine ecosystems, however, isn’t yet known.&nbsp;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/virus-g9838c9810_1920-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Over two years into the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic there is no agreement on the best way to predict outcome or measure severity of disease. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.063?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">A 2021 review of over 100 prognostic modeling approaches</a> recommended none be used because of concerns over validity and biases in their development.</p>
<p>A recent BMC article “<a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Seek COVER: using a disease proxy to rapidly develop and validate a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes in an international network</a>” introduces a novel approach to this challenge, the use of Influenza data. There was substantial existing data on outcomes from influenza at the beginning of the pandemic. With SARS-CoV-2 also being a respiratory pathogen, could there be insights from influenza cases that would prove useful for COVID-19?</p>
<p>The study by Williams and co-authors uses an eclectic combination of claims and clinical databases from multiple countries collected from 2006-2020. Over 7 million primarily outpatient influenza cases were assembled in a common dataset. It is recognized that the quality and consistency of these electronic data is very variable. Some of the databases used lacked any variables except age and sex whilst others did not consistently record outcomes.</p>
<p>The cases selected for initial model development, however, were a random selection of 150,000 cases drawn from 2,082,077 adult outpatients with a new influenza diagnosis and a follow up of 365 days. A smaller cohort of 44,507 patients treated from January 1 to April 27 of 2020 with a diagnostic code for COVID-19 were used for one of multiple external validations.</p>
<p>The modeling effort began as a data driven regression effort resulting in 31,917 potential predictors. Acknowledging the complexity of using a model with so many predictors the investigators had clinicians examine the distribution of variables for cases with and without the three outcomes they sought to predict. These were being hospitalized with pneumonia (COVER-H), being hospitalized with pneumonia and requiring intensive care services or dying (COVER-I) or death within 30 days after initial diagnosis regardless of the intensity of treatment (COVER-F). The reduced regression models still had hundreds of predictors. So, two simplified models were created. One had age and sex, whilst the other combined age and sex with seven common co-morbid conditions such as cancer or heart disease. The latter was converted into an easy-to-use calculator for the probability of outcomes.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this extraordinary compilation of cases and ambitious modeling efforts?  First the results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is much more dangerous than Influenza. When the COVER modeling efforts were validated, discrimination varied greatly across datasets and countries, and most models were not well calibrated. This was true with their COVID-19 database, and especially within the one dataset containing hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>An editorial by Peterson, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30577-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">COVID-19 is Not Influenza</a>”, discussed the comparison of nearly 90,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients to approximately 45,000 with influenza. They found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30527-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">dramatic differences</a> in outcomes with COVID-19 being substantially more lethal.  As the COVER authors acknowledge this means their models would need to be re-calibrated by country for the increased risk that COVID-19 presents over contracting influenza.</p>
<p>Second, the well acknowledged major vulnerabilities of age and existing comorbidities that are prominent in most COVID-19 models were also identified as important risk factors in COVER. In the well-received <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3731?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">QCOVID 1 model</a> based on the U.K.’s QResearch 10.5 million population registry, age and co-morbid conditions along with a measure of economic deprivation produced accurate risk stratification for the likelihood of catching COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome (hospital admission or death) in the initial two stages of the pandemic within that country.</p>
<p>Both models also illustrate that when a very large outpatient (COVER) or population-based registry (QCOVID 1) are used for modeling, the absolute risk of severe outcomes for an individual is low. The COVER models frequently produce probabilities of serious complications between 0.01%-1%. QCOVID 1 model risk levels for contracting COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome are higher, 0.1-2%. Unfortunately, as has been tragically demonstrated, when even these small risks occur in hundreds of millions of people, hospitalizations and deaths also number in the millions.</p>
<p>The developers of the COVER models emphasize that their overall goal was to illustrate a methods development process as opposed to a model for immediate clinical impact. At the beginning of the pandemic this was an appropriate effort. They should be commended for assembling a very large common dataset, for convening a worldwide collection of investigators, and creating a clinically plausible influenza model.</p>
<p>But a large well-maintained population data registry like QResearch and modeling conducted by an established New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) in the U.K. describe an alternative approach. We may be coming to the realization that replicating these two resources now in other countries could be the most appropriate response to this pandemic, and a path to being much better prepared for the next one.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudge-theory-behavioral-science-psychology-structural-change">Nudge theory’s popularity may block insights into improving society</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine removing a branch of the U.S. government, say the Supreme Court. What are the myriad ways that such an upheaval might reshape people’s lives?</p>



<p>Policy makers and researchers probably would want to have an idea of what those effects might be before erasing the highest court in the land. But “you can’t test deep structural changes like that in an experiment” first, says behavioral decision–making expert David Gal of the University of Illinois Chicago.</p>

<p>Likewise, less wildly hypothetical but perhaps still far-reaching changes to society, such as expanding Social Security or providing universal parental leave, can’t be tested with conventional experiments that include control and experimental groups. As a result, many behavioral scientists today have instead turned to researching “nudges” — smaller interventions that operate within existing policies. Nudges can influence human behavior, research suggests, and can be readily tested using experiments before being applied.</p>



<p>But this recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00002-2">overreliance on nudges has stifled broader behavioral science research</a> and insights into how to create a better society, Gal and marketing expert Derek Rucker of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., contend January 12 in a commentary in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Nudges exploded in popularity in 2008 when economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago and law professor Cass Sunstein of Harvard University published a book on the topic. That research <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/richard-thaler-nobel-economic-sciences">netted Thaler a Nobel Prize</a> in Economic Sciences and inspired governments worldwide to set up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudging-people-make-good-choices-can-backfire">nudge units</a> to modify or create public policies (<em>SN: 10/9/17</em>; <em>SN:</em><em> 3/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>Examples of nudges include offering small cash rewards to encourage people to get a new vaccine or sending text reminders about a looming deadline. For instance, researchers recently revamped a court summons form and sent text reminders to get more people to attend mandatory court appointments in New York City. The intervention <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudge-behavior-easy-interventions-help-people-show-up-court">increased court attendance</a> by roughly 20 percent over previous years, the researchers estimate (<em>SN: 10/08/20</em>).</p>





<p>But such nudges ignore thornier societal problems, such as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abc2495">over-policing in low-income neighborhoods</a> where these summons are typically issued, lawyer and sociologist Issa Kohler-Hausmann of Yale University wrote in a perspective piece that accompanied the research.</p>



<p>“Changing the approach to penal and welfare policy in our country will require interventions that are much more radical than cost-neutral behavioral nudges that everyone can agree on,” Kohler-Hausmann wrote.</p>



<p>Policy makers love nudges, Gal argues. “They don’t have to change anything fundamental.”</p>

<p>As for behavioral scientists, Gal and Rucker attribute nudges’ popularity to the scientists’ desire to mimic the precision of researchers in other fields. Medical researchers, for instance, can test pharmaceutical drugs using randomized controlled trials. With that scientific gold standard, researchers compare outcomes among patients receiving the drugs versus a placebo. Nudge researchers can likewise generate a small change — the drug — and compare outcomes among those who experience the change with those who do not.</p>



<p>“We value experiments because they give us statistically precise estimates,” Gal says.</p>



<p>But nudges that work in the lab often fail in the real world, the authors note. In one analysis, lab studies of 74 nudges and roughly half a million participants increased the desired behavior by an average of 8.7 percentage points, researchers reported in a 2020 working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research. But similar real-world studies of 243 nudges affecting over 23 million people increased the desired behavior by an average of just <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27594/w27594.pdf">1.4 percentage points</a>.</p>



<p>Rather than chasing statistical precision, Gal would like to see behavioral scientists generate overarching theories that apply beyond a single narrow context. For instance, in the U.S. legal system, juries must reach a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant. But research into conformity suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-may-be-especially-vulnerable-peer-pressure-robots">people copy others</a> as a result of social pressure (<em>SN: </em><em>8/15/18</em>). Unlike nudges, that research can generate insights into how human behavior interfaces with existing practices, Gal says, and raise crucial questions. In this case, is the push for unanimity preventing jurors from raising valid concerns during deliberations? “Even one dissenter can really reshape the debate and stop this tendency toward conformity,” Gal says.</p>



<p>There’s room for both theoretical and applied behavioral scientists in the field, counters data scientist Kevin Wilson of the Policy Lab, a policy research institute at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “We need people who think about theory, who are really synthesizing these lessons and, as they put it, extrapolating insights. But we also need people who are going to … utilize these insights.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, nudges are hogging all the attention, Kohler-Hausmann says. Like policy makers, funding agencies and research journal editors seem to prefer the quantifiable results that nudges offer, she says, and that near singular focus has hindered transformational change. “The cost of a narrowly defined intervention is ruling out the study of more compound, complex interventions.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Stavros Anagnou will talk about a paper
&quot;Spurious Normativity Enhances Learning of Compliance and Enforcement Behavior
in Artificial Agents&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>How do societies learn and maintain social norms? Here we use multiagent
reinforcement learning to investigate the learning dynamics of enforcement and
compliance behaviors. Artificial agents populate a foraging environment and
need to learn to avoid a poisonous berry. Agents learn to avoid eating
poisonous berries better when doing so is taboo, meaning the behavior is
punished by other agents. The taboo helps overcome a credit assignment problem
in discovering delayed health effects. Critically, introducing an additional
taboo, which results in punishment for eating a harmless berry, further
improves overall returns. This &quot;silly rule&quot; counterintuitively has a positive
effect because it gives agents more practice in learning rule enforcement. By
probing what individual agents have learned, we demonstrate that normative
behavior relies on a sequence of learned skills. Learning rule compliance
builds upon prior learning of rule enforcement by other agents. Our results
highlight the benefit of employing a multiagent reinforcement learning
computational model focused on learning to implement complex actions.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Therapeutic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy or dialectical behavioural therapy often focus on the development of skills, such as ways to identify and actively challenge particular patterns of thought, feeling or behaviour. Indeed, research into CBT has found that the development of such skills can lead to fewer and less distressing symptoms and a reduced risk of relapse.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.23302">new study</a> looks at what happens when these interventions are explicitly framed around our strengths or weaknesses. Writing in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, the team from Ohio State University finds that focusing on skills that are particular strengths can help people recover from sad moods faster.</p>



<span id="more-45383"></span>



<p>Participants first answered questions about their cognitive behavioural skills and were told they would receive feedback on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<p>They were then told they had been assigned a useful skill to learn about and were encouraged to write notes on how it could be used in daily life. In one condition, participants read about cognitive reappraisal — identifying and reevaluating negative thoughts — while in the other they read about mindfulness — awareness and acceptance of one’s thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, some participants were told they had been assigned the skill as it was their strongest skill based on initial measures, while others were told it was their weakest.</p>



<p>After rating their mood, participants took part in a mood induction procedure, imagining someone they cared about dying and reflecting on how it made them feel, while listening to a piece of moving classical music. Immediately after this procedure, they were told use their assigned skill to regulate their emotions, while repeatedly indicating how they felt. Finally, they reported how useful they thought the skill would be.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering the subject matter, mood indeed dropped during the mood induction: 81% of participants felt worse immediately after the task. However, as participants utilised their skills their mood improved, with 25% returning to their initial mood. Importantly, participants who had read that their skill was a strength of theirs tended to show a more rapid mood recovery than those who had read it was a weakness, suggesting that this framing had an impact on the success of the skill.</p>



<p>Future research could explore why a focus on particular individual strengths leads to a faster recovery of mood — participants didn’t <em>expect </em>a focus on strengths to be any more effective than a focus on weakness, suggesting that the result wasn’t simply due to participants’ expectations. It’s also important to note that the effects were small. Further research would also need to include people with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression and look at effects over a longer period of time. Adding in a neutral condition, where skills are framed neither around strengths nor weakness, could also provide insight. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/15/arxiv-adds-new-logo-to-the-website/">arXiv adds new logo to the website</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are pleased to share the news that arXiv recently added its new logo to the website.</p>
<p>This new logo began its incremental rollout in 2021 in our communications documents, 30th anniversary materials, and other channels. That process continues in 2022 with the rollout of the new logo on the website. Though in one light it is a small change, it is also major a milestone for protecting arXiv&#8217;s identity and we are pretty excited.</p>
<h3>Why change the logo?</h3>
<p>arXiv’s long-time logo was found, through a legal review in 2020, to have no legal defensibility. In order to protect arXiv’s unique and incredible service we needed a legally defensible identity. Starting in 2020, and involving a diverse team of researchers and design experts, we completed a branding process culminating in a new logo.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-948 aligncenter" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png" alt="arXiv's logo" width="217" height="98" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png 1024w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-768x346.png 768w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></p>
<p>arXiv&#8217;s new logo embodies our core identity, with the two arms of the arXiv chi intertwine into a united symbol of <b>arXiv as a place of connection</b> and a hub of the research ecosystem. Our mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the <b>legibility, memorability, and legal defensibility</b> arXiv needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We are excited about the meaning and hard work behind the new logo, and to share it with the community on a platform as important as the arXiv website.</p>
<h3>What is next?</h3>
<p>arXiv has more design goals for the website, including making it fully accessible, increased usability for mobile, and improved efficiency for submitters and readers alike. We will continue to listen to our communities and learn what will make arXiv a more useful tool. We welcome and value your experience, and invite you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing">join the arXiv user testing group here</a> if you would like to take part in future surveys or rounds of feedback.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS published the following press release on February 15, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that <em>PLOS Water</em> has published its initial cohort of papers. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to connect researchers across the hydrology, water resources, and water, sanitation and hygiene communities, amplifying a diverse set of voices to influence the global discourse around water. The journal has so far received more than 60 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a vitally important area of research. While the amount of water on earth is essentially fixed, demand for water continues to rise with population growth and increasing living standards,&rdquo; said Jenna Davis, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>. &ldquo;It has never been more important to connect scholars and practitioners working to close the gap in access to water and sanitation services with those focused on managing freshwater resources in a changing climate.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are confident that our broad scope will integrate water sciences and water practices, bringing together in one place research of the highest methodological and ethical standards, from all continents and global regions,&rdquo; said Pierre Horwitz, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>



<p>PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and <em>PLOS Water</em> now joins these journals with papers ready for publication. The journal is underpinned by PLOS&rsquo; new<a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a> designed to remove financial barriers for researchers and institutions across all geographies and funding backgrounds to participate in Open Access and Open Science at PLOS. PLOS is partnering with institutions in this modelto provide unlimited publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is based on each institution&rsquo;s historical research output in the field and is reflective of their regional economy according to their country&rsquo;s World Bank lending tier. PLOS&rsquo; existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our journal&rsquo;s Open Science policies will help establish preprinting and sharing of data and code in water research communities. Early, unrestricted access to vetted data and papers will empower researchers, local and Indigenous communities, water professionals, and organizations from across the globe to take evidence-based action to address some of the most pressing issues our planet faces,&rdquo; said Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS.</p>



<p>The current Editorial Board is comprised of more than 70 Academic Editors and 19 Section Editors representing more than 32 countries. Submissions have been received from researchers in Chile, Uganda, Switzerland, Australia, Eswatini, the US, and 10 other countries, marking the global reach of <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780226798332">From Data to Quanta</a><br><em>Slobodan Perović</em><br><em>Univ. of Chicago, $45</em></p>



<p>Ever since Max Planck introduced the idea of the quantum to the world, physicists have argued about whether reality is more like sand or water.</p>



<p>Planck’s famous 1900 discovery that energy is grainy — at least when absorbed or emitted — moved him to label those smallest bits of energy grains “quanta.” But he believed that once emitted, as in light from a fire, those grains merged into smooth, continuous waves, just as water seems a smooth liquid to human perception. Einstein, on the other hand, insisted that light quanta traveled through space on their own, behaving like particles later called photons.</p>





<p>By the mid-1920s, both the wave and particle views of light had gained experimental support, with the additional paradox that electrons — supposedly particles — could sometimes disguise themselves as waves.</p>



<p>Into this arena of controversy stepped the famed Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the pioneer of exploring the architecture of the atom. Bohr announced that resolving the wave-particle paradox required a new view of reality, in which both notions shared a role in explaining experimental phenomena. In experiments designed to observe waves, waves you would find, whether electrons or light. In experiments designed to detect particles, you’d see particles. But in no experiment could you demonstrate both at once. Bohr called this viewpoint the principle of complementarity, and it successfully guided the pursuit of quantum mechanics during the following decades.</p>



<p>More recently, as philosopher Slobodan Perović recounts in <em>From Data to Quanta</em>, Bohr’s success has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beyond-weird-and-what-real-try-make-sense-quantum-weirdness">questioned by some physicists and philosophers</a> and even popular science writers (<em>SN: 1/19/19, p. 26</em>). Complementarity has been derided as an incoherent application of vague philosophy expressed in incomprehensible language. But as Perović’s investigations reveal, such criticisms are rarely rooted in any deep understanding of Bohr’s methods. Rather than Bohr’s philosophy contaminating his science, Perović argues, it is his opponents’ philosophical prejudices that have led to misstatements, misunderstandings and misrepresentations of Bohr’s physics. And Bohr can’t be understood by attempting to understand his philosophy, Perović asserts, because philosophy did not guide him — experiments did.</p>



<p>In fact, Bohr’s drive to understand the wave-particle paradox was fueled by a deep devotion to comprehending the experimental evidence in its totality. It was the same approach the younger Bohr took when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-atom-went-quantum">developing his model of the atom in 1913</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/13, p. 20</em>). Various experiments suggested properties of the atom that seemed irreconcilable. But Bohr forged those experimental clues into a “master hypothesis” that produced a thoroughly novel understanding of the atom and its structure.</p>





<p>Perović describes how Bohr’s process began with lower-level hypotheses stemming from features directly given by experiment. Spectral lines — different specific colors of light emitted by atoms — led to basic hypotheses that some vibratory process, of an atom itself or its constituents, produced electromagnetic radiation exhibiting precise patterns. Intermediate hypotheses about the structure of the atom did not explain such lines, though. And then Ernest Rutherford, on the basis of experiments in his lab, inferred that an atom was mostly empty space. It contained a dense, tiny central nucleus encompassing most of the mass, while lightweight electrons orbited at a distance. But that hypothesis didn’t mesh with the precise patterns of spectral lines. And such an atom would be unstable, persisting for less than a millisecond. From all these disparate experiment-based hypotheses, Bohr applied Planck’s quantum idea to construct a master hypothesis. He reconciled the spectral lines and Rutherford’s nuclear atom with a new atomic model, in which electrons maintained stability of the atom but jumped from one orbit to another, emitting specific patterns of spectral lines in the process.</p>



<p>As Perović demonstrates, Bohr followed a similar course in arriving at complementarity. While numerous experiments showed that light was a wave, by the early 1920s other experiments established that X-rays, highly energetic light, collided with electrons just as though both were particles (momentum and energy were conserved in the collisions just as the particle view required). Bohr’s master hypothesis, complementarity, seemed the only way forward.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Perović relates how Bohr has been misinterpreted, his views misleadingly conflated with those of others (like John von Neumann and Werner Heisenberg), and his philosophy incorrectly portrayed as antirealist — suggesting that only observations brought reality into existence. Bohr never said any such thing, and in fact cautioned against using language so loosely.</p>



<p>Perović’s account offers a thorough survey of other historical investigations into Bohr’s work and draws liberally from Bohr’s own writings. It’s a nuanced and insightful presentation of the interplay of experiment and theory in the scientific process. This book is not easy reading, though. It’s not the place to seek clear explanations of quantum physics and Bohr’s interpretation of it. Perović opts for scholarly thoroughness and careful reasoning with a propensity for long sentences. But then again, Bohr’s writings were no breeze, either. In fact, a major complaint against Bohr has been expressed by authors who say his writings are very difficult to understand. It’s unfortunate that so many seem to think that because they can’t understand Bohr, he must have been wrong. Perović’s book provides a useful antidote to that attitude. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/preterm-birth-chewing-gum-sugar-free-oral-health-malawi">Chewing sugar-free gum reduced preterm births in a large study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chewing a sugar-free gum daily reduced preterm births in a large study in Malawi. The oral intervention was inspired by past research linking poor oral health and preterm birth. The gum contains xylitol — a chemical that can boost oral health — in place of regular sugar.</p>



<p>Among women who chewed the xylitol gum, <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)02658-2/fulltext">549 out of 4,349 pregnancies, or 12.6 percent, were preterm</a>, researchers reported February 3 at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s Annual Pregnancy Meeting. That’s a 24 percent reduction compared with the group who didn’t receive the gum. Among those women, 878 out of 5,321 pregnancies, or 16.5 percent, of the babies were born before 37 weeks.</p>



<p>The oral health of gum users also improved. About 4,000 of the women had an initial dental exam and a later checkup. The women who chewed the gum had less periodontal disease, a condition in which the tissue surrounding the teeth becomes infected and inflamed, compared with those who didn’t get the chewing gum.</p>



<p>“The findings are very encouraging,” says Kim Boggess, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill who was not involved with the study. The researchers “are approaching a very complex problem in a low-resource area by trying to use a low-tech, easily applicable intervention.” It would take more research to see if this could work in other settings, she says.</p>





<p>For the new study, researchers enrolled around 10,000 women across eight health centers in the greater Lilongwe area of Malawi before they were pregnant or in early pregnancy. All of the women received tailored information on pregnancy, preventing preterm birth and improving oral health from community health workers. Roughly half of the women also received the gum.</p>



<p>The study was part of a decade-long project in the region surrounding Lilongwe, which has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062552/">a preterm birth rate estimated at 19.3 percent</a>, one of the highest globally. First, the research team talked with community members to learn what problems related to pregnancy the community was concerned about and wanted to solve.</p>



<p>In the Chichewa language spoken in Malawi, preterm birth is <em>kuchila masika asankwane</em>, which means “born too soon.” In focus groups conducted early in the project, “all participants knew of many women who had suffered ‘born too soon,’” says team member Kjersti Aagaard, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. Babies born prematurely can have complications that impair their lungs, neurodevelopment and more, with long-term health risks, and they are more likely to die in their first year of life than babies born to term.</p>



<p>Along with learning about <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-123">the community’s perceptions of preterm birth</a>, researchers also assessed <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0039-1695003#JR190038-21">the rate of cavities and gum disease</a> among pregnant and postpartum women, which was in the 70 percent range. And they asked the community if chewing xylitol gum was “something that would be palatable — both truly palatable as well as acceptable,” Aagaard says.</p>



<p>Studies finding a <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(14)62726-4/fulltext">link between periodontal disease and preterm birth</a> go back a couple of decades. The inflammatory disease has also been associated with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gum-disease-opens-body-host-infections">atherosclerosis and other ailments</a> (<em>SN: 4/6/16</em>). The diversity and size of the microbial community in the mouth is second only to the gut. With periodontal disease, there is a shift in the composition of that oral microbial community, giving way to bacteria that cause inflammation and damage gum tissue. From there, the bacteria may enter the bloodstream to reach other organs, perhaps including the placenta.</p>



<p>Chewing xylitol gum appears to be a check on that shift in the oral microbial community. Previous studies have shown that chewing <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00784-017-2075-5">xylitol gum leads to fewer cavities</a> and suggest it <a href="https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1902/jop.2014.130455">can reduce inflammation</a>. Aagaard and her colleagues are planning more research on what’s going on at the microbial level to understand how better oral health reduces preterm birth.</p>



<p>The team also wants to track the neurodevelopment of the children born early and those born on time in the study. “No matter how cost-effective an intervention may be, we still want to make sure you’re making a difference in somebody’s life,” Aagaard says, “and the ultimate outcome is how do those kiddos do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/15/understanding-bad-character-research-into-the-dark-triad-digested/">Understanding bad character: Research into the Dark Triad, digested</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Twenty years ago, two Canadian psychologists published a paper that instantly captured the imagination of researchers — and reporters. Del Paulhus and Kevin Williams <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-11565-008">argued that a &#8220;Dark Triad&#8221; of &#8220;overlapping but distinct&#8221; toxic traits</a> — subclinical psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism — explained much of what we might otherwise call a &#8220;bad&#8221; character. Research into the Dark Triad shows no signs of slowing. But the concept is being challenged. And other psychologists are proposing different ways to get to grips with the darker side of human nature…</p>



<span id="more-45374"></span>



<p><strong>What exactly is the Dark Triad?</strong></p>



<p>Paulhus and Williams focused on people who fell within the normal range of functioning. So, not diagnosed clinical psychopaths in jail for murder, say, but the kind of person you might find yourself sharing an office with; or, worse, a home. The three Dark Triad traits cover a range of anti-social beliefs and behaviours:</p>



<p>Psychopathy is associated with low levels of empathy, and being high in impulsivity and thrill-seeking.</p>



<p>Machiavellianism was named, in 1970, after the philosophy of Niccolo Machiavelli; people who score highly on this scale are cynical and unprincipled manipulators of others.</p>



<p>Narcissists are entitled types who believe that they are superior beings, and should be treated that way.</p>



<p>Paulhus and Williams argued that each of the Dark Triad traits has its own psychological profile, but they share a common core of &#8220;callous-manipulation&#8221; — a disregard for the feelings and wellbeing of others, for personal gain. Dark Triad scales have now been used in literally hundreds of studies, with plenty of headline-grabbing findings.</p>



<p><strong>Dark traits = more attractive dates?</strong></p>



<p>This surprising conclusion from a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/per.2040">2016 speed-dating study</a> garnered global coverage. Both men and women who scored highly for narcissism <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/29/how-do-people-with-dark-triad-personality-traits-fare-at-speed-dating/">were rated as being more attractive prospects for both short- and long-term relationships</a>. Also, women&nbsp;— but not men — who scored higher for psychopathy received better ratings from their dates.</p>



<p>However, as the <em>Digest </em>also reported, participants’ ratings actually seemed to be influenced by other factors that were merely associated with dark traits: women who scored highly for psychopathy and narcissism were also considered to be more attractive, and male narcissists were more appealingly extraverted. Once the researchers controlled for the influence of attraction and extraversion, it didn’t matter how narcissistic a potential date was. </p>



<p>Researchers have also recently disputed suggestions that scoring highly on dark traits might bring some other benefits, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167217733080">such as hedge fund success</a>. In fact, unsurprisingly, most links between the Dark Triad and functioning in society have been distinctly less positive…</p>



<p><strong>Faking and ghosting</strong></p>



<p>Dark Triad traits have been linked to everything from faking in job interviews and exploitation of colleagues (a 2018 review in the <em>Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behaviour</em> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321115270_The_Dark_Triad_and_Workplace_Behavior">summed up research on workplace behaviour</a>) to criminal behaviour, and ghosting. A 2020 study of students in Spain, for example, found that two combinations of Dark Triad traits (being Machiavellian and narcissistic or Machiavellian and psychopathic) best predicted risky behaviours, such as getting into a fight or gambling. And a 2021 study of American adults also found that those who’d scored higher on a Dark Triad scale were <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/17/ghosting-is-more-acceptable-to-people-with-dark-triad-traits/">more likely to find it acceptable to ghost someone</a> — to end a relationship by abruptly ceasing communication.</p>



<p><strong>Challenges to the Triad</strong></p>



<p>Though hugely popular, the concept of the Dark Triad has been challenged. In 2019, Joshua Miller at the University of Georgia, US, and colleagues published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419838233">a review of work in the field</a> in <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>. “Unfortunately, several limitations to this research are unrecognised or ignored,” they wrote. They argue that one of the biggest is an oversimplification of personality traits in the scales that are used. A study might identify someone as being &#8220;narcissistic&#8221;, say, simply on the basis of a high self-esteem score, when narcissism itself is more complicated (and &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; narcissism is linked to low self-esteem). Neither is there a single disorder of &#8220;psychopathy&#8221;, argue other researchers, but rather a spectrum of psychopathic disorders, influenced by various factors, including brain structure, early life experience and genes. This would imply that a single &#8220;psychopathy&#8221; label within the Dark Triad isn’t appropriate.</p>



<p>However, for others, the issue isn’t so much the rigour and quality of Dark Triad research, but whether a triad is enough….</p>



<p><strong>Should it be a &#8220;Dark Tetrad&#8221; — or more?</strong></p>



<p>Various other dark traits have been put forward as equals to those in the triad. Sadism — getting pleasure from inflicting physical or emotional pain on others — has perhaps the biggest backing.</p>



<p>The <em>Digest </em>has covered all kinds of research on sadism, including a 2021 study finding that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/12/people-behave-more-sadistically-when-theyre-bored/">boredom can drive even people who are low in trait sadism to punish others</a>, just for the minor thrill. Sadism proponents (from an academic perspective…) argue that <a href="https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001/a000179">it has a unique profile, while also being an expression of the &#8220;Dark Tetrad&#8221;.</a> Some psychologists meanwhile<a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/a0036039"> argue that &#8220;spite&#8221;</a> (hurting an opponent even when there is a cost to yourself) should also be considered alongside psychopathy and the rest. But yet others see our dark sides differently again…</p>



<p><strong>The &#8220;D factor&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>“Over the years, more and more allegedly distinct and increasingly narrow aversive traits have been introduced, resulting in a plethora of constructs lacking theoretical integration”. So argue three psychologists <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/rev0000111">who in 2018 published a popular paper in <em>Psychological Review</em> </a>arguing for a core general &#8220;<a href="https://www.darkfactor.org">D-factor</a>&#8221; (Dark factor) of personality. In this model, 9 related dark traits fall within D, which in essence is this: a motivation ruthlessly to put your own interests above other people’s, and to behave accordingly, even when it causes harm to others or even to yourself. This does sound rather like &#8220;callous-manipulation&#8221; plus spite. Anyway, the nine are: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, sadism and spitefulness plus Moral disengagement (being able to behave unethically without feeling bad), Psychological entitlement (believing you deserve more and are better than others), Self-interest (a desire to boost your own social or financial status) and Egoism (being concerned with your own goals and achievements at the expense of others’). </p>



<p>So, 20 years on from the explosive emergence of the Dark Triad concept, where are we, in terms of really understanding &#8220;bad&#8221; character? The answer, it seems, is all over the place. Is the Dark &#8220;Triad&#8221; enough? Are Dark Triad scales useful for screening potential employees, say? Do we really need &#8220;psychological entitlement&#8221; plus narcissism, in a round-up of dark traits? All these questions, and many more, are still hotly debated. But one thing is for sure: scholarly and public fascination with the darker sides of human nature show no sign whatsoever of abating. So we can expect lots more &#8220;dark&#8221; research and stories to come.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Word puzzles are <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-wordle-craze-why-do-we-love-puzzles-and-are-they-good-for-our-brains-175227">all the rage</a> right now. But if you’ve already done today’s Wordle, here are some anagrams to keep you going until tomorrow:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Reality is only a matter of</em>&#8230;..   <strong><em>tvesrecipep</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Free will is a powerful</em>&#8230;.. <em> <strong>oinliusl</strong></em></p>



<p>If you managed to solve the anagrams at the end of these statements, you may have experienced a “Eureka” or “Aha!” moment, in which the solution suddenly seemed to appear, perhaps accompanied by a sense of happiness or relief. And if you did, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05923-3">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, you’d be more likely to believe that the statement itself is true.</p>



<span id="more-45359"></span>



<p>We’ve all experienced Aha! moments in our daily lives. They often seem to come out of nowhere after we’ve been stumped by a problem for a while, perhaps while we’re doing something else like having a shower. And generally, an Aha! moment is more likely to occur if we’ve arrived at the correct solution to a problem than if we’ve reached an incorrect one.</p>



<p>In fact, <em>because</em> they are normally associated with finding the right solution, when we experience Aha! moments we get a gut feeling that what we’ve come up with is correct or true. But a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/05/eureka-moments-have-a-dark-side-they-can-make-false-facts-seem-true/">2019 study</a> by Ruben Laukkonen at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and colleagues found that this intuitive response has a dark side: experiencing Aha! moments while reading false statements can make these statements seem true.</p>



<p>In their new paper, the same group explored whether Aha! moments can also influence how much people endorse particular worldviews. They asked participants to read 15 statements, like those above. For half of the participants, the final word of each statement was scrambled and they had to try and solve it within 15 seconds. The other half just read the statement in full, with no anagram (e.g. “Free will is a powerful illusion”, if you are still scratching your head about that one).</p>



<p>All participants then rated how true they thought the statement was on a 12-point scale. Those in the anagram condition also indicated whether or not they had experienced an Aha! moment while unscrambling the word.</p>



<p>Overall, participants in the anagram condition rated the statements as more true than those who saw the statements with no anagram. Furthermore, in trials where they successfully solved an anagram, they rated the statement as more true than on trials where they weren’t successful.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the crucial finding: participants in the anagram condition also rated the statement as more true if they had experienced an Aha! moment than if they had not, and this effect held even when the researchers looked only at trials where the participants had successfully solved the anagram. In other words, Aha! moments seemed to give a “ring of truth” to these worldview statements, above and beyond any effect that might have been caused by successfully solving the anagram. A replication study found exactly the same result.</p>



<p>In a second study, the team showed that the timing of the Aha! moment mattered. When participants completed an anagram in isolation (e.g. “oinliusl”), and then saw the full statement 10 seconds later, their truth ratings were not affected by whether or not they had experienced an Aha! moment. That is, Aha! moments only made worldview statements seem more true when they occurred at the same time as reading the statement.  </p>



<p>The research suggests that Aha! moments can influence fairly fundamental beliefs about the way the world works. “Because aha experiences tend to be a marker of good ideas, it makes sense that humans learn to draw on this feeling as a source of information about our beliefs,” the authors conclude. Unfortunately, this mental short-cut doesn’t always work as intended.</p>



<p>Of course, completing an anagram at the end of a statement is a fairly artificial scenario. But the authors do hint at how a similar process might play out in the real world, pointing to the example of conspiracy theories and specifically QAnon. Followers who have been told that there is a cabal of satanic pedophiles in the upper echelons of government might experience an Aha! moment upon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">discovering a “secret code” in leaked emails that supposedly supports this theory</a>, making those outlandish claims seem more true. More work is clearly needed to understand how the &#8220;dark side&#8221; of Aha! moments can influence our real-life beliefs and behaviour — and what can be done to prevent any harmful effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-jupiter-orbit-sun-close-gravity-star-planet">How ‘hot Jupiters’ may get their weirdly tight orbits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Strange giant planets known as hot Jupiters, which orbit close to their suns, got kicked onto their peculiar paths by nearby planets and stars, a new study finds.</p>



<p>After analyzing the orbits of dozens of hot Jupiters, a team of astronomers found a way to catch giant planets in the process of getting uncomfortably close to their stars. The new analysis, submitted January 27 to arXiv.org, pins the blame for the weird worlds <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11768">on gravitational kicks from other massive objects orbiting the same star</a>, many of which destroyed themselves in the process.</p>



<p>“It’s a pretty dramatic way to create your hot Jupiters,” says Malena Rice, an astrophysicist at Yale University.</p>



<p>Hot Jupiters have long been mysterious. They orbit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scalding-hot-gas-giant-breaks-heat-records">very close to their stars</a>, whirling around in a few days or less, whereas all the giant planets in our solar system lie at vast distances from the sun (<em>SN: 6/5/17</em>). To <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">explain the odd planets</a>, astronomers have proposed three main ideas (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>). Perhaps the hot Jupiters formed next to their stars and stayed put, or maybe they started off farther out and then slowly spiraled inward. In either case, the planets should have circular orbits aligned with their stars’ equators, because the worlds inherited their paths from material in the protoplanetary disks that gave them birth.</p>





<p>The new study, though, favors the third idea: Gravitational interactions with another giant planet or a companion star first hurl a Jupiter-sized planet onto a highly elliptical and inclined orbit that brings it close to its star. In some cases, the planet even revolves the wrong way around its star, opposite the way it spins.</p>



<p>In this scenario, every time the tossed planet sweeps past its sun, the star’s gravity robs the planet of orbital energy. This shrinks the orbit, gradually making it more circular and less inclined, until the planet becomes a hot Jupiter on a small, circular orbit, realigned to be in the same plane as the star’s equator.</p>



<p>Stars usually circularize a planet’s orbit before they realign it, and cool stars realign an orbit faster than warm stars do. So Rice and her colleagues looked for relationships between the shapes and tilts of the orbits of several dozen hot Jupiters that go around stars of different temperatures.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, the team found that the hot Jupiters around cool stars tend to be on well-aligned, circular orbits, whereas the hot Jupiters around warm stars are often on orbits that are elongated and off-kilter. Put another way, many of the orbits around warm stars haven’t yet had time to settle down into their final size and orientation. These orbits still bear the marks of having been shaped by gravitational run-ins with neighboring bodies in the system, the team concludes.</p>



<p>It’s a “simple, elegant argument,” says David Martin, an astrophysicist at Ohio State University in Columbus who was not involved with this study. “They’re presenting the evidence in a new way that helps strengthen” the idea that other massive objects in the same solar system produce hot Jupiters. He suspects this theory probably explains the majority of these planets.</p>



<p>But it means that innumerable giant worlds have suffered terrible fates. Some of the planets that hurled their brethren close to their stars ended up plunging into those same stars themselves, Rice says. And many other planets got ejected from their solar systems altogether, so today these wayward worlds wander the deep freeze of interstellar space, far from the light of any sun.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/freshwater-ice-melt-water-temperature-scallops-spikes">Freshwater ice can melt into scallops and spikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Water’s wacky density leads to strange effects that researchers are still uncovering.</p>



<p>Typically, liquids become denser the more they cool. But freshwater is densest at 4° Celsius. As it cools below that temperature, the water becomes less dense and rises. As a result, ice columns submerged in liquid water <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.044502">can melt into three different shapes</a>, depending on the water’s temperature, researchers report in the Jan. 28 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost everything” about the findings was surprising, says mathematician Leif Ristroph of New York University.</p>



<p>Ristroph and colleagues anchored ultrapure ice cylinders up to 30 centimeters long in place and submerged them in tanks of water at temperatures from 2° to 10° C.</p>





<p>The ice melted into smooth, downward-pointing spikes if placed in water lower than about 5° C. Simulations showed “a strange thing — that the cold liquid water near the ice is actually buoyant” due to being less dense than the rest of the water in the tank, Ristroph says. So that upward flow draws warmer water closer to the ice’s base, causing it to melt faster than the top. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The opposite occurred above about 7° C; the ice formed an upward-pointing spike. That’s because colder water near the ice is denser than the surrounding water and sinks, pulling in warmer water at the top of the ice and causing it to melt faster than the bottom, simulations showed. This matches “what your intuition would expect,” Ristroph says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between about 5° to 7° C, the ice melted into scalloped columns. “Basically, the water is confused,” Ristroph says, so it forms different layers, some of which tend to rise and others which tend to sink, depending on their density. Ultimately, the water organizes into “swirls or vortices of fluid that carve the weird ripples into the ice.”</p>



<p>More work is needed to understand the complex interplay of factors that may generate these and other shapes on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">ice melting in nature</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>)<em>.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-surface-photo-parker-solar-probe-space-nasa">These are the first visible-light images of Venus’ surface captured from space</a></h4>

              
                <p>By serendipity, scientists have photographed Venus’ surface from space for the first time.</p>



<p>Though the planet’s rocky body is concealed beneath a thick veil of clouds, telescopes aboard NASA’s Parker Solar Probe managed to capture the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096302">first visible-light images of the surface taken from space</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve never actually seen the surface through the clouds at these wavelengths before,” said Lori Glaze, Director of NASA&#8217;s Planetary Science Division, on February 10 during a live broadcast on Twitter.</p>



<p>Though the Parker Solar Probe was built to study the sun, it must make regular flybys of Venus. The planet’s gravity tugs on the probe, tightening its orbit and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">bringing it closer to the sun</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Those assists from Venus helped the spacecraft make headlines when it became the first probe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">to enter the sun’s atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>The Parker Solar Probe travels around the sun in a highly elliptical orbit, as illustrated in this video. To tighten its loops and bring it nearer to the blazing star, the probe slows itself down by flying near Venus, using the planet’s gravity as a brake.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was during two such flybys in July 2020 and February 2021 that the probe’s WISPR telescopes captured the new images. While WISPR found Venus’ dayside too bright to image, it was able to discern large-scale surface features, such as the vast highland region called Aphrodite Terra, through the clouds on the nightside.</p>





<p>Clouds tend to scatter and absorb light. But some wavelengths of light get through, depending on the clouds’ chemical makeup, says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Though scientists knew such spectral windows exist in Venus’ thick clouds of sulfuric acid, the researchers didn’t expect light visible to human eyes would break through so intensely. And while WISPR was designed to study the sun’s atmosphere, its construction also happens to allow it to detect this unanticipated window of light in Venus’ clouds. “It’s fortuitous that they happened to have an instrument that could see through the clouds,” Byrne says.</p>

<p>The photographs show a planet so hot that it glows, much like red-hot iron, said Brian Wood, an astrophysicist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and a coauthor of the paper, during the social media event.</p>



<p>“The pattern of bright and dark that you see is basically a temperature map,” he said — brighter regions are hotter and darker regions are cooler. This pattern correlates well with topographic maps previously produced from radar and infrared surveys. Highlands appear dark and lowlands appear bright, Wood said.</p>



<p>The images come as NASA prepares to launch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two missions</a> to Venus (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). The new photographs, Wood said, “may help in the interpretation of the observations taken in the future from these new missions.”</p>

<p>Venus’ perpetually cloud-shrouded surface remains penetrable only by radio waves. A planetary radar group now reports results of an extended series of radar measurements of the topography of Venus that for the first time provides a view of surface height variations around the entire circumference of the planet.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p><br>Those observations were taken by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, which was the most powerful radar system for mapping rocky bodies in outer space until its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-astronomy-discoveries">sudden collapse</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 12/19/20&nbsp;&amp; 1/2/21, p.&nbsp;8</em>). The observatory also revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radar-image-venus-hints-tectonism/">ancient lava flows</a> on Venus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/icy-clues-gleaned-mercurys-other-half">ice on Mercury</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/18/76, p.&nbsp;181</em>; <em>SN: 11/9/91, p.&nbsp;295</em>). Arecibo’s maps of Mars and the asteroid Bennu helped NASA plan the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-landing-message-puerto-rico">Viking</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx missions</a>. Some other facilities have planetary radar systems, but they are not as powerful as Arecibo’s was. Astronomers are adding a radar transmitter to West&nbsp;Virginia’s Green Bank Telescope that is expected to rival or exceed Arecibo’s.</p>

The answer might reveal more than you think: according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211063260">new research</a>, people who perceive themselves as being <em>more</em> similar to other animals are more likely to care about being creative, and to engage with the arts. Why? It’s all to do with how we manage death anxiety, argue Uri Lifshin at Reichman University, Israel, and colleagues, in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>.</p>



<span id="more-45348"></span>



<p>We all know that at some point, sooner or later, we are going to die. It’s not exactly an uplifting thought. According to Terror Management Theory, to assuage death anxiety, we created cultural belief systems that allow us to see ourselves as more than mortal animals. Belief in an afterlife and a strong identification with one’s national culture are two such systems. But there are also other ways to get a sense of immortality: by becoming famous, say, or via creative pursuits, which might leave a lasting mark.</p>



<p>To explore individual differences in feeling that people are more than mortal animals, the team used a four-item &#8220;perceived similarity of the self to animals&#8221; (PSSA) scale. (Participants had to rate &#8220;how similar you think you are to other animals&#8221;, for example.) And in an initial study on almost 900 American students, they found a correlation between higher PSSA scores and scores on other measures, including being less invested in national identity and feeling that &#8220;being creative&#8221; was important. Another study on a broader range of American adults found a link between higher PSSA scores and greater engagement with and enjoyment of the arts.</p>



<p>In a subsequent online experiment on 189 Jewish Israeli participants, one group was asked to reflect on their own death, while a control group was asked to think about experiences of physical pain instead. The researchers found that among those with relatively high PSSA scores, those who got the death reminder reported caring more about being creative (about &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221;, for example) than those in the control group. They interpret this as supporting the idea that people who think they are more similar to other animals are more motivated to use creativity as a way to manage their death anxiety. I have to note, though, that within the control group, people with low PSSA scores actually reported caring more about creativity than those with higher PSSA scores — contrary to the team’s expectations. And indeed, other results from some further studies were mixed, too. </p>



<p>The researchers maintain that data from their total of six studies support the idea that seeing ourselves as similar to other animals is directly linked with death anxiety and the pursuit of creativity. This link can’t be explained by other variables including religiosity, personality factors, belief in human evolution and political orientation.</p>



<p>However, statistical trends and marginally significant results do feature pretty heavily in their paper. And in one study, people with higher PSSA scores also scored higher on the personality trait of Openness. <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kaufman-2013.pdf">More open people are more interested in the arts (among other things), more creative and less conventional</a> — so less likely to adopt a nationalistic or religious belief system. Are high PSSA scores just tapping into Openness, then?</p>



<p>The team thinks that people’s perceived similarity to animals is important in and of itself. “Our findings suggest that PSSA may be an important factor in understanding investment in creativity,” they write. But while it’s an interesting idea, it’s also one that certainly needs more work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-sickle-cell-disease-esrick-genetics">Gene therapies for sickle cell disease come with hope and challenges</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today, it’s clear that our genes not only cause many diseases, but also hold potential cures. But that wasn’t always the case. It wasn’t until 1949 that scientists first found the molecular culprit of a disease — its roots in the genetic code. The disease was the blood disorder known as sickle cell disease, an inherited disorder that causes severe and debilitating pain. Now, nearly 75 years later, researchers are developing gene therapies to cure it.</p>



<p>Sickle cell disease results from<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-1044"> a change in a key protein in hemoglobin</a>, which helps transport oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin normally allows “red blood cells to be very floppy and pliable, and slip and slide through the blood vessels easily,” says pediatrician Erica Esrick. But a mutation in a single gene, the <em>HBB </em>gene, makes hemoglobin stack in long strings inside blood cells, giving them an inflexible, sickle shape. Instead of being “squishy,” the stiff red blood cells get stuck inside blood vessels, blocking blood flow.</p>



<p>Sickle cell affects millions of people around the world, particularly those whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html">approximately 100,000 people live with the disease</a>, most of them Black or Latino. People with sickle cell disease have a shortened life expectancy, living only into their late 40s on average, in large part due to strokes or organ damage from blocked blood vessels. Esrick, of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and others are trying to fight the disease through gene therapy.</p>

<p>Gene therapies seek to manipulate the very information of life by replacing, inactivating or fixing missing or broken genes — and so curing patients. But the journey to today’s handful of approved gene therapies, including for diseases like severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or SCID, certain blood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-t-cell-gene-therapy-top-science-stories-2017-yir">cancers</a> and spinal muscular atrophy, has been rocky. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-human-gene-therapy-test-begun">Early clinical trials</a> in the 1990s weren’t effective, and the 2000s brought unintended and sometimes deadly consequences, including a leukemia-like illness.</p>



<p>Despite gene therapy’s challenges, many researchers believe sickle cell is a good target because the molecular pathways are well understood and straightforward. What’s more, every copy of the gene doesn’t need to be mended to have an effect. (Individuals who inherit the mutated gene from only one parent, for example, don’t develop sickle cell disease.)</p>



<p>Esrick is co-leading a clinical trial testing a gene therapy that attempts to encourage the body to make more of a healthy type of hemoglobin produced by fetuses and young babies — but not adults — called fetal hemoglobin. DNA for making a short string of genetic material called a microRNA is delivered by a virus into cells from a patient’s bone marrow. The virus, called a vector, permanently inserts the DNA into the cell’s genetic blueprint. The microRNA then interferes with the production of a protein that prevents fetal hemoglobin from being made. Once that protein is blocked, fetal hemoglobin production turns back on. Like turning on a faucet, a steady stream of the healthy hemoglobin can flow into the bloodstream, making up for the faulty form.</p>



<p>Preliminary data released in January 2021 showed that the treatment helped <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2029392?url_ver=Z39.88-2003">six sickle cell patients make fetal hemoglobin</a>, Esrick and colleagues reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. During the follow-up period, ranging from several months to more than two years, the patients’ symptoms were reduced or eliminated. The team has expanded the trial to include more patients and further test the treatment.</p>

<p>Scientists are testing other ways to tackle sickle cell via gene therapy, too. A biotechnology company called bluebird bio is testing an approach that delivers a functional copy of the <em>HBB </em>gene to patients. Another team is preparing to begin a trial that will edit that gene directly using CRISPR/Cas9.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> staff writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-garcia-de-jesus">Erin Garcia de Jesús</a> spoke with Esrick about the ongoing fetal hemoglobin clinical trial, including the hurdles and the hope. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What tools do we currently have to treat sickle cell?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: The only curative treatment is a bone marrow transplant. The bone marrow is like the factory for the blood cells. If you can get bone marrow from somebody who doesn’t have sickle cell disease, then you can grow your own healthy red blood cells that don’t sickle. But that is a major procedure, and it’s really only standard if you have what’s called a matched sibling [a brother or sister without sickle cell whose key white blood cell proteins match yours].</p>



<p>Less than 20 percent of people with sickle cell have a matched sibling available. If a matched sibling is available, then that’s a really good potential treatment option, but it is still a risky procedure. It comes along with some up-front risk of mortality and a lot of potential side effects, such as graft-versus-host disease and a higher risk of infection because of immunosuppressive drugs.</p>



<p>Then there are medications to treat sickle cell. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/drug-wards-sickle-cell-attacks">most well-established and long-lasting is called hydroxyurea</a>. It increases fetal hemoglobin. In many people, it increases the fetal hemoglobin by a lot; that&#8217;s why it works so well. It’s been available since the ’90s, and has been moving gradually to younger and younger ages.</p>



<p>Now it is a very clear recommendation that essentially every child with sickle cell should be on it. But not everyone has access to specialized hematology care, and it’s a medication that has to be taken daily. Some people have adverse effects and can’t take it. It also doesn’t work for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: How many people are in your team’s trial and what results have you seen so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Nine patients have been treated. We anticipate the 10th patient will be treated soon. The preliminary data from the first six patients was published about a year ago. Additional data from subsequent patients has been largely quite similar — except for one patient whose fetal hemoglobin response was unfortunately not as robust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What is the process like for the trial participants?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Patients have to get their cells collected [the cells live in the bone marrow and give rise to blood cells], which takes a three-day hospital admission and sometimes has to be repeated a few times. It&#8217;s through IV, basically. Then the cells get taken off to the lab.</p>



<p>When we get word from the lab, “OK, we have a good product” [meaning the virus got the DNA into enough cells], then the patient comes back and is admitted to the hospital for a month or so. It&#8217;s a long and arduous hospital admission because they need to receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>The reason they need chemotherapy is because the bone marrow cells that haven&#8217;t been collected need to get nearly wiped out in order to give the advantage to the cells that are being given back [also through IV] to set up shop and produce.</p>



<p>Chemotherapy comes with a lot of the side effects and risks associated with gene therapy, including acute short-term risks like hearing loss and nausea. And it also comes with some of the long-term risks, including infertility and a risk of blood cancers.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Why choose gene therapy over a bone marrow transplant if both require chemotherapy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: With gene therapy, there&#8217;s no issue with immunosuppression, because it&#8217;s your own cells. People who get a transplant from another person have to be on immunosuppressive medications for a period of months after the transplant. There&#8217;s a risk of graft rejection because of the mismatch between the donor and the recipient.</p>



<p>The other risk in a bone marrow transplant from another person is graft-versus-host disease, where the graft and donated cells reject the recipient. That can cause severe disease. With gene therapy, that&#8217;s not a risk at all.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Last year, a clinical trial run by a company called bluebird bio announced that a trial participant developed leukemia. Cancer is obviously a huge concern and has thwarted previous gene therapy trials. What do we know so far about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: This was, of course, of major concern to the field. It was actually the second case of leukemia in that trial. The first one was published a couple of years ago as a case report.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s ever a case of leukemia or any preleukemia in a gene therapy trial, we always ask: Was it caused because the vector stuck a gene into a spot that was dangerous?</p>



<p>It does not look like that&#8217;s the case. In the first patient in the bluebird bio trial who developed leukemia, the leukemia cells didn&#8217;t even have the transferred gene in them. So, the thought was that was probably just an example of chemotherapy causing leukemia, which we know can happen in a small percent of people who receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>But the second case, in February 2021, really raised a red flag. Why is that happening two times in a trial of only 40-something patients? It&#8217;s still not exactly clear. There are some studies that suggest that people with sickle cell disease may have an increased risk of leukemia. But the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] placed the bluebird bio trial on hold while some investigations were done. When it became pretty clear that it wasn&#8217;t directly related to the vector, the trial was allowed to reopen.</p>



<p>Our trial, which has many similarities to the bluebird bio trial, was not put on hold by the FDA but was put on hold by our funder, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute while they looked at the data. That hold was recently lifted.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Have there been any cases of leukemia in your team’s trial?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Fortunately, no.</p>



<p>But you know when anything like that happens in the field, it&#8217;s a big deal. I called all of the patients who we had treated in our trial to let them know. [The bluebird bio cases] happened in patients who had been treated three and five years prior. The longest-treated patient in our trial was almost three and a half years ago, and the most recently treated was about eight or nine months ago. I hope we see no concerning signs for any new development like that, but it&#8217;s too early to say.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What are some of the biggest challenges that sickle cell has had to overcome?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: For the longest time, there were no new therapies at all. These technologies took a long time because they are based on basic science discoveries that were being worked on. But also, the patient population with sickle cell is a population that has historically been underserved and without a lot of power.</p>



<p>In the United States, it’s primarily Black and Latino patients, and across the board those populations have suffered from health inequality. I think that if there were a disease that caused this degree of morbidity and mortality and pain in other parts of the population, it may have been speedier.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What gives you hope? What do you find exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: I find myself bending over backwards to make sure that I’m not coming across as, “We have a cure!” But that said, it is really exciting that this is a treatment that is theoretically possible for everyone without needing to find a [bone marrow] match. That’s a huge difference from classic bone marrow transplants.</p>



<p>The speed at which new [gene therapy] treatments are being developed is amazing. I think the horizon is very bright in terms of one or maybe many of these therapies being really effective and safe. I’ve talked to so many patients and families who have reached out interested in our trial or other trials. There’s such a huge unmet need. The fact that there are a lot of these new treatments that are being developed is an encouragement to these families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">Public peer review files</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peer-review is probably the most obscure part of the publication of scientific results. In this blog post, I would like to make the point that the best way to learn about it &#8211; except by being directly involved &#8211; is to read public peer review files. In addition, I will recommend some interesting or surprising peer review files, mostly for systems neuroscience, but also for some optics papers.</p>



<p><strong>Public peer review files should be the standard</strong></p>



<p>Peer review takes place before official &#8220;publication&#8221; in a peer-reviewed journal and is therefore usually not accessible to the reader. During the last years, this practice has changed, and more and more journals are now offering the peer review and rebuttal letters as supplementary files. This is done for example by the journal eLife, but also Nature Communications, sometimes for the SfN journals, and Nature. For some journals, like Nature, the authors can opt out of the peer review file publication (<a href="https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-transparent-peer-review.pdf">here is Nature&#8217;s policy</a>). But, honestly, if you are not willing to share the reviews publicly, what do you want to hide? I think it should become a mandatory standard to share the reviews, with only specific reasons justifying an opt-out. (Update 2022-02-14: a <a href="https://twitter.com/ElDuvelle/status/1492932211410153475">Twitter-discussion on this topic</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>What to learn from peer review files</strong></p>



<p>As a young researcher like a PhD student, it is rare to be involved in the review process, which, therefore, remains a black box. For me, it was fascinating to read my first peer review files on eLife maybe 5 years ago. It felt like the entire smooth surface of this paper started to crumble and give way to a more rich and more nuanced point of view. Looking back at this paper, this nuanced view was also somewhat included in the paper, but in such a smooth manner that it was difficult to extract without absolute expert knowledge.</p>



<p>Nowadays, I rarely read eLife papers until also the peer review section is online (which comes a couple days after the preliminary pdf). The reviewer comments provide an additional point of view that is very helpful in particular when I cannot fully judge the paper myself.</p>



<p>Additionally, reading such review files helps to write both better manuscripts, better rebuttal letters, and also better reviews. Also, gaining experience from these files prepares a bit for the sometimes very difficult experiences when receiving the reviews. Plus, reading those reviews makes the entire process a bit more transparent. When I wrote my first reviews for journals, I had seen only three or four reviews for my own co-author papers; but I had seen many more as public review files.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look into some examples that show what can happen during peer review. Paper links are in the title, links to the review files/sections thereafter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7"><strong>Toroidal topology of grid cell acti</strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7">vity</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-04268-7/MediaObjects/41586_2021_4268_MOESM4_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432776v1">preprint</a> of this paper by Gardner et al. from the Moser lab appeared, I put it on my reading list, but never actually read it fully because I did not feel on top of the vast literature about continuous attractor models, and I did not even know whether a &#8220;toroidal&#8221; geometry of the activity space would be a surprising result or not.</p>



<p>Checking the peer review files after publication at Nature provided exactly this entry point that I had been missing before. In retrospect, all the information needed is also in the paper, but the more direct and less formal language in the reviews took me by the hand and showed me directly what the paper is about. The summaries at the beginning of each review provide a very useful second perspective on the main messages of the paper.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04223-6">Deep physical neural networks</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-04223-6/MediaObjects/41586_2021_4223_MOESM2_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed an interesting article published at Nature on &#8220;deep physical neural networks&#8221;. I checked the author&#8217;s <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LoganGWright1/status/1488885395827871747">Twitter thread</a> on the paper and found the topic intriguing, but slightly beyond my area of expertise. The review file provided me exactly with the lacking context and critical external opinion that I needed to form a somewhat less vague opinion of the specific advance made by the paper. Really helpful!</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04404-x">Place cells respond to moving bars in immobile rats</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-022-04404-x/MediaObjects/41586_2022_4404_MOESM2_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>This review file contains an entire story by itself. In the first round of review, reviewer #1 was rather critical, while the other two reviewers were almost convinced already. The authors, in a 8-month revision period finally managed to very decently address most points brought up by the reviewers. They do this, as has become apparently common practice for rebuttal letters to high-impact journals, in a very long and detailed letter (the entire review file is 44 pages).</p>



<p>But after this round of reviews and rebuttals, suddenly, reviewer #3 changes his/her opinion entirely:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Unfortunately my evaluation of this paper has changed since the first submission due to comments from the other reviewers and because of literature I have discovered since then. This paper presents a set of reasonably well performed and analyzed experiments, but I no longer think the main results are novel or surprising. I therefore do not recommend publication in Nature and think this paper is better suited for a specialist journal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>This is just the beginning of a long comment on why the reviewer thinks the paper is not novel enough any more. This is of course a nightmare for the authors. In the end, the authors do their best to address these concerns of novelty. Reviewer #3 remains unconvinced. The editor decides to ignore these concerns and goes with the recommendation of the other reviewers to publish the manuscript. Check it out yourself to form your own opinion on this discussion!</p>

<p>A much wilder story is hidden in the peer review file of this optics paper from Tom Baden&#8217;s lab, which was finally published at Nature Communications. The first set of reviews at Nat Comm is still pretty normal, but then something goes wrong. Reviewer #4, who is &#8211; very obviously &#8211; highly competent but also a bit obsessed with details and annoyed by imprecision, has a few things to complain about, mostly about a few relatively small unsubstantiated claims and some minor errors that do not affect the main idea of the manuscript. However, the authors do not agree with this opinion, and a long and slowly escalating discussion between an annoyed reviewer and frustrated authors evolves. Check it out yourself. If you don&#8217;t get stomach pain while reading, you have my full admiration. At some point, reviewer #4 writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;In the last round of review, I wrote detailed comments, color-rebuttal, in a 16-page PDF, with the hope that they would be of help to the authors to make the manuscript better. The response I received on this round, surprisingly, is only 5 pages, and the authors reluctantly chose, on purpose or randomly, 5 comments to address, and ignored all other comments I curated. PLEASE RE-WRITE your response by addressing all comments I gave last time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Upon &#8220;editorial guidance&#8221;, the authors refrain from doing so. It all ends with mutual passive aggression (&#8220;No further comment&#8221; from both sides) &#8211; and acceptance for publication as an article.</p>



<p>Read it yourself to see how crazy and tiring peer review can be, and consider yourself how this situation could have been avoided by the authors or the reviewers. However, in the end, this review file is also a contribution to the scientific discussion (e.g., about proper PSF measurements) and therefore valuable by itself. It is a painful document, but also useful and full of insights.</p>

<p>Three-photon microscopy is a relatively new field still, and when these two papers came out in Nature Communications and eLife, respectively, I was very happy to be provided with the additional context and details in the peer review files. I found especially the discussion in the Nat Comm paper (paper 1) about potential concerns for three-photon imaging very interesting. </p>

<p>A few years ago, I had covered a preprint by Francioni et al. from the Rochefort lab <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/07/10/post-publication-review-somato-dendritic-coupling-of-l5-neurons-in-v1/">on my blog</a>. This study was later published on eLife, and since I liked the work of this paper already, I was very curious about the comments of the reviewers, their concerns, and the author&#8217;s replies. It is nice to get additional insights into such interesting studies!</p>

<p>The review file of this beautiful methods paper from the Burgalossi lab tells an interesting story. Apparently, the authors had included an additional experimental sub-study based on cfos in the paper, but the reviewers were not convinced by the results. They therefore suggested &#8211; very surprising to me! &#8211;  the acceptance of the paper for publication, but only after deletion of this subsection. I would not have guessed that such a unexpected and helpful consensus can be reached during the review process. This was probably helped by the fact that at eLife, it is common practice that editors and reviewers discuss their reviews with one another.</p>

<p>Purely theoretical (neuroscience) papers are often challenging because it is difficult to fully judge the novelty, even whenthe concepts and ideas and equations are transparent. This paper by Wu and Zenke is conceptually close to what I have studied experimentally during my PhD (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30786-4">paper link</a> in case you&#8217;re interested), so I was happy that this paper got published at eLife, with the review publicly available. A very useful secondary perspective!</p>

<p>This is &#8211; so far &#8211; the only paper with public review file where I have been involved as an author. I wrote some sections of the rebuttal letter, actually without knowing that the reviews and rebuttals would be openly available afterwards. Unfortunately, the journal (eNeuro) messed up the formatting in such a horrible way that the review file becomes almost unreadable (which is a pity, because our rebuttal letter was very nicely written). This mess-up shows that there is still some progress to make, also in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>In general, I hope that public review files will become more common in the future, to the extent that non-public review files will be a thing of the past entirely. Public reviews make the editorial process more transparent, they open up the discussion behind the paper, lower the barriers for junior researchers with less peer review experience, and do not have, to my understanding, any major negative side-effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starfish-skeleton-structure-diamond-strength-calcite">A diamondlike structure gives some starfish skeletons their strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some starfish made of a brittle material fortify themselves with architectural antics.</p>



<p>Beneath a starfish’s skin lies a skeleton made of pebbly growths, called ossicles, which mostly consist of the mineral calcite. Calcite is usually fragile, and even more so when it is porous. But the hole-riddled ossicles of the knobby starfish (<em>Protoreaster nodosus</em>) <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj9472">are strengthened through an unexpected internal arrangement</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 11 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“When we first saw the structure, we were really amazed,” says Ling Li, a materials scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. It looks like it’s been 3-D printed, he says.</p>



<p>Li and colleagues used an electron microscope to zoom in on ossicles from several dozen dead knobby starfish. At a scale of 50 micrometers, about half the width of a human hair, the seemingly featureless body of each ossicle gives way to a meshlike pattern that mirrors how carbon atoms are arranged in a diamond.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="3109110" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/021022_cw_starfish-strength_inline1_rev" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/021022_cw_starfish-strength_inline1_REV.jpg" data-orig-size="680,520" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="021022_cw_starfish-strength_inline1_REV" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Zooming in on the bumpy growths called ossicles (seen in this electron microscope image) that make up a knobby starfish’s skeleton reveals a meshlike structure similar to the arrangement of carbon atoms in diamond.

<p>But the diamondlike lattice alone doesn’t fully explain how the ossicles stay strong.</p>



<p>Within that lattice, the atoms that make up the calcite have their own pattern, which resembles a series of stacked hexagons. That pattern affects the strength of the calcite too. In general, a mineral’s strength isn’t uniform in all directions. So pushing on calcite in some directions is more likely to break it than force from other directions. In the ossicles, the atomic pattern and the diamondlike lattice align in a way that compensates for calcite’s intrinsic weakness<em>.</em></p>



<p>It’s a mystery how the animals make the diamondlike lattice. Li’s team is studying live knobby starfish, surveying the chemistry of how ossicles form. Understanding how the starfish build their ossicles may provide insights for creating stronger porous materials, including some ceramics.</p>



<p>We can learn a lot from a creature like a starfish that we may think is primitive, Li says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed">Omicron crushed delta in the U.S. These numbers show just how fast it happened</a></h4>

              
                <p>If it felt like omicron exploded with mind-boggling speed, a new look at the numbers backs that up. The highly contagious coronavirus variant achieved dominance in the United States in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106a4.htm?s_cid=mm7106a4_w">a record-breaking two weeks</a>; in comparison, it took the delta variant eight weeks to hit that milestone, researchers report in the Feb. 11 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Delta began <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">its climb to domination</a> amid a smorgasbord of variants circulating in the United States in early 2021 (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). At the beginning of May, delta was responsible for a mere 1 percent of new weekly infections. Eight weeks later, the week ending June 26, delta drove more than half of new infections. And by the end of July, the variant accounted for more than 95 percent of new COVID-19 cases each week.</p>

<p>Omicron, on the other hand, is estimated to have accomplished the same feat four times faster. U.S. public health officials documented the first omicron case on December 1, 2021. By the week ending December 11, the variant accounted for more than 1 percent of new cases. Only two weeks later, that number rocketed to more than 50 percent — then rose to more than 95 percent the week ending January 8.</p>





<p>The omicron variant’s rapid spread was likely driven by increased transmissibility over delta, as well as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">better ability to evade parts of the immune system</a>, the researchers say (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). Recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron may have extinguished the delta variant’s spread</a> in the United States by February 5, though it’s possible that the analysis wasn’t broad enough to catch any lurking delta variants. The numbers can also change over time as officials analyze more data.</p>

<h3>Competing coronaviruses</h3>



<p>Many different variants were circulating in the United States in early 2021 (colored by variant). Delta (orange), which made up a tiny fraction of cases in the spring, took over during the summer only to be rapidly displaced by omicron (purple) at the end of the year.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-lung-infection-fossils-oldest-case">Fossils reveal what may be the oldest known case of the dino sniffles</a></h4>

              
                <p>The prehistoric world wasn&#8217;t a paradise free of disease, but diagnosing ancient ailments is tricky: Germs usually don’t fossilize well. Now, though, researchers have unearthed evidence of what appears to be the oldest known respiratory infection in a dinosaur.</p>



<p>Lesions found in the vertebrae of a 150-million-year-old juvenile sauropod dubbed “Dolly” point to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05761-3">a lung infection that moved into her bones</a>, vertebrate paleontologist Cary Woodruff and colleagues report February 10 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. That’s at least 50 million years older than <a href="https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/sjpalaeontology/article/view/20305/0">the previously reported respiratory infection in a titanosaur</a> unearthed in Brazil.</p>



<p>Dolly, a long-necked dinosaur, was probably closely related to <em>Diplodocus</em>. At the time of her death in what’s now southwestern Montana, she was about 18 meters long and less than 20 years old, Woodruff estimates.</p>



<p>The fossils that the team analyzed include the dinosaur’s skull and the first seven neck vertebrae, which contained air sacs connected to the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. The bones of many of today’s birds, which are modern-day dinosaurs, have similar features.&nbsp;</p>





<p>On the fifth through seventh vertebrae, the fossils have bone lesions at spots where the air sacs would have intruded into the bone, the team found. The oddly shaped and textured bumps protrude from the bone as much as 1 centimeter, says Woodruff, of the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum in Malta, Mont.</p>

<p>So many lesions turning up in similar spots are unlikely to be bone tumors, which in birds are rather uncommon anyway, Woodruff notes. Instead, the lesions formed in response to a respiratory infection that spread to the distant air sacs, the team proposes.</p>



<p>Though Dolly’s bone lesions wouldn’t have been obvious to an ancient observer, she likely had a fever, cough, labored breathing and nasal discharge, the scientists suggest.</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the infection was bacterial, viral or fungal, or whether it is what killed Dolly. But the researchers note that many birds and reptiles today can suffer from a respiratory infection caused by the fungus <em>Aspergillus </em>that can in turn lead to bone infections.</p>





<p>For an infection in the neck vertebrae’s air sacs to cause bony lesions, “you’re looking at a chronic condition,” says Cynthia Faux, a veterinarian at the University of Arizona in Tucson with a degree in vertebrate paleontology who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Diseases such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turn-your-head-and-roar">arthritis and gout as well as other infections</a> have been reported previously in dinosaurs and other ancient creatures (<em>SN: 12/11/01</em>). And while Dolly’s respiratory infection seems to be the oldest known for a dinosaur, it’s nowhere near the record. In 2018, researchers described a tuberculosis-like infection in a marine reptile that lived about 245 million years ago.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s tricky to investigate fear. An ethics panel would frown on shooting at people (even with pellet guns), or exposing them to simulated suffocation — or drowning. Though we know that scary situations trigger physiological arousal so that we can fight or flee, ethical and practical concerns have made it hard to get at just how that plays out in the real world. Enter a team from the California Institute of Technology, who left the lab in favour of an <a href="https://the17thdoor.com/about/">immersive scary prison attraction</a> in nearby Orange County.</p>



<span id="more-45330"></span>



<p>Each of the 17 rooms of the experience feature different threats. These include suffocation, moving floors, being blindfolded in front of a firing squad (armed with pellet guns) and electric shocks. As Sarah M. Tashjian and her colleagues note in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211032231">their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, “Many threats were more threatening and/or pain inducing than is ethically allowed in campus laboratory in the United States.” The participants were 156 customers, who were recruited after paying for their entry and being assigned to a guided group of 8-10 people.</p>



<p>After reporting on how many friends vs strangers were in their group, they completed a questionnaire that asked, among other things, about how much fear they were feeling, and expected to feel once inside. Next, they were fitted with a wrist-worn wireless sensor that monitored their skin conductance, which indicated how much they were sweating (more sweating indicates greater physiological arousal). Then off they went for a half-hour tour through &#8220;Perpetuum Penitentiary&#8221;, home to murderers and &#8220;vile and sadistic engineers&#8221; set on treating &#8220;the evils of humanity&#8221;… At the end, they reported on how much fear they’d actually felt.</p>



<p>The fear questionnaires produced some interesting results. Women reported expecting to feel more fear inside than men did, and also afterwards reported having felt more fear. Overall, though, both genders expected to feel more fear than they actually felt. The team also found that people who reported feeling more scared inside had experienced more frequent skin conductance &#8220;bursts&#8221;. This suggests that how scary you find an experience is a feature of the number of arousal &#8220;spikes&#8221; you experience. The team also notes that, perhaps unsurprisingly, unexpected sudden scares triggered bigger leaps in arousal than scares that the participants could anticipate.</p>



<p>One of the aims of the study was also to explore how the presence of friends and strangers influences the fear response. After all, when we face a threat in the real world, we’re often in the company of at least one other person. But the evidence in this area has been conflicting — some research suggests that the presence of friends buffers us from the effects of unpleasant experiences, while other studies have found that we &#8220;catch&#8221; more fear from friends than strangers.</p>



<p>The team found that people who went through Perpetuum Penitentiary with relatively more friends than strangers had <em>higher</em> background-level arousal throughout the experience. This seems to fit with the idea of emotion contagion, not social buffering. However, the team’s own data showed that more frequent arousal spikes — not higher background arousal — was linked to feeling more scared. Physiological arousal is associated not just with fear, though, but excitement. Perhaps the presence of more friends vs strangers boosted background excitement (rather than fear). But as the participants didn’t report on excitement levels, this is an open question.</p>



<p>There are a few other limitations to the study. One: the participants had all chosen to attend the attraction, no doubt because they expected to enjoy it. Other people might not respond in the same way. Also, Perpetuum Penitentiary was &#8220;safe scary&#8221;; the visitors knew they weren’t really going to be shot or drowned, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/12/not-too-scary-not-too-tame-horror-experiences-need-to-hit-a-sweet-spot-to-be-enjoyable/">recreational horror experiences do need to hit a fear sweet spot between fear and fun to be enjoyable</a>. So there are a few gaps between an experience like this and a real life scary situation.</p>



<p>Still, given all the obstacles to researching fear in the lab, and the scarcity of good data on how we react to scary situations — especially when other people are around — this is really interesting work. It “provides an important proof of concept and guide for field experiments to probe contributors to threat psychology,” the team writes — and it’s hard to argue with that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter">Homo sapiens may have reached Europe 10,000 years earlier than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> began migrating into Europe much longer ago than has typically been assumed.</p>



<p>Discoveries at a rock-shelter in southern France put <em>H. sapiens</em> in Europe as early as 56,800 years ago, a new study finds. That’s around <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-humans-europe-bacho-kiro-bulgaria">10,000 years earlier than previously thought</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>The French site, called Grotte Mandrin, was alternately occupied by the <em>H. sapiens</em> newcomers and Neandertals native to Europe, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj9496">replacing each other a couple of times</a> before Neandertals died out roughly 40,000 years ago, researchers report February 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The finds from the rock-shelter, situated 225 meters above the middle Rhône River Valley, challenge a popular view that Neandertals died out within a few thousand years of <em>H. sapiens</em> reaching Europe, say archaeologist Ludovic Slimak of the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès in France and colleagues.</p>





<p>Slimak has directed excavations at Grotte Mandrin for the last 24 years. Nearly 60,000 stone artifacts and more than 70,000 bones of horses, bison and other animals have been unearthed in 12 sediment layers. Only nine isolated hominid teeth have been found in five of those layers. But these teeth can be categorized as either Neandertal or <em>H. sapiens</em> based on their shapes and sizes, the researchers say. The oldest <em>H. sapiens</em> material in the rock-shelter includes a single tooth from a 2- to 6-year-old child, Slimak says.</p>



<p>Dating of each sediment layer relied on radiocarbon age estimates for excavated bone artifacts and calculations of the time elapsed since each set of finds was buried and certain stones were heated during toolmaking.</p>



<p>Given this evidence, it now appears that <em>H. sapiens</em> groups periodically entered southern Europe long before Neandertals went extinct, says paleoanthropologist Isabelle Crevecoeur of the University of Bordeaux in France, who did not participate in the new study. “The arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em> in Europe after the demise of Neandertals was probably the end of a long, sometimes unsuccessful, migration process.”</p>



<p><em>H. sapiens</em> who first settled at Grotte Mandrin consisted of several dozen individuals or more, Slimak estimates. Archaeological evidence indicates that, between 56,800 and 51,700 years ago, those ancient people inhabited the site for some 40 years. “This was not a short-term hunter-gatherer camp but a tentative colonization of Europe,” Slimak says.</p>



<p>Resident Neandertals and ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> migrants had at least brief contacts, Slimak says. Flint used by <em>H. sapiens</em> to make tools came from sources located within 100 kilometers of the rock-shelter in all directions, knowledge that could have been acquired only with the help of Neandertals already well-versed in the region’s landscape, Slimak contends.</p>



<p>After <em>H. sapiens’</em> 40-year stay, Neandertals returned to the rock-shelter, where their earliest occupations date as far back as 120,000 years ago, the researchers found. <em>H. sapiens</em> reoccupied the site between about 44,100 and 41,500 years ago — roughly 14,000 years after their initial visit. After that, Neandertals left no signs of having come back.</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, small stone points and blades made by Grotte Mandrin <em>H. sapiens</em> as many as 56,800 years ago match those previously attributed to <em>H. sapiens</em> at a site in Lebanon dating to around 40,000 years ago. Archaeologists have struggled for over a century to figure out who made the same types of stone tools, dating to about the same time, at several middle Rhône Valley sites, including Grotte Mandrin.</p>



<p>Ancient Middle Easterners whose descendants made tools at the Lebanese site traveled some 3,000 kilometers to reach Grotte Mandrin, likely by navigating vessels of some kind along the Mediterranean coast, Slimak suspects. Their toolmaking tradition was then passed down through many generations by groups living near the rock-shelter, he speculates.</p>



<p>Though no evidence exists of ancient sea trips from the Middle East to what’s now southern France, “it seems that <em>H. sapiens</em> arrived in Europe several times, and we cannot exclude that [they] arrived even earlier than 56,000 years ago,” says paleoanthropologist Stefano Benazzi of the University of Bologna in Italy, who was not part of Slimak’s team.</p>



<p>But the significance of the Grotte Mandrin finds, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">the evolutionary relationship of <em>H. sapiens</em> to Neandertals</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>), is controversial. A single <em>H. sapiens</em> tooth deposited between 56,800 and 51,700 years ago can’t conclusively demonstrate that <em>H. sapiens</em> but not Neandertals made tools found in that sediment layer, says evolutionary biologist Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar National Museum.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">Genetic evidence points to mating between Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>), raising the possibility that hybrid offspring of those populations fashioned stone tools at the French site, Finlayson says.</p>



<p>To confirm the evolutionary identities of Grotte Mandrin’s various Stone Age toolmakers, Slimak’s team is now attempting to extract ancient DNA from hominid teeth and sediment at the site.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">Weird ‘superionic’ matter could make up Earth’s inner core</a></h4>

              
                <p>A quirky material that behaves like a mishmash of liquid and solid could be hidden deep in the Earth.</p>



<p>Computer simulations described in two studies suggest that the material in Earth’s inner core, which includes iron and other, lighter elements, may be in a “superionic” state. That means that while the iron stays put, as in a solid, the lighter elements flow like a liquid.</p>



<p>The research gives a potential peek at the inner workings of an enigmatic, inaccessible realm of the planet. According to conventional scientific wisdom, Earth’s core consists of a liquid outer core surrounding a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field">solid inner core</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>). But beyond knowing that the inner core is rich in iron, scientists don’t know exactly which other elements are present, and in what quantities.</p>



<p>“The inner core is very difficult to scrutinize simply because it’s so deep beneath our feet,” says geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić of Australian National University in Canberra.</p>





<p>Seismic waves stirred up by earthquakes can plow through the inner core, providing clues to what’s inside. But measurements of these waves have left researchers puzzled. The velocity of one type of wave, called a shear wave, is lower than expected for solid iron or for many types of iron alloys — mixtures of iron with other materials. “That is a mystery about the inner core,” says geophysicist Yu He of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guiyang.</p>



<p>In one new study, He and colleagues simulated a group of 64 iron atoms, along with various types of lighter elements — hydrogen, carbon and oxygen — under pressures and temperatures expected for the inner core. In a normal solid, atoms arrange themselves in an orderly grid, holding fast to their positions. In a superionic material, some of the atoms arrange neatly, as in a solid, while others are liquid-like free spirits that slip right through the solid lattice. In the simulation, the researchers found, the lighter elements moved about while the iron stayed in place.</p>



<p>That superionic status <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04361-x">slowed shear waves</a>, the researchers report February 9 in <em>Nature</em>, suggesting the weird phase of matter could explain the unexpected shear wave velocity measured in the inner core.</p>



<p>Shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-seismic-waves-come-different-flavors">jiggle the Earth</a> perpendicular to their direction of travel, like the undulations that move along a jump rope that’s wiggled up and down (<em>SNS: 1/12/18</em>). Other waves, called primary or P waves, compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, like an accordion being squeezed.</p>



<p>To really explain the inner core, scientists must find a combination of elements that keeps with everything scientists know about the inner core, including its S wave velocity, P wave velocity and its density. “You have to match all three things, otherwise it doesn’t work,” says mineral physicist John Brodholt of University College London.</p>



<p>In a study published in August 2021 in <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>, Brodholt and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X21002739">did just that</a>. A simulation of iron, silicon and hydrogen atoms reproduced the inner core’s known characteristics. In the simulation, the material was also superionic: The iron and silicon stayed in position while the hydrogen flowed like a liquid.</p>



<p>But Brodholt notes that their result is just one possible explanation for the inner core’s properties. Brodholt and his colleagues have previously found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X18302085">other combinations of elements that could explain the inner core</a> without going superionic, he says, leaving unresolved the question of what lurks in Earth’s deepest depths.</p>



<p>Another puzzle of Earth’s heart is the fact that the inner core’s structure seems to change over time. This has previously been interpreted as evidence that the inner core rotates at a different rate than the rest of the Earth. But He and colleagues suggest that it could instead result from the motions of liquid-like light elements swirling inside the inner core and changing the distribution of elements over time. “This paper sort of offers an explanation for both of these phenomena” — the slow shear wave velocity and the shifting structure — says Tkalčić, who was not involved with either new study.</p>



<p>One thing missing is laboratory experiments showing how these combinations of elements behave under inner core conditions, says geophysicist Daniele Antonangeli of Sorbonne University in Paris, who was not involved with the new research. Such tests could help confirm whether the simulations are correct.</p>



<p>Previous experiments have found evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superionic-ice-liquid-solid-physics">water ice can go superionic</a>, perhaps under conditions found inside Uranus or Neptune (<em>SN: 2/5/18</em>). But researchers can’t yet probe the behavior of superionic materials under the conditions thought to exist inside Earth’s core. So scientists will have to keep pushing the tests to further extremes, Antonangeli says. “The experimentalist that is within me craves seeing experimental validation of this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">How the Human Genome Project revolutionized understanding of our DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In October 1990, biologists officially embarked on one of the century’s most ambitious scientific efforts: reading the 3 billion pairs of genetic subunits — the A’s, T’s, C’s and G’s — that make up the human instruction book. </p>



<p>The project promised to blow open our understanding of basic biology, reveal relationships between the myriad forms of life on the planet and transform medicine through insights into genetic diseases and potential cures. When <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-work-reaches-milestone">a draft of the instruction book was announced in 2000</a>, the scientists having read essentially every letter, President Bill Clinton called it a “stunning and humbling achievement” and predicted it would “revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of most, if not all, human diseases.”</p>



<p>Even dreaming up such an endeavor depended on decades of previous discoveries. In 1905, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Bateson">English biologist William Bateson</a>, who championed the work of Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, suggested the term genetics for a new field of study focused on heredity and variation. Early the next decade, American biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues showed that genes are carried on chromosomes. Biochemists had been studying DNA for nearly three-quarters of a century when Oswald Avery and his team at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City helped establish in the 1940s that DNA is the genetic material. And perhaps most notable, and famous today, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/way-life-handed">the 1953 discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA</a>, by James Watson and Francis Crick of the University of Cambridge and Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins of King’s College London.</p>

<p>But when the draft instruction book was first published, independently by an international collective of academic and government labs called the Human Genome Project and the private company Celera Genomics, led by J. Craig Venter, the text was “as striking for what we don’t see as for what we do,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-sequenced-genome-bares-all"><em>Science News</em> reported</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/01, p. 100</em>). There were many fewer genes than expected, leaving a puzzle about what all the remaining DNA was for.</p>



<p>In the decades since, scientists have filled in some of that puzzle — identifying a host of genes, for example, that don’t make proteins but are still essential in the body. Other researchers have searched the instruction book to find new treatments for diseases and to figure out how we’re all related — not just people, but all life on planet Earth, past and present.</p>



<p>To explore how far our understanding of our DNA has come, <em>Science News</em> senior writer and molecular biology reporter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tina-hesman-saey">Tina Hesman Saey</a> talked with <a href="https://www.genome.gov/staff/Eric-D-Green-MD-PhD">Eric Green</a>, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Green got his start in genomics in the lab of Maynard Olson at Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the field. At the same time, Saey was a graduate student in molecular genetics, working down the hall. She remembers as an undergraduate student sequencing the genes of bacteria 50 to 100 chemical subunits, or bases, at a time. “My mind was completely blown by the idea that you could put together 3 billion bases.” The conversation that follows, which has been edited for length and clarity, looks back on the project and ahead to all that’s left to learn. <em>— Elizabeth Quill</em></p>

<h4>Ambitious beginnings</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> My first memory of the Human Genome Project was when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, and I remember Walter Gilbert, who is a Nobel Prize winner, coming and talking about the project. He proposed this really audacious idea of sequencing 3 billion pairs of bases in the human genome — all of our DNA. After Gilbert’s talk, I walked back to the lab with a couple of professors, and they were saying, “This can never happen. It’s going to cost way too much money. There’s just no way we can do this.” So how did you pull it off?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> By the time the genome project started in October of 1990, I was working in a cutting-edge genomics lab at Washington University. We were one of the first funded groups to participate in the Human Genome Project. We had some ideas on how to start, and we had really no idea how we were going to pull it off.</p>



<p>It was the overwhelmingly compelling vision for why this was so important that galvanized enthusiasm among not only a group of scientists like myself, but also the funding agencies, the governments, the private funders from around the world, who said, “This seems unimaginable, like putting a person on the moon, but it seems so important. We’ll figure it out.” So it was one of these circumstances where you just get the right people in the right place, get them resourced, get them organized, be willing to do things differently, and then figure it out as you go.</p>





<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I got to witness this because I was a graduate student at Washington University, in a lab sequencing the yeast genome. Robert Waterston’s lab, which received one of the first grants from the Human Genome Project, was right across the hall. They started with <em>C. elegans</em>, the roundworm genome. I remember they were starting very methodically, mapping out the genes and then sequencing each piece, marching along. But then, toward the end of the ’90s, there was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/another-human-genome-project">this shotgun sequencing revolution</a> spearheaded by kind of a controversial figure, Craig Venter. You just shred the genome, throw it all in a sequencing machine and then put it together in the computer. Did that help a lot?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question it sped things up. What Craig successfully did was to determine that there were approaches that could be used where you didn’t have to do piecemeal sequencing. The important nuance to point out is the only way you’re able to put [the pieces] back together then was by having many mapping elements that allow you to hang pieces together and organize them. It’s not like it all zipped together 3 billion letters. A lot of the meticulous mapping that had been done, painstaking mapping, helped provide organizing guideposts.</p>



<p>The press covered it as a race, and the press covered it as option A versus option B. And the truth resided somewhere in between. What was driving the change, of course, was technology advances. If you chart the time since the end of the Human Genome Project, it’s the same phenomenon. Every single time there’s a technology surge, you find yourself doing things completely different than the way you used to.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Technology has come a very long way from what I was doing. You can sequence thousands of bases at a time now.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> The other part of the story that sometimes doesn’t get told: It’s not even just the laboratory bench–based technologies. It’s also the computational technologies. Some people don’t realize that when the Human Genome Project started, there was not really a widely functional internet. I was just barely starting to use e-mail.</p>



<p>So here it was, we were one of the first funded groups for the Human Genome Project. We were considered state of the art. We were collaborating with an outside group generating some sequences, and the only practical way for my collaborator to get me the 300 to 400 bases of sequence was to handwrite it on a piece of paper and fax it to me. And I would analyze it by eye. It’s just remarkable that that was where we were when the project started.</p>

<h4>Garbage to gold mine</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> In 2000 was the big press conference to announce the rough draft of the human genome. I was just starting my journalism career at the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, and reported on this. At that time, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-sequenced-genome-bares-all">it was a big revelation that there were these big deserts in between genes</a>, and that we didn’t have nearly as many genes as we thought we were going to. Humans are such complex organisms, how could we not have many more genes than a fruit fly, or a worm? That just didn’t make sense.</p>



<p>But now, I think, we are getting a better understanding, largely because of the way we can analyze the genome. Can you talk about how that evolution in thinking has progressed?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Before the genome project started, some [people] were quite critical, and really said it was a bad idea. Some argued that it was a waste of time to sequence the genome end to end; we should just focus and sequence the genes, as if all of humans’ biological richness was going to reside in the genes. Thank goodness we didn’t listen to those critics. Because if we would have done the shortcut and only focused on the genes, we would have only skimmed the biological complexity of humans.</p>



<p>What we’ve come to learn is that while only 1.5 percent of the letters of the human genome directly encode for what are classically known as protein-coding genes — DNA that gets made into RNA, which gets made into protein — there’s a much larger fraction of the human genome that is biologically important and evolutionarily conserved. It’s widened our definition of a gene, because we now know that sometimes DNA may make RNA, and RNA may go off and do all sorts of biological things.</p>



<p>Then there’s a whole set of sequences that are far more plentiful than gene sequences, that are really doing all the choreography in our genomes in terms of determining when, where and how much genes get turned on, in what cells and what tissues, at what developmental stages, under what conditions, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>It pushed us to think about all the other biological functions in DNA outside the genes. And as you accurately point out, we don’t really have a rulebook for that. And thank goodness the computer technology is helping us because the human eye would just fail miserably at figuring this out. And so as much as anything, computational biology, bioinformatics, data science are the dominant research tools to help bring clarity as to how noncoding sequences in the human genome function. And how they do that in a very carefully crafted choreography with the genes.</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Well, I’m glad you brought up those sequences, because those are some of my favorites. I’m a huge fan of noncoding RNAs [the RNAs that don’t go on to make proteins]. There are so many of them, and such a huge variety of them. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-molecules-crucial-roles-human-health-disease">they work in so many important ways</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>I don’t think that 20 years ago we could have conceived that RNAs that didn’t make proteins would actually be important for something. The genes those RNAs were copied from were considered broken genes or pseudogenes. They were junk.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Or sloppy transcription; that our enzymes are just going off and making a bunch of RNA because they don’t know how to control themselves. But, no. And I like your point about 20 years ago, we couldn’t imagine. I would propose that 20 years from now, we might look back at this conversation and say, “Oh, my goodness, think about all these other ways that the genome functions.” There’s no reason to think we have our hands around it all in terms of all the biological complexity of DNA; I’m quite sure we don’t.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> And even when you find a protein-coding gene, you’re <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wiring-depends-multifaceted-gene">not just making one protein</a>. You’re making, on average, seven or eight different versions of this protein from the same gene. After RNA gets copied from DNA, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-chicken-fewer-grape">you can mix and match the little parts of a gene</a> to make completely new proteins. And then you can tack on all of these other little chemical groups to change the way things work.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> When I was getting my Ph.D. at Washington University in the 1980s, I didn’t work on DNA, I didn’t work on molecular biology, I didn’t work on RNA. I was working on a set of proteins, studying how they had sugar molecules added to them after they were made, and how, depending upon what tissue they were made in, they got different structures of sugar molecules attached. So just as you point out, you start off with one gene, and you can end up with multiple RNAs that lead to multiple different proteins. And each of those proteins could have different modifications depending on what tissue, what conditions, what development stage, et cetera. This is the incredible amplification of complexity. It’s not in our gene number. We have a long way to go to fully understanding all this.</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Another thing that really surprises people is how much of our genome is made of extinct viruses and transposons — transposons being these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-genes-play-big-role-what-makes-us-human">jumping genes that still hop around in our genome</a>. Those transposons can occasionally cause problems, but we also got a lot of innovations from them, including the human placenta, and maybe some things about the way our brain works. So, we’re not even completely human. If you want to view it that way, we’re a lot virus.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Right. We’re a lot virus. We’re also not all <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Many, many people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">carry Neandertal bits</a> from a time when Neandertals and <em>Homo sapiens</em> coexisted, and actually interbred (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 7</em>). But not everybody in the world has that, which is also interesting. One of the aspects of genomics is that it not only has taught us and given us the biological instruction book, it’s also given us a fascinating record of evolution. We can use it to learn lots of things about our evolution, about human migrations, about aspects of humans on this globe.</p>



<h4>Focus on diversity</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Most people who are interacting with DNA and with the human genome these days do it through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-ancestry-dna">ancestry testing and consumer DNA testing</a>. So you can identify the part of the world that people’s DNA came from. And that gets into a lot of discussion about race, and whether race has a biological basis, and what that might mean for medicine.</p>



<p>There’s been a lot of criticism lately of genetics and genomics, because it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">based a lot on the DNA of people of European ancestry</a> — white people like you and me. But there’s a huge amount of genetic diversity in the world among humans, and especially in Africa, where humans got started. So what are we doing about getting a handle on the vast array of diversity that humans have?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that the successes in genomics that we’ve been discussing are worth talking about and worth show­casing. At the same time, as a field, we have not been perfect. One of the things that we just have to admit that we’ve really not been as successful on is making sure we’ve captured enough of the diversity of the human population with respect to the samples that we’ve used for doing genetic and genomic studies. We have got to fix this problem. It’s a very high priority.</p>



<p>I really want to emphasize, it’s not even just that it’s the socially right thing to do, that everybody should have information about their genomes. This is very important medically. If the only populations we have a lot of genomic data on are people of European descent, we limit our ability to move genomic analyses and eventually genomic medicine into populations that are not of European descent. And so there’s a high priority through a number of efforts around the world, including in the U.S., to work hard to capture much more diversity of the world’s populations in all studies that we do.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> There’s been a lot of talk about racialized medicine, where you might have a person come in who is African American, and then you would say, “Oh, well, we should consider this to be the genome that we look at.” Is that a good approach to take? Or do you think it should be broader somehow?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> The truth is, of course, there are certain diseases that tend to cluster in certain populations of common ancestry. And many times those are represented by racial groups.</p>



<p>But racial grouping is really a social construct that has numerous imperfections. And so on the one hand, you can’t totally ignore some correlations that exist with certain diseases or certain responses to medications in certain groups. But it’s a very blunt tool to use. And we could do better. The way we could do this better is to track much more accurately to specific genomic features, as opposed to certain racial characteristics. So I think what we really want to pay attention to, and we will be doing this increasingly, is thinking about better ways of grouping and stratifying individuals and populations.</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I wanted to touch too on what we mean when we say genetic diversity. For the most part I think people are familiar with what scientists call SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and what other people might refer to as mutations. But there are lots of other ways that you can have diversity in the genome: You can be missing entire genes or entire chunks of chromosomes or you can have duplications of certain genes. Are we now able to look at that type of diversity as well? And do we know if that’s important?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that all forms of genomic diversity — genomic variation is probably the word I would use — are not only biologically relevant, they’re proving to be medically relevant. Now, we don’t have a complete inventory of which ones are more relevant than others. But we already know of many examples where medically relevant variations in our genome can be a single letter, a string of letters, it could mean having extra letters or extra segments, or missing segments. It could be a rearrangement of segments. Every one of those [types of variations] are already known to be important in human disease, and eventually will be important for diagnostic medicine and the implementation of genomic medicine.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Do you envision a time when we will be able to study and interpret these bigger changes?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> I absolutely envision a time where people will get their complete genome sequenced end to end as part of their medical care, and maybe even at birth. I don’t think we’re there yet. But I truly believe that we will want that information as part of medical management. And I fully believe that technologies will become available and will be inexpensive enough to make it worthwhile. But those predictions are going to have to be based on evidence that indeed that’s feasible and valuable.</p>



<h4>What’s next?</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> So <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">where do we go from here</a>? What does the National Human Genome Research Institute do now that researchers have generated end-to-end sequences of every human chromosome?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> We recently finished a two-and-a-half-year strategic planning process to ask that very question for this coming decade. It was actually an overwhelming exercise because there were so many good ideas. We published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2817-4">these in <em>Nature</em></a> — our 2020 strategic vision. Some of it [is] applications of genomics to medicine. Of course, everybody’s going to be excited about that. But there are many other forefronts of genomics that are just as exciting.</p>



<p>We still don’t have the perfect technologies that we can deploy anywhere in the world in any health setting, any medical study, that will get us end-to-end sequencing. We need better and cheaper technologies for letting us read human genome sequences inexpensively in clinical settings. We need complete end-to-end interpretation of every base of the human genome. We need to know not just about the genes, we need to know about all these noncoding regions. We need to understand every human variant that we can find in the world population. And we need to know: Is that variant biologically silent? Is it biologically relevant? Is it medically relevant? If it’s medically relevant, what’s the action that should be taken? That starts to point us to understanding the genomic basis of disease and also to think about how can we use information about genomic variation in the practice of medicine.</p>



<p>Also, we will continue to think about the implications of these genomic advances to society. How are we going to make sure people understand this? How are we going to make sure things are applied equitably? How are we going to make sure it doesn’t exacerbate inequities in our society? How are we going to deal with a whole host of issues related to privacy?</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I’m glad that you brought up equity and privacy, because those are some of the things that people are most concerned about right now. There are a lot of historically marginalized people who don’t want any part of genetic research because of the way their groups have been treated in the past. There’s been this history of colonialism. These groups say, if we’re going to do genetics on our people, then it should be our people doing it for us. What is NHGRI doing to build capacity in these communities so that they can do their own research and, maybe, if they decide they want to, share that with other people?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> I completely agree with the notion that if genomics is going to be a successful field, especially as we move this into medicine, we have got to make sure that we engage people from all different communities, all definitions of diversity, and make sure they benefit from it. We absolutely emphasize this point repeatedly in our 2020 strategic vision, so much so that the very first thing we did in 2021 was to release what we call <a href="https://www.genome.gov/news/news-release/NHGRI-proposes-an-action-agenda-for-building-a-diverse-genomics-workforce">an action agenda for enhancing the diversity of the genomics workforce</a>.</p>



<p>Another experience we’ve had at NIH that I think is very illustrative of this: We recognized that we wanted African scientists to get more involved in doing genomics. And through a program called H3Africa, the <a href="https://h3africa.org/">Human Heredity and Health in Africa program</a>, that the NIH and the Wellcome Trust funded, the philosophical mantra is to empower African scientists to do all the studies and build capacity there. It’s been a success by almost any metric. But it’s exactly what you said: We want them to do the studies, we want them to engage with their local communities. We’ll never build the trust if we just come in and say, “We’re going to do all of this.”</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> In terms of privacy, you’ve said a couple of times that you could have somebody’s genome completely sequenced, and then their doctor can use it. But don’t we get into a situation that could be like the movie <em>Gattaca</em>? Some people could be discriminated against if they don’t have their genetic flaws fixed? Are you somehow creating a class of lesser people and more perfect people who don’t have the genetic flaws that everybody else has?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> You just laid out several major ethical dilemmas, and they’re all valid, and we could spend hours talking about each of them. What I would say about our field is, we’ve recognized that everything we are doing is a two-edged sword. On the one edge of that sword are these incredible opportunities for improving the practice of medicine. On the other edge of that sword, as with many technologies, it could be used in ways that would be societally unacceptable. It’s a reason why the field has from the beginning always embraced and invested in <a href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/ELSI-Research-Program-ethical-legal-social-implications">ethical, legal and social implications research</a>, or ELSI research, which has attempted to anticipate these concerns and try to provide an evidence base to build policies, and in some cases, laws.</p>



<p>We do have in the United States a major act called the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-2008">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act</a>, which offers some protection against genetic discrimination. We have laws and policies that protect people’s medical information.</p>

<p>We should recognize that genomics is just part of a bigger set of societal issues, as more and more intimate information about us is electronically available. Trust me, we can learn a lot about you if we just reviewed your Visa card purchases. We as a society have to recognize that, yes, genomic information has some unique attributes, but it’s not totally exceptional. We need to be part of a broader framework for protecting people so that we can benefit from these incredible opportunities.</p>



<p>We just need to make sure we don’t get too far out over our skis. Just because we can do something, doesn’t mean we should. We need to think about all the consequences. We should be constantly understanding what will society tolerate, what do people not want. We have some things that are going to be completely unacceptable, like doing genetic editing in unborn children. At this stage, we simply don’t think that’s a smart thing to do, we’re not ready to do it, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-edited-babies-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the scientific community has condemned doing it</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 20</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I do want to circle back, because when we were talking about these noncoding sequences, a lot of them help control how genes are used. That may not be so obvious if you just get this string of somebody’s DNA letters. Can you tell from that how those genes will be used? And how those things will be put together? Or is that something you cannot tell by looking at DNA?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that sometimes when you talk about genomics, and you talk about genetics, and you focus on the genes — you sometimes see the tree and you lose track of the forest. The forest is medical complexity and biological complexity. And for most things about ourselves, how tall we are, what we look like, and common diseases — hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, autism, et cetera — things are much more complicated than looking even for one gene. It’s multiple genes. And it’s almost always a greater choreography with our lifestyle, and our social experiences, and our exposures and everything from diet to exercise. There’s a lot more to health and disease than just our genes.</p>



<p>The grand challenge in many ways for the coming decade or two is doing these very large-scale studies where we have as much data as possible, not just genomic data, but lifestyle data and electronic health record data, and environmental data and physiological data. There are absolutely going to be patterns. And we’ve just got to find those patterns.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> We’re almost out of time. It’s been wonderful talking with you. Did we miss anything?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> We missed all sorts of wonderful things, but you can only spend so much time walking down memory lane.</p>



<p>What I would say in closing are two things people need to remember: First of all, how incredibly exciting this field is, and how incredibly eager we are to build our tent with more and more people from all different disciplines. And we also want people of all different populations and ancestral groups from all parts of the world. It’s going to be so important to do that.</p>



<p>The reason we want all these people involved is, we just touched on so many things that we still don’t understand. We need creativity. And we don’t have a playbook. Just like those days where we were bewildered of how we were going to get the Human Genome Project really done, I don’t really know how we’re going to get complete end-to-end understanding of the human genome. But I know if we get creative people working on it, we’ll make incredible progress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-data-represent-black-people-tshaka-cunningham">How one scientist aims to boost Black people’s representation in genetic datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly two decades after researchers assembled the first genetic blueprint for human life, our understanding of our instruction manual has a dramatic and problematic bias: It’s based primarily on white people.</p>



<p>The overwhelming majority of genetic data is from people of European ancestry. As of early January, nearly 96 percent of participants across more than 5,500 studies looking for genetic variants associated with disease or other traits were of European descent, according to the <a href="https://gwasdiversitymonitor.com/">GWAS Diversity Monitor</a>, a real-time online tracker developed and maintained by the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford. Those with African American or Afro-Caribbean ancestry amount to just 0.18 percent of participants; Hispanic or Latino populations just 0.23 percent. That means efforts aspiring to use DNA to identify the best treatments for any individual patient, what’s commonly known as precision medicine, are heavily skewed toward white people.</p>



<p>There are many reasons behind the stark disparity. A big one, says geneticist Tshaka Cunningham, is distrust of the medical community, born from decades of exploitation and abuse: The Tuskegee Study, where white researchers for decades didn’t treat Black men with syphilis, even after penicillin proved effective against the disease. The case of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer biopsy gave rise to cells that today serve as a crucial resource for scientific studies even though she never gave consent. The forced sterilization of Black, Latina and Indigenous women that was driven by the eugenics movement — the damaging effects of which persist today.</p>

<p>What happened to Lacks, for example, “left a scar on many a minority person,” Cunningham says. “It’s like, ‘Am I gonna get Henrietta Lacks-ed or Tuskegee-ed?’”</p>



<p>Cunningham is working with others to build trust and overcome the damage of the past. He is chief scientific officer of Polaris Genomics, a company studying the genetic underpinnings that put some people at increased risk of certain behavioral health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder. He is also executive director of the <a href="https://www.fbgri.org">Faith Based Genetic Research Institute</a>, a nonprofit that aims to educate people, primarily people of color, about the value of engaging with the medical community and genetics research.</p>



<p><em>Science News’</em> Erin Garcia de Jesús spoke with Cunningham about the need for diverse data in genetics and the challenges researchers face in reaching minority groups.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Why is it important to have diverse participants in genetics research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> One is the societal imperative for equity — and having research, and products [such as genetic tests and treatments] be broadly available for people. You don’t want to have health disparities between communities. And when it comes to genetics, genomics and precision medicine, you already see this growing divide pushed by one-sided research. Mostly Caucasian groups have been included in genomic research to date, yet the results are meant to be applied to all others too.</p>



<p>There are genetic tests, for example, that have been developed based on research in specific communities. Like for <em>BRCA1</em>. [Mutations in the gene have been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer and are commonly considered in deciding on treatment approach.] You may have a set of <em>BRCA1</em> mutations that have been defined from studies in Caucasian female populations, but those variants might not be the same variants present in minority female populations, particularly people of African descent or African Americans. So how good is the <em>BRCA1</em> test for a community of African American patients? Probably not so good.</p>



<p>Then there’s the scientific imperative. Even if you don’t feel strongly about equality for equality’s sake, you can appreciate that for scientific reasons, we want to have as diverse a dataset as we can. That’s how we can really understand the universe of potential genetic variation and what it means.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What prevents that kind of diversity in current studies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> I think in the United States — and I can really speak only from my experience in the United States — it’s because of the history of racial and ethnic division in our country, and some of the crimes that have been perpetrated on specific groups, even in medical science. African Americans have lived through slavery. They’ve lived through Jim Crow. They’ve lived through Tuskegee. They’ve lived through Henrietta Lacks. And they’ve lived through, in their own lives, any number of discriminations at the hands of the medical system. It creates systemic distrust for many from the African American community that would make them hesitant to participate in scientific studies.</p>



<p>The Latino population may have different reasons. If you’re in the United States and you’re a recent immigrant who is not necessarily documented, you might not trust the establishment with your information. Or even if you are documented, you may not trust the establishment.</p>



<p>The Tuskegee study left a lot of psychological damage in certain communities. It’s created a severe mistrust that can often work counter to people’s overall health — the hesitancy to participate in genetic studies that could greatly benefit the community by driving developments in precision medicine, and even the hesitancy to take the vaccine for COVID-19. That distrust took hundreds of years to develop. We’re only in the last few decades really trying to do anything meaningful to address it.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What kind of work are you doing to overcome that distrust?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> Our goal at the Faith Based Genetic Research Institute is to build some of those trust bonds, particularly through communities of faith — African American churches, Latino churches and others who are meeting people where they are in a religious context. Our goal is also to share information about how precision medicine, gene therapy, gene editing and advanced technology are going to impact the medical field and impact people’s health and well-being, but through trusted sources who are folks from their community.</p>



<p>One of the strategies we employ is called the honest broker strategy; the people who are talking about the technology to the community are from the community. [We think about] who’s representing the science, who’s communicating the science, who’s telling you why you should participate. So I’m not bringing a bunch of white, male scientists into a community of African American and Latino churchgoers. I’m bringing in Black male and Black female scientists who are from the community.</p>



<p>It’s challenging because you don’t have as many scientists of color. There’s a training issue on that part. I think the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation and other organizations have done a good job of identifying the problem. I’m hoping that they will come up with some real tactical solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What kind of information do you share in these community meetings, and have you seen success?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> We have a preview lecture called DNA 101. We walk through, what is DNA? What is a mutation? What is a single nucleotide polymorphism, and how do they apply to health and disease? Why is it important for you to know what single nucleotide polymorphisms are? Because it’ll help you get a better idea of what diseases you’re predisposed to. And to give you a leg up on treatment.</p>



<p>That’s where we meet people. And we’ve had a lot of success. Generally after one of our in-person sessions — which we haven’t been able to do since COVID-19 — we’ve had a lot of interest from folks, some who came with questions and some who had never been approached about getting a genetic test before.</p>



<p>We have one grant called the <a href="https://www.genomes2people.org/research/peopleseq/">PeopleSeq Consortium</a> in partnership with places including the Broad Institute and Harvard University that surveys individuals’ attitudes toward participating in elective genetic testing. Before we joined the effort, the program had five African Americans who completed the survey and sent their samples for testing. After we got involved, that number increased to 50 within one year. Our work is making a difference, but we still have a long way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>Looking back at how far genetics research has come, where do you think it’s headed? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> There’s a research imperative to understand every genome, because all genomes matter. But we have to make sure that we go above and beyond what we’ve been doing to understand minority genomes, because minority genomes especially matter. They have not been studied. I think it is long overdue.</p>



<p>Science has long been the domain of the wealthy, who have been in positions to define the pace and the communities that get studied. We’ve got to get out of that. As a community, we’ve got to say, “No, that’s not in the best interest of science, and it’s not in the best interest of society.” So let’s really lean in and do it different.</p>



<p>I’m hopeful that newer generations of researchers — Caucasian and nonminority researchers — are realizing that and saying “Hey, look, we can’t do business as we did. We’re really going to try to open this up and diversify for the sake of science and the sake of society.”</p>
