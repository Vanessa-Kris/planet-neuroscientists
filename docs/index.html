                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5xvLOq1NVdQ/">The European Science Media Hub: A retrospective and Look Into the Future</a></h4>

<p><em>Note: This post was written by Vitalba Crivello, Policy Analyst, European Science Media Hub.</em></p>
<p>In an era of alternative facts and misinformation, the loss of public trust is not only a challenge for scientists, experts and the media, but also for policymakers and for society as a whole. Scientists often blame the media for incorrect reporting, while the media are critical of scientists’ ability to engage with the public. Citizens may feel confused by news headlines about scientific studies which can sometimes come to different, if not contradictory, conclusions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">European Science-Media Hub (ESMH)</a> was launched in June 2018 to help address these issues. The ESMH, operating under the political responsibility of the European Parliament’s Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA), acts as <strong>a centre for information, networking, education and training in science journalism</strong>. It is a platform promoting knowledge sharing between the European Parliament, the scientific community and the media.</p>
<p>Eighteen intense months have elapsed since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2018/06/28/the-european-science-media-hub-kick-off-event-communicating-science-via-social-media-june-27-2018/">initial meeting</a>, attended by PLOS among other members of the scientific community, European research organisations and journalists.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">ESMH website</a> was launched a year ago, 29<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-articles/"><strong> journalistic articles</strong></a> have been published, written in collaboration with journalists and scientists on topics including AI, new technologies, disinformation, communication and social sciences. Each article is accompanied by <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/interview/"><strong>interviews with experts</strong></a> (40 to date) and highlights related to <strong>EU-funded projects</strong>. <strong>Articles appear every second Wednesday, alternating with the </strong><a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/press-review/"><strong>ESMH Press Review “Two weeks of science”</strong></a> (22 issues to date) prepared by the ESMH team by tracking trending topics in the media.</p>
<p><strong>ESMH 2019 Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepared a series of <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/videos/"><strong>7 thematic videos</strong></a>, touching upon scientific topics of particular interest, dealt with by STOA during the 8th parliamentary term.</li>
<li>Organised <strong>thematic workshops for journalists</strong>, including ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/02/21/esmh-workshop-tackling-disinformation-and-misinformation-in-science/"><strong>Tackling dis/misinformation in Science</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised a workshop for the general public entitled ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/04/18/esmh-workshop-virality-and-influencers-in-digital-communication-april-3-2019/"><strong>Virality and influencers in digital communication</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/tag/eysmd2019/"><strong>the first edition of the European Youth Science-Media Days (EYSMD) – the ESMH summer school for young journalists “AI and journalism”</strong></a>. This was the first event of its kind, providing the 80 attendees with an overview of existing links between artificial intelligence (AI) and journalism.</li>
<li>More than 350 journalists, science communicators, and representatives of research organisations and EU institutions now regularly receive ESMH updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What’s on the radar for the Hub in 2020?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To strengthen networks, the ESMH is currently working in cooperation with the European Parliament Liaison Offices to organise a series of Science-Media events in some EU Member States, in the framework of the <strong>ESMH project on ‘Engagement of science journalists/communicators in ESMH activities’ </strong>(launched in 2019). The events have the dual purpose of raising awareness about the ESMH platform and exploring the different needs of media stakeholders in order to better adapt the ESMH offer for these communicators.</li>
<li>We are also enlarging our community of science writers via a devoted <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-call-for-expression-of-interest/">Call for Expression of Interest</a>.</li>
<li>We are upgrading our media intelligence technology to produce a richer version of the ESMH press review.</li>
<li>In May, we plan a series of website articles focused on the environment, in view of the second edition of the <strong>ESMH summer school, </strong>already under preparation<strong>. </strong>The event, entitled<strong> ‘Digital technologies for environmental sustainability’,</strong> will take place in Strasbourg in coordination with the broader <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/european-youth-event/en/eye2020/home.html">European Youth Event (EYE)</a>.</li>
<li>In June, another event in the pipeline for this summer is the ‘<strong>Science Week at the European Parliament</strong>’, which will be organised by STOA in Brussels and will be co-ordinated with the Directorate-General Research and Innovation of the European Commission, the European Research Council (ERC) and, possibly, the Joint Research Centre. The ESMH plans to replicate the experience of 2019 by organising a thematic workshop for journalists and a pitching session between journalists and researchers.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the ESMH is planning to hold sessions at two major international conferences: the International Journalism Festival (IJF) in Perugia (April 2020) and the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Trieste (July 2020).</li>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">If you confidently tell a young child a fact, they’re likely to believe you. But you’d better be right — because if they find out that you were wrong, and should have known better, they’ll doubt not only your credibility but your intelligence too. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">These are the implications of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227026"><span class="Hyperlink0"><span style="color: black;">new work</span></span></a> in <em>PLOS One</em><span class="None">, led by Susan Birch at the University of British Columbia. It shows that children prefer to learn from people who are consistently confident, rather than hesitant, about what they say. However, even kids as young as four also keep a track record of a person’s accuracy, and make judgements about them on this basis. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“We now know that children are even more savvy at learning from others than we previously thought,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/uobc-urr012420.php">says Birch</a>. “They don’t just prefer to learn from anyone who is confident; they avoid learning from people who have confidently given wrong information in the past.” </span></span><span id="more-39101"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The vast majority of the information that we learn in life comes from other people, note Birch and her colleagues. But as we all differ in intelligence and areas of expertise — and often offer opinions rather than facts — to learn best, children would benefit from working out whom to trust. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Obvious confidence in a statement can certainly be a cue to its credibility. This might be expressed verbally (by introducing a statement with “I know…” rather than “I think…”, for example) and also in body language (nodding versus shrugging, for instance) and gestures. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">However, confidence is not always a reliable guide to accuracy. (And to be clear, we’re talking about apparent confidence in a given statement, rather than confidence as a more general aspect of personality.) To optimise learning, we really need to identify people who are confident when it’s justified, and also hesitant when it’s justified — because they don’t really know the answer. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">To explore how this skill might develop, Birch and her colleagues ran three studies on 662 children. They used videos of actors </span></span><span lang="EN-US">showing “justified” confidence or hesitancy or “unjustified” confidence or hesitancy, and gauged the children’s opinions of these individuals. In each case, an actor was either allowed or not allowed to look inside a box, which contained pictures that the child could not see. The video showed them then being asked what was in the box, and their responses. For example, the “informed, justifiably confident” actor nodded and immediately said something like, “It’s a rabbit. I know it’s a rabbit. It’s a rabbit for sure.” The “informed, unjustifiably hesitant” actor, who had been allowed to look, shrugged and said, “Umm, it could be a puppy… hmm… maybe a puppy? I’ll guess a puppy.” The researchers then probed which of the actors the children would prefer to learn new words from, and who they thought was smarter. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">An initial study of children aged 3 to 12 found that from around the age of five, all preferred to learn from the justifiably confident individuals, and judged them as being smarter. <span class="None">To explore this further, the team then ran two follow-up studies on children aged 4 to 8. They used the same experimental design, but the first of the follow-ups directly compared responses to justified versus unjustified confidence, while the second looked only at justified and unjustified hesitancy.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The results were clear. From the age of four, all of the children placed more trust in the justifiably vs unjustifiably confident individuals. However, even the eight-year-olds failed to realise that someone who showed justified hesitancy (because they hadn’t been allowed to see inside the box) was more reliable than someone whose hesitancy was not justified (because they had indeed seen inside it). It seems, then, that sensitivity to this key clue to credibility takes much longer to develop. This delay might happen because a child’s brain is more wired to attend to clues than to misinformation, the researchers suggest. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“Taken together this set of experiments provides a more comprehensive demonstration of children’s complex and nuanced understanding of the mind while simultaneously illuminating specific limitations in their social cognitive understanding,” they write. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the real world, of course, children are rarely given the opportunity to make such immediate clear-cut judgements about an adult’s credibility, and few of us are always reliable, or always unreliable. But this work does suggest that if you don’t want even a young child to judge you harshly (and anyone who has kids knows that they can be pretty unforgiving judges), you should be clear about when you really know something for a fact — and when you don’t.</span></span></p>

<p>All kinds of animals use their bodies to signal a high social rank — humans included. But a growing body of research suggests that, for us at least, there are two distinct routes to becoming a leader. One entails earning respect and followers by demonstrating your knowledge and expertise, which confers prestige. An alternative strategy is to use aggression and intimidation to scare people into deference — that is, to use dominance instead.</p>
<p>These two ways to the top are very different. And, to get on with their leader, an inferior-status individual would have to respond to these two types of leadership differently, too. So, reasoned, Zachary Witkower and Jessica Tracy at the University of British Columbia, and colleagues, rather than a single human high rank, “power” display, perhaps there are two distinct patterns of non-verbal behaviour that communicate to other individuals exactly what kind of leader someone is.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-22179-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, reveals that this is indeed the case. This is important for understanding how we display rank, and perceive and respond to it. It could also explain why studies into <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">“power posing”</a> have produced conflicting results.</p>

<p>Earlier work has found that prestigious leaders — think Barack Obama, say — tend to be empathic and helpful towards their followers, and that their willingness to share their expertise with subordinates is crucial to their status. To maintain support and devotion from their followers, such a leader would, then, need to signal not only that they have a high status but that they are also warm, caring and pro-social. In contrast, dominance-type leaders (think no end of despots) would have to also signal their aggressiveness to maintain their status.</p>
<p>Across many species, sheer physical size — or making yourself look bigger — sends a high-status message. In people, an “expansive” posture, with arms and legs away from the body, and the chest puffed out (which is associated with pride) has been linked to high-status, too. The team reasoned that both prestige and dominance leaders would use these postures, but that a downward head tilt (which other work has shown is intimidating) and no smile would signal dominance, while an upward head tilt and a smile would signal prestige.</p>
<p>Four studies that involved presenting US-based adults with either computer-generated avatars or photos of actors adopting various poses provided good evidence for this theory — raters did indeed separately associate prestige and dominance with these two distinct displays. The researchers also noted that there were no gender differences in the participants’ judgements.</p>
<p>For the fifth study, 191 students who didn’t know each other were assigned to 36 same-gender groups. They completed a decision-making test individually, and then were videoed while they worked on this same task in their group. Afterwards, each participant rated each of the others in their group for prestige, dominance, social influence and liking. Separately, two research assistants who watched the videos rated each for social influence. Independent coders also noted the presence, and intensity, of prestige or dominance displays in the videos.</p>
<p>The team found that students who adopted more obvious prestige displays were given higher prestige ratings. Also, anyone who displayed prestige was consistently judged to have exerted more influence over the group.</p>
<p>The results on dominance were a little more mixed: those rated higher for dominance indeed adopted more expansive stances, but were no more likely to tilt their head downwards or not smile.</p>
<p>The researchers also noted, however, a difference between the expansive postures used by those rated high for prestige vs dominance: prestige was associated with more chest expansion, whereas dominant students spread their limbs more — which could have the effect of making them seem more invasive of other people’s personal space.</p>
<p>For their final study, the team turned to videos of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump — leaders taken to exemplify prestige and dominance strategies, respectively — during the 2016 presidential debates. Independent raters found that Clinton indeed engaged in more smiling and upward head tilting than Trump, who engaged in more downward head tilting. Also, Clinton displayed relatively more chest expansion, but Trump occupied more space, and extended his arms out from his body more.</p>
<p>Together, these studies “provide strong converging evidence that dominance and prestige are associated with distinct nonverbal signals which naturally emerge in ecologically valid group settings and real-world rank contests, and result in rank conferral from others,” the team writes.</p>
<p>The work could also help to explain inconsistencies from studies that have looked at non-verbal behaviour in relation to social rank, but not made the distinction between prestige and dominance. Given the difference that the team observed in the physical stance associated with prestige vs dominance, this might have implications for understanding power posing (which involves a combination of the two), the researchers write. “Regardless of what the future holds for power posing, researchers who seek to test this account should more rigorously consider the specific make up of the behaviours involved in the pose,” they write.</p>

<p>Dementia has now overtaken cancer as the most feared disease for people aged over 65, and with good reason. The cognitive changes and memory impairment can cause significant distress. Since around a third of people aged eighty-five and over have dementia, most people will know someone with this condition.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I’m asked is what dementia actually <em>is.</em> I say that dementia is an umbrella term that means a progressive loss of memory and thinking that leads to a decline in function. This means people losing the ability to do things they used to be able to do well, whether it’s cooking or managing complex spreadsheets.</p>
<p>There are many different diseases that cause dementia, but the most common ones are Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia and these are also the ones that are most responsive to lifestyle change.</p>
<p>These are my top ten tips for reducing the risk of dementia.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Nutrition</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389">Predimed</a> trial was conducted in Spain and recruited thousands of people to look at a <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the-mediterranean-diet/">Mediterranean</a> diet, which was high in vegetables, legumes and fish, with minimal refined carbohydrates. 447 of those people were recruited to an additional study where they had a cognitive assessment, then divided into three groups. One group were on the control low-fat diet, one group had extra olive oil, the other group had extra nuts. For the groups supplemented with olive oil or nuts, there was a slowing in the rate of cognitive decline.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a population based study of 191 women in Sweden, a higher level of fitness in midlife was associated with a much lower risk of dementia. The women were given an exercise test in 1968, then over the years they had detailed cognitive assessments. When the results were analysed, 44 years after the study started, 15% of the least fit women had dementia compared to 0% of the fittest. Of course this is a small study, and exercise won’t get rid of all the risk, but it’s pretty inspiring to hit the gym.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After even one night of poor sleep, our brains are not functioning at the optimal level, so it’s not surprising that poor sleep in the long term is very bad for cognition. While we sleep, our brains perform critical housekeeping tasks, including consolidating memories and getting rid of the day’s garbage. Both short and long sleep duration are predictive of dementia, with sleeping less than 6 hours or more than 8 hours being a risk. These studies are complicated to interpret, because sleep disturbance is frequently an early sign of dementia, so this could be a sign of the disease rather than the cause. There are many <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/10_tips_for_better_sleep/">evidence based lifestyle strategies to improve sleep</a> and personally I’m going to continue to enjoy being well-rested rather than find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Manage stress and mental illness</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Depression and dementia have an interesting relationship. One of the challenges of diagnosing dementia is that many of the early symptoms mimic depression, like apathy and a lack of interest in activities that someone usually enjoys. Depression and anxiety can also impair memory function. While the question of whether depression causes dementia is still to be answered, it is concerning that people with moderate to severe dementia have reduced hippocampal volume, a key brain structure for memory. Chronic stress can also alter cortisol release and may influence inflammation. If you are feeling overwhelmed, or experiencing a low mood, it is a good idea to see your doctor to look at a treatment plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Avoid alcohol and cigarettes</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While 1 or 2 glasses of wine a few days a week is unlikely to do harm, in larger amounts alcohol is very bad for the brain and can cause dementia. Alcohol is freely able to cross the blood brain barrier and can cause damage to brain cells. Similarly, smoking is linked with systemic inflammation and poor blood vessel health, and our brains are highly dependent on blood flow to function properly.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Keep your blood vessels healthy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the brain is an energy-hungry organ that relies on a good blood supply, it makes sense that healthy blood vessels are good for the brain. There are three important and treatable factors that your doctor can check for: diabetes, high blood pressure and high levels of unhealthy fats in the blood. These are all bad for blood vessels and over time can compromise blood supply to the brain. Seeing your GP for regular check-ups can ensure these are picked up early and are treated.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Keep your brain busy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While many people look forward to retirement, for some people this is associated with a decline in cognitive function. Of course, it is also possible people are retiring (or being retired) because there is already a decline, but for many people work is actually very good for their brains. While ‘brain training’ apps have become increasingly popular, there is no convincing evidence they prevent or slow dementia. While practising a brain training app will help you to get better at the brain training app, this won’t necessarily translate to helping with day-to-day function, so it’s important to find activities to challenge yourself and incorporate them into life.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2>Get your hearing checked</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hearing loss increases with age, and poor hearing is a risk factor for dementia. While it is important to protect your hearing by trying to avoid too much exposure to loud noise, it is also important to have a hearing check and to get treatment. While there is still insufficient evidence to prove hearing aids will reduce the risk of dementia, these can improve the quality of life and overcome a barrier to participating in social settings.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2>A sense of purpose</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most interesting studies I’ve come across took a cohort of older adults and tested their cognitive function and asked about whether they felt their life had purpose and meaning. After these people died, the researchers did an autopsy on their brains to look for changes consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. People with <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the_power_of_purpose/">a higher sense of purpose</a> had a higher level of cognitive function while they were alive, and this sense of purpose was still protective even if they had changes in their brain consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2>Social and emotional connection</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Levels of social connection across life are linked with higher rates of dementia. This might be because loneliness is a stress state for social animals like us, that can lead to increased cortisol release and inflammation. Social activity is also excellent for adding enjoyment to life, so maintaining connection or making some new friends is a great way to protect your brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are worried about your own memory, or someone you love, it is really important to get it checked out. Sometimes there are reversible causes of cognitive decline, like B12 deficiency, low levels of thyroid hormone or severe depression. If it is the beginning of cognitive decline, it is also helpful to know so you can plan for ways to stay healthy and independent for as long as possible.</p>
<p>One incredibly reassuring fact is that while the number of people with dementia is rising as most people reach very old age, the risk is actually decreasing. This means that you probably have a lower risk of dementia than your parents at the same age. Incorporating these ten strategies, and the risk might be lower yet!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></h4>

<p>Imagine that you’ve just been appointed the head of operations for a five-star hotel in Manhattan. Your boss calls you in her office on your first day and says: “Our biggest problem is how slow elevators are. Everyone complains about it, and we can’t have that. Speed them up.”</p><p>How would you do it?</p><p>Most people intuitively focus on speeding up the elevators: installing stronger motors, modifying the dispatch algorithm, getting the doors to shut faster, or even installing additional elevators. But there is also a whole set of options that consists of giving the impression that the elevators are faster, for instance by distracting the users with windows or, on the cheaper side, with mirrors, TVs, or newspapers.</p><p>Facing a complex challenge, it’s tempting to pursue whichever option we first identify and start implementing it quickly. But <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-big-idea-before-you-make-that-big-decision">relying on this kind of intuitive thinking, particularly</a><u> </u>in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">unpredictable</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">environments</a><u>, </u>might result in poor outcomes —<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19739881">even when we have a high degree of confidence</a>.</p><p>Instead, we should first identify the range of solutions that are available to us, which is challenging, because we don’t know what we don’t know. It’s like being an explorer a few hundred years ago who would land on an uncharted piece of land having to decide how to explore it. Well, there is a time-tested approach: map it.</p><p>Facing that complex challenge, your first task should be to frame your problem in the form of an overarching question that, once answered, will lay out your proposed plan of action. A good way to frame your problem is to summarize that key question and its context in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/frame-with-a-situation-complication-question-sequence/">a situation- complication-question sequence</a><u>. </u>Once you’ve framed your problem, you should then think of alternative ways—or options—to solve it before deciding which one is on balance the best.</p><p>A question map<em> </em>helps you explore that universe of potential options. Question maps are similar to other knowledge cartography tools, such as mind maps, decision trees, and the issue trees that management consultants use. But question maps are also different from these tools in that they obey their own rules, four rules that actively drive structure into your problem-solving process.</p><p><strong>1. Good question maps answer a single type of question</strong></p><p>The first rule of good question maps is that they answer a single type of question. Facing a complex problem, we face two types of questions: why and how. A why question is problem centric; it helps you to diagnose your problem, uncovering its root causes and, ultimately, enabling you to summarize your problem in a more insightful key question. In contrast, a how question is solution centric: It enables you to consider all the possible solutions to your problem.</p><p>One type of question isn’t consistently better than the other. Both are useful and, in general, you want to ask why before you ask how.</p><p><strong>2. Good question maps go from the question to potential options</strong></p><p>The second rule of good question maps is just as simple: Start your map at your key question and explore all possible answers—the so-called solution space. This requires you to think in a divergent pattern. Vertically, use your map to uncover the various facets of your question, with each branch addressing a different dimension. Horizontally, use your map to go into more details eventually identifying concrete, tangible answers.</p><p>So, if your question is how you should make your clients happy with the speed of your elevators, you might start a map with two ideas: “by speeding up the elevators” and “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster.” You can then continue exploring these ideas into further and further details.</p><p>You should continue that divergent thinking pattern as long as doing so brings value. This will typically result in a map with dozens of ideas over at least five layers. For a why question, this progression in further depth is equivalent to the five-whys methodology—but don’t limit yourself to just five, if it makes sense to drill deeper, do so. Since it would be intractable to treat each one of these ideas as a separate option, you then converge by summarizing your entire map in a set of two to ten formal options.</p><p><strong>3. Good question maps have a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive structure</strong></p><p>Next, consider all the possible answers to your question exactly once. That is, give your map branches that are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/be-mece/">mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1"></a> (or MECE<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2"></a>). Giving your map this structure is a critical element of the process, and in most cases, it isn’t easy to do, as it requires you to think both creatively and critically. So, expect to spend some effort here—and by “expect to spend some effort,” I mean that if you don’t feel some frustration, you’re not doing it well!</p><p><strong>4. Good question maps are insightful</strong></p><p>The final rule of good maps is that they should have an insightful structure. That is, the structure should be both logically valid and useful. Concretely, this means finding a way to structure the map that helps bring some new, useful light into your question. This is especially important for the first cut, the top-most node of the map.</p><p>Striving to be insightful also means that you need to keep developing your map until you identify concrete answers. Don’t stay at a philosophical level (e.g., by just writing “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster”) but identify concrete ways to answer your question (“by installing mirrors in the elevators”).</p><p><img height="899" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png" width="1541" /></p><p> </p><p>Question maps only have four rules, and those are simple enough to understand. Following them when solving a complex problem, however, can be, let’s say, challenging. But realize that the complexity isn’t in the map; the complexity is in the problem, all that the map does is expose that complexity so that you can better address it. So, embrace the challenge, and happy mapping!</p><p><em>Feature image by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/8Q6aHbve5hI">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/617935874/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f02%2fhow-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/using-math-to-understand-inequity/" rel="nofollow">Using math to understand inequity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/the-problem-with-overqualified-research/" rel="nofollow">The problem with overqualified research</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/does-consciousness-have-a-function/" rel="nofollow">Does Consciousness Have a Function?</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>Recent years have seen a proliferation of mental health apps that claim to help relieve symptoms of depression. But there’s not much evidence that they really do anything,</strong> <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/02/do-mental-health-apps-do-any-good/">writes Tom Chivers at <em>Unherd</em></a>. Even in the few cases where there has been research into the effectiveness of the apps, the studies are often small and uncontrolled, raising questions about how solid the results are.</p>

<p><strong>Ever felt like pop songs are getting sadder? Well, you’re not wrong,</strong> <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-are-pop-songs-getting-sadder-than-they-used-to-be">according to researchers Alberto Acerbi and Charlotte Brand</a>, writing at <em>Aeon</em>. The pair analysed more than 150,000 songs released between 1965 and 2015, scanning the lyrics for words related to positive and negative emotions. Over the years there was an increase in the use of negative words, and decrease in positive ones. The team suggests that this is a result of “cultural evolution”: songs with negative emotion words tended to be more popular, and so in subsequent years songs contained even more negative lyrics.</p>

<p><strong>Could war crimes be prevented if the military were to screen recruits for specific personality traits?</strong> In <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-we-discovered-a-personality-profile-linked-to-war-crimes-130622">researchers Magnus Linden and David Whetham report </a>that elements of the “dark triad” of personality traits were found to be related to unethical behaviour among peacekeepers. “It may be inevitable that atrocities happen in war”, they write. “But that doesn’t mean that some, or even many, ethical violations could not be prevented. To do this, we have to take more notice of the evidence that we have available.”</p>

<p><strong>Concerns about the effects of smartphones and other technologies are increasingly in the headlines. But what does the evidence say? </strong>Amy Orben, research fellow at the University of Cambridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/01/amy-orben-psychology-smartphones-affecting-brain-social-media-teenagers-mental-health">talks to <em>The Guardian</em></a> about her research into digital technology and the wellbeing of young people. We talked to Amy in our latest PsychCrunch podcast — if you haven’t heard it yet, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">check it out here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And when it comes to concerns about technology, there are also matters of race and privilege to consider.</strong> In <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/teachers-less-likely-to-take-phones-away-from-white-privileged-children-120810">Emeline Brulé and Matt Rafalow report</a> the results of their study looking at the way teachers from different schools perceive students’ use of digital technology. Teachers from a private school with mainly white students tended to see technology use as beneficial to the kids’ education, while those at schools with more marginalised students were more likely to perceive it as simply “messing around”.</p>

<p><strong>We already knew that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/10/good-at-heart-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-better-side-of-humanity/">toddlers can be surprisingly selfless</a> — but a new study has found that even babies as young as 19 months display altruistic behaviour. </strong>Babies willingly gave a piece of fruit to an adult who clearly wanted it but was unable to reach it, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/altruistic-infants-wellness/indhttps:/edition.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/altruistic-infants-wellness/index.htmlex.html">report Sandee LaMotte and Kristen Rogers</a> at <em>CNN</em> — even at meal times, when they themselves were hungry.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, a viral tweet questioning whether we all have an inner monologue led to <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/what-does-your-internal-monologue-say-about-your-mental-health-21777794">this story</a> in <em>Mic</em> from Tracey Anne Duncan.</strong> Psychologists agree we all have “self-talk”, Duncan writes, but this doesn’t have to involve words — it also includes imagery and sensations. And what’s less clear is exactly how the content of that self-talk reflects our mental health. (Whether we all hear a voice in our head when we <em>read</em> is another question — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/">something we covered</a> back in 2016).</p>

<p>For people with painful or disruptive symptoms, a medical diagnosis can have emotional and tangible benefits such as peace of mind from having a ‘known cause’ of the symptoms, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738399118308838" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social support</a>, access to funded services, and <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0265-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">knowledge of treatment options</a>. But diagnostic labels can also have harms, such as <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.153775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">levels of distress</a>, a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-and-cognitive-psychotherapy/article/an-experimental-investigation-of-the-impact-of-personality-disorder-diagnosis-on-clinicians-can-we-see-past-the-borderline/4A2E43B72792EEB68C497CF95ABBA0D7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change in perceived control over one’s own health</a>, and <a href="https://www.healio.com/nursing/journals/rgn/2009-4-2-2/%7B4db0b00a-5889-4996-923d-b00767e2327a%7D/diagnostic-labels-stigma-and-participation-in-research-related-to-dementia-and-mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reductions to health service access</a>. All diagnostic labels have different benefits and harms for different groups, but the harms are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11017-017-9412-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly an issue for people with no symptoms</a> – they may experience the harms with no benefit. This can happen when we screen for diseases before symptoms are felt, such screening for vitamin D deficiency or the current thought to screen all adolescents for depression.</p>
<p>Where expert panels draw the arbitrary line between ‘disease’ and ‘no disease’, or diagnosis and no diagnosis, requires <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2626860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">careful balancing</a> of these harms and benefits. An example of a change to the threshold for diagnosis, which has caused a global difference in how women experience their pregnancy, is in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). GDM is a diagnosis some otherwise healthy pregnant women receive when they are found to have elevated blood sugar (glucose). In 2010, the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) changed their <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/33/3/676.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diagnostic threshold and testing procedure for GDM</a>, which over the past decade has been accepted at different times by some countries and not at all by others. This change now includes as GDM more cases that had previously been considered borderline or not GDM. Although this expert panel selected this new diagnostic threshold with the best of intentions about possible benefits, they did not consider the harms of a GDM diagnosis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What do women tell us about the impacts of GDM on their lives?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are numerous interview studies that examined the psychosocial impact on women of a diagnosis of GDM. In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2745-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new systematic review</a> of these important studies, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, we present the first synthesis of the psychosocial benefits and harms of a GDM diagnosis.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11665 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/the-meter-3357128-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>We synthesized the results of 41 qualitative studies and found eight overarching themes: psychological impact, communication, knowledge, risk perception, management, burden, social support, and control. For example, when initially diagnosed, GDM was viewed both positively and negatively. Some women considered it a life-altering experience and a chance to positively intervene to reduce potential adverse outcomes for themselves and their babies:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘GDM was a hidden blessing for me … GDM can go away after you have the baby but diabetes is not so easily fixable … I am much more aware of [the] need to prevent it.’</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, most women reported reactions such as self-blame, failure, fear, sadness, concern and confusion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘I was very surprised and very upset to be diagnosed. I felt a little bit of a failure.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Because it is really ugly to have, in fact I wanted to have another baby and since I got this I do not want to anymore.’</em></p>
<p>Some women also talked about the burden of having a diagnosis of GDM and that communication about the condition was lacking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘The whole pressure with the whole everything, it really did affect me and I think it’s probably one of the worst times I’ve had in my life actually.</em>’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Like they don’t have time to sit there and talk to you about what to do about it [GDM], but they are always in a hurry [… ] so I just don’t bring it up and they don’t bring it up; so you just get checked out and leave.’</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is this important?</strong></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/33/3/676.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence used by IADPSG</a> to determine the new threshold between a diagnosis of GDM and no diagnosis was based on a positive (and continuous) association between blood glucose levels and physical harms to babies such as the risk of the baby being big for gestational age, excess infant fat, and maternal insulin levels. These potential consequences focused on physical harms to mother and baby but there was no evidence of physical benefits to mothers or babies if the threshold changed and none for psychosocial harms and benefits for the mother. Understanding the full range of harms and benefits of a diagnosis of GDM is critical before any <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2626860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changes to definitions</a> should be made.</p>
<blockquote><p>…consequences of a diagnosis of GDM go beyond the potential physical risks to mothers and babies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results are clear that consequences of a diagnosis of GDM go beyond the potential physical risks to mothers and babies. <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023293.abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research</a> <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jog.13544" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence</a> is also <a href="http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2016/2670912.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accumulating</a> that the change in GDM definition has increased the number of women diagnosed with GDM but may not be having a significant impact on decreasing the physical consequences. In addition to the clinical outcomes already considered, more attention should be paid to the consequences of GDM that women themselves consider important.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Three potential solutions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disease definition panels should have a population focus.</strong> Expert panel groups are composed of clinicians working in tertiary environments where they encounter a significant proportion of clinical/physical harms. These then tend to dominate their world view.

<p><em>By guest blogger </em>Dan Carney</p>
<p>One of the most well-known psychological biases is the Dunning-Kruger effect: the tendency for individuals less skilled or knowledgeable in a particular area to overestimate their own performance. Now, a team of researchers from Miami University, Ohio, have offered the most robust evidence yet that this may apply to knowledge about autism — that what people think they know about the condition may not be that closely related to what they actually know.<br />
<span id="more-39071"></span></p>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946719301874">March issue of <em>Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders</em></a>, the authors — led by Camilla McMahon — measured perceived and actual autism knowledge in a sample of 331 members of the US public, with a range of incomes and educational backgrounds.</p>
<p>Participants’ perception of their own knowledge was assessed using the specially created Perceived Autism Knowledge Questionnaire, consisting of six statements regarding symptoms (e.g. “I can recognise the signs and symptoms of autism”). Participants were required to respond to each on a scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”.</p>
<p>Actual knowledge was measured with the Autism Symptomatology Knowledge Assessment, a list of 25 symptoms — ten specific to autism (e.g. “failure to initiate or respond to social interactions”), and fifteen to other conditions (e.g. “depressed mood”) — each requiring a yes/no response regarding whether it can be used to make an autism diagnosis. Lastly, participants estimated both their own score, and their performance in comparison with others, on the actual knowledge measure.</p>
<p>Strikingly, no correlation was found between performance on the perceived and actual autism knowledge measures: people’s beliefs about their own knowledge were not related to their actual knowledge levels. In addition, participants with the highest actual knowledge levels were more likely to underestimate both their own scores on that measure, and their performance in comparison with others. The opposite pattern was found for those with the lowest actual knowledge, who tended to overestimate both their scores and their comparative performance.</p>
<p>The manner of the separation between perceived and actual knowledge suggests that autism knowledge may be prey to the Dunning-Kruger effect, which could have real-world implications. For instance, lower-knowledge individuals working with autistic people may not only provide inferior support due to lesser knowledge, but also — due to higher self-confidence — fail to correct themselves or try to improve. According to McMahon and her team, future research should examine specific professional groups (e.g. paediatricians or teachers), where a combination of high perceived and low actual knowledge may lead to errors in areas such as diagnosis and intervention.</p>
<p>And if more knowledgeable individuals are underestimating both their own absolute and relative knowledge of autism, this suggests that they may be overestimating the knowledge of others. This could also lead to inferior provision in professional contexts, as it may cause knowledgeable individuals to defer to others who do not share their level of expertise</p>
<p>The results also have implications for autism researchers: McMahon and colleagues point out that studies of autism awareness have often treated measures of perceived and actual knowledge interchangeably, when attempting to assess the latter. They recommend that researchers should bear the distinction in mind in future, and consider more carefully which of the two they wish to examine.</p>
<p>One limitation of the study, which the authors acknowledge, was that the measures were administered as part of a larger investigation that required participants to read a brief educational statement on autism and then answer questions on their own judgements of, and receptivity to, individuals with the condition. This process may have temporarily inflated knowledge levels and affected responses on the measures.</p>
<p>Overall, however, this study is the most detailed investigation to date of the Dunning-Kruger effect in autism, and provides an intriguing platform for further work. It suggests that initiatives to increase autism knowledge may need to be targeted at those who do not think of themselves as needing support, and should also aim to enhance people’s awareness of their own knowledge level.</p>
<p>Understanding the way that people perceive their knowledge relative to others could also inform situations in which those from different professional fields (e.g. teachers, social workers or educational psychologists) are required to reach joint decisions on provision for autistic people. This may enable better collaborative judgements, made by professionals able to gauge their own expertise level – and that of those around them – more accurately.</p>

<p>When you can’t quite put your finger on how you’re feeling, don’t worry — there may be a non-English word that can help you out. There are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/28/there-are-at-least-216-foreign-words-for-positive-emotional-states-and-concepts-that-we-dont-have-in-english/">hundreds of words</a> across the world for emotional states and concepts, from the Spanish word for the desire to eat simply for the taste (<em>gula</em>) to the Sanskrit for revelling in someone else’s joy (<em>mudita</em>).</p>
<p>But what about those words that exist across many languages — “anger”, for example, or “happiness”? Do they mean the same thing in every language, or do we experience emotions differently based on the culture we are brought up in? Is the experience we call “love” in English emotionally analogous with its direct translation into Hungarian, “szerelem”, for example?</p>
<p><span id="more-39062"></span></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">new paper in </a><em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">Science</a>,</em> Joshua Conrad Jackson from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <span>and colleagues l</span><span>ooked at 2,439 distinct concepts (including 24 relating to emotion) from 2,474 languages. The team analysed the similarities and differences between languages based on patterns of “colexification”: instances in which multiple concepts are expressed by the same word form.</span></p>
<p>In Persian, to use the team’s example, the word <em>ænduh</em> can be used to express both grief and regret; in the Dargwa dialect, spoken in Dagestan in Russia, <em>dard</em> means grief and anxiety. It follows, therefore, that Persian speakers may understand grief as closer to regret, and Dargwa speakers closer to anxiety.</p>
<p>The analysis allowed the researchers to create networks of concepts that showed, for each language family, how closely different emotional concepts related to each other. These revealed wide variation between language families. For instance, in Tad-Kadai languages, which can be found in Southeast Asia, southern China, and Northeast India, “anxiety” was related to “fear”; in Austroasiatic languages, anxiety was closer to “grief” or “regret”. In Nakh Daghestanian languages spoken mainly in parts of Russia, on the other hand, “anger” was related to “envy”, but in Austronesian languages it was related to “hate”, “bad”, and “proud”.</p>
<p>But there were some similarities. Words with the same emotional valence — i.e. that were positive or negative — tended to be associated only with other words of the same valence, in all language families across the world. Happiness, for example, was linked to other positive emotions, even if the specific associations were slightly different depending on the language family. (This wasn’t always the case though: in some Austronesian languages, “pity” and “love” were associated, suggesting pity may be more positive or love more negative than in other languages). Similarly, low-arousal emotions like sadness were also unlikely to be compared to high-arousal emotions like anger.</p>
<p>And geography also seemed to matter: language families that were geographically closer tended to share more similar associations than those that were far away.</p>
<p>The study’s findings suggest that emotional concepts do vary between languages up to a point, raising the question of just how similar supposedly universal experiences are. Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly how somebody else is experiencing the world, and language can often be woefully inadequate when it comes to expressing our internal life. And while the research suggests that those emotional experiences may vary in subtle ways across the world, deep down it seems we’re not so dissimilar at all.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk talk about the paper "Hyperbolic geometry of the olfactory space".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the natural environment, the sense of smell, or olfaction, serves to detect
toxins and judge nutritional content by taking advantage of the associations
between compoundsas they are created in biochemical reactions. This suggests
that the nervous system can classify odors based on statistics of their
co-occurrence within natural mixtures rather than from the chemical structures
of the ligands themselves. We show that this statistical perspective makes
it possible to map odors to points in a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic coordinates
have a long but often underappreciated history of relevance to biology. For
example, these coordinates approximate the distance between species computed
along dendrograms and, more generally, between points within hierarchical
tree–like networks. We find that both natural odors and human perceptual
descriptions of smells can be described using a three-dimensional hyperbolic
space. This match in geometries can avoid distortions that would otherwise
arise when mapping odors to perception.</p>

An investigation into the director of the museum at Michigan State University has found him guilty of research misconduct and other behavior stemming from his meddling in efforts to repatriate a 500-year-old mummy of a young girl that came to the school from South America in the late 19th century.  A committee at the East … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/05/michigan-state-committee-finds-misconduct-by-museum-head-in-celebrated-mummy-case/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Michigan State committee finds misconduct by museum head in celebrated mummy case</span></a>

<p>Emotions have a powerful part to play in both our behavioural choices and our health. Experiencing a range of positive emotions has been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/14/positive-emodiversity-experiencing-a-variety-of-positive-emotions-plays-an-important-role-in-bodily-health/">associated with lower levels of inflammation</a>, for example, and emotional control has even been linked <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/28/these-are-the-pre-match-emotional-control-strategies-that-higher-ranked-table-tennis-players-use-more-than-lower-ranked-players/">to higher performance in sportspeople</a>. Negative emotions, too, can have a serious impact on behaviour: research has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/20/is-self-disgust-the-emotional-trigger-that-leads-to-self-harm/">investigated the emotional triggers of self-harm</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>Now new research from Charles Dorison and colleagues at Harvard University, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/2/943">published in <em>PNAS</em></a>, has looked at the role of negative emotions in addiction. Though some theories say negative mood in general is associated with problematic substance use, the study suggests that, for tobacco at least, it’s sadness <em>per se</em> that is related to addiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-39056"></span></p>
<p>For their first study, the team looked at data from a national survey that tracked 10,685 people over 20 years. It found that sadness significantly predicted smoking status — something that no other emotion, positive or negative, did. There seemed to be a long-term effect, too: sadness reported at the first phase of the data predicted smoking ten and twenty years later.</p>
<p>In the second study, which looked at cravings for cigarettes, 425 smokers were placed into three conditions: sadness, disgust and neutral. Those in the sadness condition were shown a clip from the notoriously tear-jerking Pixar film <em>Up</em>, and were then asked to write about a time they themselves had experienced significant loss, like the elderly man in the film.</p>
<p>Participants in the disgust condition were shown another iconic film clip: the scene from <em>Trainspotting</em> in which Ewan McGregor roots around in a decidedly unclean toilet. They were then asked to write about an unsanitary experience in their own life. And in the neutral condition, participants viewed a video about furniture making and were asked to write about their work.</p>
<p>Before and after watching the clips, participants were asked three questions about how much they were craving cigarettes — and, once again, sadness was related to tobacco use. Sadness increased craving compared to both the neutral and disgusted states, the latter of which appeared to decrease cravings (perhaps rather unsurprisingly, although the effect wasn’t statistically significant).</p>
<p>A third study again looked at cravings, asking 760 participants to watch either neutral or sad videos, and then indicate whether they’d prefer to have a few puffs of a cigarette immediately, or wait to have more puffs after a small delay. Those in the sadness condition were far more impatient, craving fewer puffs sooner than those in the neutral condition.</p>
<p>And in a final study, 158 smokers were asked to abstain from smoking for at least eight hours, with their breath verified through a carbon monoxide test. Participants were again asked to watch either a sad or neutral video. They then smoked a cigarette through a device that measures volume, speed and duration of puffs. Mirroring previous results, smokers in the sadness condition were both more impatient and smoked more per puff.</p>
<p>Though the findings certainly do present a strong argument for an emotion-specific model for smoking cessation, there were things left unaddressed. Only one of the experimental studies looked at other negative emotions (i.e. disgust, induced by watching the <em>Trainspotting </em>clip). Concluding that sadness is more potent than other negative emotional states may be too strong a statement — we have no idea how anxiety, fear or anger, for example, could trigger tobacco use.</p>
<p>It may also be worth conducting further research on the link between negative emotions and other addictive substances: the relationship between sadness and heroin use, for example, may be entirely different.</p>
<p>But encouraging people to give up smoking is not an insignificant health intervention: in both the US and the UK, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, and one billion more premature deaths worldwide are expected to occur because of smoking by the end of the century.  Understanding that, for many, smoking is not just habit-based but is deeply entwined with emotions may be a good way to develop anti-smoking programmes that work for everyone.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617533986/0/oupblogpsychology/">Using math to understand inequity</a></h4>

<p>What can math tell us about unfairness? Bias, discrimination, and inequity are phenomena that are deeply complex, context sensitive, personal, and intersectional. The mathematical modeling of social scenarios, on the other hand, is a practice that necessitates simplification. Using models to understand what happens in our social realm means representing the complex with something much less complex in order to study it.</p><p>Nonetheless, when used carefully models can help us learn about deep patterns related to inequity, including those that govern how unfair norms and patterns of behavior emerge in groups of people.   They are especially useful in highlighting spaces of possibility.   What might happen in the complex dynamics of the social realm?   Once we answer this question, we can use experiments and experimental studies to learn more about these possibilities.</p><p>In recent work by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-017-1487-8">fellow modelers</a> and myself, we’ve looked in particular at what minority status means for patterns of unfair behavior.   Suppose you are part of a company where people work together, but are still figuring out some of the social rules for how this is done.  Suppose further that men make up the majority of workers and women the minority.  And lastly suppose, as argued by Cecilia L. Ridgeway in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/framed-by-gender-9780199755783"><em>Framed by Gender</em></a><em>,</em> that like most humans your coworkers notice gender, and use it to shape their interactions with others in ways that can be subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle).  In a case like this, even without gender biases coming into play, women can end up disadvantaged.</p><p>The basic mechanism for this disadvantage relates to the speed with which people learn to interact with others.  Say that men make up 90% of office workers, and women 10%.   This means that 90% of the time women will be interacting with their “out-group”, while men will be doing the same thing only 10% of the time.  We can reasonably expect that women figure out how to treat men in the office more quickly than the reverse.  This is a general observation about minority status, majority members are, on average, exposed to the other group less, and so learn about them less quickly.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/100/2/593.short">Evolutionary biologists have shown</a> that when it comes to mutualistic interactions between species, sometimes the species that evolves more quickly ends up at a disadvantage simply by dint of this quick evolution.   This is

starting with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-017-1487-8">the work of Justin Bruner</a>, it has become clear <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2017.1335723?casa_token=XCCUFW32j0AAAAAA%3AgtFFyQjpNe_MF8aFFylQqSrKpOniqgbC52wAQu-8FmRwYVf1Nl6MM-WAPl_F8SC2oNFBLvAz_zTjXQ">that a similar thing might happen in the cultural realm</a>.  How?</p><p>When it comes to joint action – doing a project together, or forming a company, or running a household – a bargain of a sort is needed to figure out who does how much labor, and who gets what rewards.  The bargain need not be explicit, but somehow the issue must be settled.  In general, accommodating demands tend to be safe ones in bargains.  If you accommodate, usually your partner will be satisfied.  When individuals are quickly learning to bargain with another group, this means that in many cases they quickly move towards accommodation.  (Think, “don’t worry, I’ll finish the memo” or “I’ll stay to finish cleaning up”.)  Once this happens, the majority group can more slowly learn to take advantage of this accommodating behavior by demanding a lot of their partners.</p><p>Under other conditions, small groups can actually gain an advantage by learning quickly.  This depends on the details of the kind of interaction they are engaged it.   <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2017.1335723?casa_token=tHKpgYMp7ogAAAAA%3AjqZ1MnA5A_DtCztagI8J0d5gsUcQ6Lg8svltSoj-ar0c_97uwYUJXfFW3yJqAAwAmo58JsnKc2DARg">I’ve argued, though</a>, that in many real-world cases we should expect conditions to hold that will disadvantage minority groups, including those with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02691728.2018.1555870?casa_token=W6XigWXJPkYAAAAA%3AWBeXM5luOtXR7LaO8g_BEgKb8eU-ugrQdhoynEVYFw2dIxevMAd_dASgp7rtLExLmC1dXYdMHGPF">intersectional identities</a>.</p><p>Of course, much discriminatory behavior is more nefarious than this.  It often involves racial, gender, or other biases against members of certain social groups.  Given what we’d found in our models, though, my collaborators and I began to wonder whether this simple mechanism – based only on group size and learning speed – could lead to disadvantage for real humans.</p><p>We asked experimental subjects to engage in bargaining interactions between two groups.  One group was smaller than the other, but otherwise the two groups were completely identical.  After having the groups learn to interact with each other, we checked to see how much money they had earned through their bargaining.  <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-019-02424-1">We found that</a>, on average, the smaller groups earned significantly less, perhaps because of the very mechanism we had identified.  This study is not definitive.  It is relatively small, and involves restrictive lab conditions.  But it points to a general take-away about the use of simplified models to study complex social phenomena.</p><p>Without the models we developed to study inequality, we never would have guessed that just being in a small group might be a disadvantage.   There was no a priori reason to test such a hypothesis.  Once modeling work opened up this possibility, though, it gave us reason to experiment.  In general, models can point us to possibilities we might never have imagined without computational resources.  They can tell us what dynamical effects might plausibly occur in the social realm.  Of course, they can’t tell us for sure whether or not these effects are actually at play.  But they can direct us towards empirical work that we otherwise would never  have engage in.  When used carefully, and with the right back and forth with other methods, models are an important part of the social science toolbox, even for topics as complex as unfairness.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a

Dr. Stanway has organised the meeting at the Royal Society of Medicine since 2016, continuously gathering stakeholders and experts in the field and establishing it as an essential meeting in the global oncology agenda. Her passionate engagement across successful global projects on top of her commitments in the clinic, made her the perfect candidate to officially launch the first <a href="http://www.lgcw.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London Global Cancer Week</a> which ran from 25<sup>th</sup>-29<sup>th</sup> November 2019.</p>
<p><u>The promise of universal coverage for global cancer care</u></p>
<p>The choice of invited speakers was excellent with plenary talks and workshops thought-provoking and motivating, although unfortunately, not all talks can be covered here. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/lanonc/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. David Collingride</a> (Editor-in-Chief, <em>Lancet Oncology</em>) has led numerous editorial commissions that focus on cancer control in low and middle income countries (LMICs) over the years. Together with <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024461.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Sarfati</a>, he was an excellent co-chair for the first panel.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How can we prevent the migration of trained cancer surgeons to higher income settings?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>First up on stage, <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/richard-sullivan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Richard Sullivan</a> (Cancer and Global Health, King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust) evaluated how countries have so far committed to delivering <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/universal-health-coverage-(uhc)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universal Health Coverage (UHC)</a> to their respective populations. A promise that is not easy to keep in terms of population covered, interventions covered and financial protection, especially in LMICs. In settings of ongoing armed conflicts, forces of nature or macroeconomic fragility, we often find health is not a top political priority. Corruption and large population migration add further difficulties into the mix. Yet, cancer and its treatment remains the most challenging for any system to address within UHC. How can it be done? Who is in charge when people cross borders to get access to health care in reality? How can the migration of trained cancer surgeons to higher income settings be prevented in the future? Prof. Sullivan raised several fundamental questions that need to be addressed moving forward and that were discussed at length during our coffee break.</p>
<p><u>The global challenges of substandard and falsified medicine</u></p>

<p><a href="https://commonwealthpharmacy.org/who-we-are/staff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chloe Tuck</a> (International Project Lead, Commonwealth Pharmacists Association) and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/ms-oksana-pyzik" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oksana Pyzik</a> (University of London, UCL, School of Pharmacy) shed light on the challenges of availability, acceptability and affordability of cancer treatment in LMICs and introduced their successful work on <a href="http://fightthefakes.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fight the Fakes – Speak up to Falsified Medicine</a>. Whilst having heard previously about fake medical products, I was not aware of the extent of the problem and the resulting damage done worldwide. Most attendees were shocked when the data was presented and we learnt that in some cases old bottles are simply emptied and filled either with the wrong medicine or non-active substances. Leading to bankrupted and dying cancer patients and a massive decrease in trust and confidence in the local health systems and regulations – not just in LMICs but across the Western world as well. Chloe and Oksana pointed us to the latest version of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30426-7/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Oxford statement and Call for Action</a> (<em>Lancet Oncology</em>, Dec 2019) and made it clear; education and raising awareness worldwide are key in fighting the growing threat to human health. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://medswecantrust.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#MedsWeCanTrust campaign</a> launched in 2018 have already connected over 300 partners in more than 45 countries around the globe to discuss, to inform and to consult. Additionally, we will need a robust legal frame work and secure medical product trace technology to validate the drug and its origin.</p>
<p><u>Opportunities provided by digital health in low and middle income countries</u></p>
<p>Digital innovations can be crucial and provide a major opportunity in cancer control across LMICs. <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/atnhs/curator-archive/shafi-ahmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Shafti Ahmed</a> (Consultant surgeon, Barts Health NHS Trust and The Royal London Hospital) gave us a sneak peek into the future of hospitals and introduced us to the first <a href="https://www.medicalrealities.com/osce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual reality (VR) interactive surgical training module</a>s launched by <a href="https://www.medicalrealities.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medical Realities</a> in 2017. This tool allows medical trainers to deliver an immersive learning experience, offering medical students, doctors and surgeons around the world the ability to see interactive VR un-obscured views of operations and to learn directly from specialists. It is further used for live consulting with experts globally while operating on a patient in the theater.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_11637" style="width: 756px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11637 size-full" height="203" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/surgeon_AI.jpg" width="746" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">©Media Reality UK ©Seattle Children’s Hospital</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It was fascinating to watch Prof. Shafti’s video examples. Other tools using artificial intelligence for cervical cancer screening and projects on the usage of low-cost, virtual, augmented and mixed reality to overcome critical gaps in cancer control in LIMCs and beyond are on its way. We will definitely hear more about these in the future.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11625" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11625 size-medium" height="208" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/cancer-care_hands_CR_-photographee.eu_.stockadobe.com_-300x208.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Photographee.eu/istock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>With a bright AI future in mind the talk that followed could not have been more contrasting. <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/carlo-caduff" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Carlo Caduff</a> (Reader in Global Health and Social Medicine, King’s College London) reminded us of fundamental struggles in cancer screening in LMICs and that an understanding of anthropology, local socioeconomic and traditional settings are crucial when it comes to cancer control worldwide. We need to build the evidence base of what people already know and are aware of in order to encourage them or family members to even see doctors, go to hospitals and undergo initial cancer screening. It can be a challenging task that goes beyond the simple survey question of “Do you know the name cancer” where existing religious or traditional beliefs or local dialects can add difficulties into the mix. Identifying those who have influence in a local community is fundamental to progression and utilizing these individuals has been instrumental in overcoming these obstacles in order to successfully run cancer awareness campaigns across rural areas.</p>

<p><u>The vital importance of engaging with decision makers</u></p>
<p><a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024461.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Diana Sarfati</a> (Head of Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Canada) opened the conversations and topic on a political level. We need to identify feasible global cancer control solutions and to identify those in power to act. We need to know what motivates key stakeholders and communicate well in order to drive change and cancer control globally. Her selected best practice examples showed local solutions need to be found for local projects. Prof. Sarfati’s large body of research further revealed ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes, particularly those affecting indigenous people and has identified key patient and health system factors that influence cancer survival. It has been extensively used by health policy makers, clinicians and other researchers to develop policies and practices that have reduced inequities in cancer outcomes. Diana is currently a member of the <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/about-ministry/leadership-ministry/expert-groups/cancer-programme-leadership-board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Cancer Leadership Board</a> in New Zealand, the Advisory Committee to <a href="https://gicr.iarc.fr/hub/pacific-islands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Agency for Research on Cancer’s (IARC) Pacific cancer hub</a>, <a href="https://www.iarc.fr/news-events/reducing-social-inequalities-in-cancer-setting-priorities-for-research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IARC’s international expert group on social inequalities in cancer</a> and the Academic Advisory Committee on the International <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/data-and-statistics/international-cancer-benchmarking-partnership-icbp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cancer Benchmarking Project</a>.</p>
<p><u>Global cancer initiatives and collaborations</u></p>
<blockquote><p><em>  ‘There is no time to lose – we need an urgent call for meaningful action!’ Princess Dina Mired of Jordan</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The meeting was graced by <a href="http://www.uicc.org/sites/main/files/atoms/files/Bio_HRH_Princess_Dina-Mired_October2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HRH Princess Dina Mired of Jordan</a> entering the stage as the president of the <a href="https://www.uicc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union for International Cancer Control</a> (UICC). She is a well-known <a href="http://www.cancercontrol.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HRH-Princess-Dina-Mired-of-Jordan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passionate global advocate</a> for cancer control and non-communicable diseases and a mother of a cancer survivor. It has been fascinating to hear her on the lectern. Her engaging talk on the need for a new paradigm shift on building sustainable partnerships and solutions to tackle cancer control has sent a very strong message and has none of us left in doubt: There is no time to lose – we need an urgent call for meaningful action!</p>
<p>Later in the day, I was given the opportunity to attend a workshop session entitled ‘Africa’. The workshop and discussion forum highlighted examples of successful ongoing collaborations between African institutions and institutions in the UK or the US, including any challenges they are facing.</p>

<p>We heard about cancer program cooperation between the <a href="https://global.unc.edu/global-partners/strategic-partners/malawi-zambia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of North Carolina and the University of Zambia</a> and the collaboration of the <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/global-oncology/uganda.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Uganda Cancer Institute with the Fred Hutchison Cancer Alliance</a> which has resulted in jointly run clinical cancer trials. <a href="http://www.breastcareinternational.org/about-us/the-founder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beatrice Waife</a> presented interesting insights into her Breast cancer control strategy in Ghana; the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jgo.18.95100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breast Care International Approach</a>. Again, major challenges remain here too, e.g. to keep well-trained oncology surgeons who often leave due to lack of infrastructure and schools for their children. Patients are often presenting at late tumor stage (e.g. stage III-VI) and hospitals do not have enough beds and chemotherapy drugs and the majority of care and treatment takes part in homes.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘Patients often present at late tumor stage and the majority of treatment takes part in homes’ </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The whole day was very inspiring and motivating. We explored the important <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31393-9/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">role of primary care in global oncology</a> with <a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1912445255/ophira-m-ginsburg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Ophira Ginsburg</a> (the Director of <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/cancer-geneticist-lead-new-high-risk-cancer-program-nyu-langones-perlmutter-cancer-center" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perlmutter Cancer High Risk Program</a>, University of New York and a <a href="https://www.who.int/ncds/management/ginsburg/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medical Officer for Cancer Control</a> at WHO). We learned first-hand from <a href="http://www.shrikhandeclinic.org/doctors-profile/dr-shailesh-v-shrikhande/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Shailesh V. Shrikhande</a> about his experiences, the challenges and opportunities when setting up cancer centers in India. We were introduced to development of crucial <a href="https://ascopubs.org/go/special/guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resource-stratified oncology guidelines</a> by <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/geography/staff/geogstaffhidden/?id=985" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof Ben Anderson</a> (University of Washington) and learned about a successfully run <a href="https://breastcancertz.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breast Cancer Survivorship programme</a> in Tanzania by <a href="https://www.uicc.org/case-studies/developing-resource-centre-patients-metastatic-breast-cancer-tanzania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Nazima Dharsee</a>, a Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Ocean Road Cancer Institute who also took the <a href="https://www.rsm.ac.uk/prizes-and-awards/prizes-for-trainees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanessa Moss Prize</a> vicarious for the winner <a href="https://trialect.com/members/43?page=4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Nono Ahuka</a>. Overall, global cancer control is an absolutely overwhelming challenge but nevertheless not impossible. Let us stick together to control and fight cancer united and globally!</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/marijuana-2174302_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Marijuana or cannabis is one of the most commonly used drugs among youth in the US.  To date, 33 US states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana use. 11 of these as well as the District of Columbia have legalized the drug for recreational use. The detailed state information can be found <a href="https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/legal-medical-marijuana-states-and-dc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>How do these policies influence marijuana use behaviors among youth?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, many researchers have studied the relationship between marijuana laws and marijuana use behaviors in different populations using individual or ecological level data. Results have been inconsistent. A majority of these studies indicated no effect or protective effect of marijuana laws on youth’s marijuana use behaviors, and several studies reported opposite findings (see the summaries <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0047237918803361" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>After an in-depth review of those published studies either supporting a protective effect or no effect, or indicating a risk effect of the legalization of marijuana use, we identified several crucial limitations of the statistical methods used in previous studies. These can be found in our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8253-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study published today</a> in<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em> BMC Public Health</em></a> as well as our <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0047237918803361" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> published in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/drea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Drug Education</em></a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11609" height="240" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/drugs-300x240.png" width="300" />To address the limitations of the previous studies and figure out the potential relationship between historical events (e.g. drug use policies in general, marijuana policies in particular, and other marijuana-related social movements and events) and marijuana use behaviors among US youth, we analyzed data from <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a> which is a 31-wave nationwide survey. The <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/age-period-cohort-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Age-Period-Cohort modeling analysis</a> was used for data analysis, and can provide more precise and unbiased estimation of the time trend by controlling for the effects from age and birth cohort. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One of our studies</a> published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>JAMA Network Open</em></a> applied the same method to estimate the unbiased time trend of suicide among US youth.</p>
<p>Findings of the adjusted time trend in the current research indicate that when there were national or state policies or movements against marijuana use, such as the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=14&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjoxbPvr6jnAhXB0qQKHUFmA1oQFjANegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dea.gov%2Fcontrolled-substances-act&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pwcONg-tDJVcpCma0kzYV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Controlled Substances Act</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwio3JD-r6jnAhXC26QKHT-ODc8QFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GidgFEJSpg8QbCFigqasX" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anti-Drug Abuse Act</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh9KCLsKjnAhWOC-wKHWUqC4oQFjACegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWar_on_drugs&amp;usg=AOvVaw1apE-cEJOsBJV1nPSI8xrl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">War on Drugs</a> movement, marijuana use among youth would decrease. On the other hand, when there were relatively loose marijuana policies, or movements, such as marijuana decriminalization movements, Medical Marijuana Laws, and Recreational Marijuana Laws, marijuana use among youth would increase accordingly. Additionally, the adjusted time trend was significantly associated with the proportion of the US population covered by Medical Marijuana Laws, especially in the last 15 years.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that more and more US states are legalizing medical and recreational marijuana use, emphasizing the responsible use and developing potential prevention programs targeting youth are essential to protect youth from using marijuana.</p>

<p>An imbalance in power — personal and political — is at the heart of many of the conversations we have around gender. #MeToo sparked a global conversation on the topic, and issues around the gender pay gap and women in leadership roles also deal with matters of unequal power.</p>
<p>But our assumptions about how gender and power interact may start far before we even reach the workplace, new research suggests. In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-019-01116-x">paper published in <em>Sex Roles</em></a>, Rawan Charafeddine from the CNRS in Paris and colleagues conclude that associations between power and masculinity start when we’re barely out of nappies, with children as young as four making the link.</p>
<p><span id="more-39048"></span>We already know that children internalise gendered hierarchies from a young age: <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01433.x">one 2010 study</a>, for example, found that children rate traditionally masculine jobs as more valuable. But researchers hadn’t studied how children assess the relative power of men and women, or what they believe about the way power dynamics affect relationships between genders.</p>
<p>Charafeddine’s team asked 148 French preschoolers to look at an image featuring two non-gendered individuals, one adopting a dominant physical posture and one adopting a submissive or subordinate posture. The children were told that one character was saying “you have to do everything I say!” and one “Ok! I will do what you want!”. They were then asked which character had power and which did not. In the second part of the study, the children were told that one of the figures was actually a man and the other a woman, and asked to identify which was which.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_39051" style="width: 363px;"><img alt="Charafeddine et al" class="  wp-image-39051 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="39051" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Charafeddine et al" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/charafeddine-et-al.png?w=540" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/charafeddine-et-al.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/charafeddine-et-al.png" data-orig-size="540,283" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/03/even-preschoolers-associate-positions-of-power-with-being-a-man/charafeddine-et-al/" height="190" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/charafeddine-et-al.png?w=363&amp;h=190" width="363" />Children saw these figures and were asked to identify the gender of each. <em>Via <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-019-01116-x">Charafeddine et al (2019)</a></em></figure>
<p>Identifying who was the dominant party was not a struggle for the children: 87.4% of participants correctly matched the dominant statement with the upright posture and the subordinate posture with the subordinate statement. And 75% of those children who correctly identified the dominant party were also convinced that the figure was male.</p>
<p>And the findings held across different cultures, too: in a second study, children from Norway, a country with exceptionally high gender equality, were compared to children from Lebanon, where gender equality is lower. And as in the first part of the experiment, 4- to 6-year-old children were more likely to associate the dominant posture with men — though, notably, 3-year-olds were less likely to come to the same conclusion, which the team suggests may be down to a lower awareness of how postures can convey power among younger children.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, 160 schoolchildren were shown the same materials, but this time asked to imagine themselves as one of the two characters (they could choose which). In one condition, participants were told the other character was the same gender as them; in another, the character was of the opposite gender.</p>
<p>Again, a significant number of children were able to identify dominant and subordinate positions (146 of the 160 participants correctly identified which was which). Differences between conditions, however, were interesting. Boys and girls in the “same gender” condition tended to identify with the dominant character. But in the “opposite gender” condition, boys identified more with the dominant character, whilst girls did not tend to identify with one more than the other.</p>
<p>In a final experiment, 213 4- to 5-year-old French and Lebanese children heard a series of exchanges between two hidden puppets, one male and one female, and were asked to guess which puppet occupied the powerful position and which the subordinate. In one scenario, the powerful puppet imposes their will upon the other; in the other, one puppet has more resources than the other.</p>
<p>Again, most of the boys surveyed felt that the powerful puppet in both scenarios was male. But female participants didn’t tend to make this attribution, suggesting that the association between power and masculinity may be weaker in girls.</p>
<p>It is obviously hard to deny a strong societal association between masculinity and power — and an association, as these results suggest, that we learn about from a young age. But this isn’t to say that we’re not making progress, nor that children are not internalising some of the more equality-based messaging that now exists around gender. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/07/16/the-way-children-draw-human-figures-has-changed-since-the-1970s-reflecting-modern-societys-attitudes-to-gender-german-study/">One recent study</a>, for example, looked at how differently children draw figures now compared to 1977: 2015’s participants were far more likely to draw female figures than they were in the 1970s, which the study’s authors took to be related to increased gender equality.</p>
<p>The fact that children under the age of four seemed not to have the same prejudices also suggests that encouraging children to rethink traditional gender roles from an extremely young age may be a helpful way to combat inequalities.</p>
<p>Of course, this is about more than just perception: our beliefs about gender and power affect the way we have relationships with one another, and have a material impact in the workplace. Understanding how our beliefs about power develop may not be enough to combat them entirely, but it could be a useful first step.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/virus-4051654_960_720-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>As of the 3<sup>rd</sup> February 2020 <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17,489 cases</a> have been confirmed in China and 24 other countries, of which, 362 patients have died. This has sparked an overwhelming response by the Chinese government placing more than 60 million people under orders of restricted movement, mandated wearing of masks in public (at the threat of arrest), and increase of their healthcare capacity by, for example, construction of a 1200-bed hospital in just 10 days. The epidemic rages on with an average of 2000 new cases reported daily.</strong></p>
<p>Globally, on the 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020 the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) of the United Nations declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. This defines the outbreak an “extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. Several countries and airlines immediately suspended travel from affected areas, closed some borders with China, and initiated comprehensive preventative screening at airports.</p>
<blockquote><p>on the 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern</p></blockquote>
<p>Early on, the Chinese authorities revealed that the outbreak was caused by a novel beta-coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV. This was soon found to be significantly genetically related to SARS-CoV and other bat coronaviruses. The initial cases were associated with a seafood market in Wuhan where live animals were sold. This suggested a possible animal reservoir for this virus and suggested zoonotic (animal to human) transmission. Later on, environmental samples obtained from this market were found to be positive for 2019-nCoV, strengthening the hypothesis that this is a zoonotic virus. However, whilst the virus was found to have originally started among infected animals, most of the subsequently reported cases were shown to be caused by human-to-human transmission.</p>
<p>Beta-coronaviruses have caused major epidemics in the last 2 decades. In 2003, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SARS-CoV</a> was discovered in China before being spread globally, infecting 8,098 people and killing 774. This was later found to be zoonotic in origin and thought to have started amongst a bat reservoir before later infecting wild civet cats and raccoon dogs that were being sold at live wild animal markets destined for human consumption. In 2012, <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-january-2020-mers-united-arab-emirates/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MERS-CoV</a> was discovered in Saudi Arabia before also spreading globally resulting in 2506 confirmed cases and killing 862 people worldwide. Again, this started as a zoonotic virus, shown to move from camels to humans and again thought to have initially emerged from bats.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11641 aligncenter" height="338" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Capture-300x163.png" width="622" />
<p>Responding to such epidemics requires not only an immense public health and medical response, but also an immense research response. Important scientific questions need to be answered swiftly in order to inform policy makers on where to direct their response capacities and what to expect. Epidemiologically, the transmission rate of the virus needs to be calculated in order to model the number of cases to be expected. The modes of transmission need to be described so that proper prevention actions are taken. The cases need to be characterized so that the most severe and most likely to die patients are taken care of first. Laboratory researchers would need a copy of the virus in order to study its transmission and pathogenicity and work towards finding a vaccine or a cure. Importantly, the animal reservoir through which humans become infected must be identified in order to break the initial transmission cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11642 alignleft" height="167" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/800px-Staff_monitoring_passengers_body_temperature_in_Wuhan_railway_station_during_the_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak-300x167.jpg" width="300" />
<p>When MERS was discovered, a group of witty scientists led by Dutch investigators were able to associate the new virus with camels by showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23933067" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">archived camel sera had antibodies against this new virus</a>. This group deserved to earn the scientific scoop but did the right thing by alerting other coronavirus researchers about their findings even before their paper was published. Taking this hint, my group started sampling camels and verified that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24079378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">camels indeed have antibodies against MERS-CoV in collaboration with researchers from Hong Kong University</a>. Later on, we were able to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24856660" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">isolate MERS-CoV from camels</a>. Determining the animal reservoir allowed the identification of people exposed to camels as an at-risk population and allowed targeted public health prevention campaigns. The animal reservoir for 2019-nCoV is yet to be determined. I hope that researchers are giving this top priority and I hope that they would follow suit of the Dutch scientists by alerting other research groups of potential animal reservoirs at the first available opportunity. It is plausible that the animal reservoir is not only restricted to China and animals in other places may harbor the same virus. Finding the animal reservoir as quickly as possible will improve our chances of breaking the transmission chain.</p>
<p><strong>I call on research funding agencies to give priority to coronavirus research by providing long-term, large-scale funding for emerging coronaviruses that have thus far caused three major epidemics within the last sixteen years alone. A large portion of this funding should be dedicated towards conducting surveillance for coronaviruses in their natural hosts, allowing researchers to understand the ecology of those viruses. In addition, conducting risk-assessment studies to understand which viruses may pose the greatest risk to human health, inevitably aiding the design of future prevention strategies.</strong></p>
<p><b>I also call on researchers and responders to adapt the “<a href="https://www.who.int/features/qa/one-health/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Health</a>” concept in their efforts. Over and over again, emerging zoonotic viruses such as coronaviruses, animal influenza viruses, Ebola, and others prove to be of important global public health concern, highlighting the fact that the health of people, animals, and ecosystems are inherently intertwined. </b></p>

From extensive coverage in the <i><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/sports/aaron-hernandez-brain-cte.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="On the Table, the Brain Appeared Normal">New York Times</a></i> and elsewhere, we already knew that the autopsy revealed extensive <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Research/Traumatic-Brain-Injury/NIH-Chronic-Traumatic-Encephalopathy" target="_blank">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a> (CTE).<br /><br />If you hope to gain insight into repetitive head injury, brain pathology, and violent behavior from watching this documentary, you'll be disappointed. The 3-part series spent 5 minutes on CTE and 3 hours 15 minutes on everything else <span class="st">—</span> his childhood, violent father, hurtful mother, immense athletic talent, football career, ex-con friends, girlfriend and daughter, heavy drug use, street life, weapons collection, paranoia, alleged shootings, alleged same-sex relationships, arrests, murder trials, conviction, appeal, recorded jailhouse telephone conversations, outwardly professed homophobia, death by suicide, and numerous interviews with friends and former players.<br /><br />Much of this material was pruient and unnecessary, especially the speculations about his hidden sexual orientation and how this might have fueled his anger.<br /><br /><br /><b>Prosecution Considered a “Fear of Outing” Motive</b><br /><br />This argument was preposterous and a rarity in the history of violence involving the LGBTQ community: Hernandez supposedly feared that his friend would reveal his secret life as a bisexual man, so he killed Lloyd to preserve his image as a hyper-masculine heterosexual man. This <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/01/24/netflix-aaron-hernandez-killer-inside-cte-sex/" target="_blank">baffling obsession with sexuality is distracting and dangerous</a>, as aptly explained by D. Watkins:<br /><blockquote>There's no evidence proving that Hernandez's sexuality made him a killer. So why is the newly resurfaced Hernandez conversation centered around his sex life? Probably because sex is juicy, forbidden and learning that Hernandez may have been gay provides the consumers with content for endless hours of gossip about what public figures do in their personal lives. </blockquote>Fortunately, this argument was not allowed at trial.<br /><br /><br /><b>The Potential Role of CTE Was an Afterthought</b><br /><br />A <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/aaron-hernandez-football-gay-netflix-939071/" target="_blank"><i>Rolling Stone</i> interview</a> with director Geno McDermott revealed the project began as a 90 minute documentary initially presented at <a href="https://www.docnyc.net/film/my-perfect-world-the-aaron-hernandez-story/" target="_blank" title="MY PERFECT WORLD: THE AARON HERNANDEZ STORY">DOC NYC</a> in 2018. Netflix was interested in expanding the doc into a multi-part series. The gay angle emerged when high school friend/lover Dennis SanSoucie agreed to an on-camera interview. Other additions included newly available recordings of prison phone calls, and a coda about <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Research/Traumatic-Brain-Injury/NIH-Chronic-Traumatic-Encephalopathy" target="_blank">CTE</a>, the neurodegenerative disease that may be associated with repeated concussions in high-impact sports (in concert with other poorly delineated factors).<br /><br />At the very end of <i>Killer Inside</i>, self-serving celebrity defense attorney Jose Baez spoke about the family's decision to donate Aaron's brain to the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cte/" target="_blank">CTE Center</a> at Boston University.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-efTRrUqgl8w/XjeY3Un9_ZI/AAAAAAAANCE/1I8whYi7-DUH_ilgJDJzYubfSVR3-FyIACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/McKee%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Bbrain%2Bof%2BAaron%2BHernandez.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="486" data-original-width="864" height="225" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-efTRrUqgl8w/XjeY3Un9_ZI/AAAAAAAANCE/1I8whYi7-DUH_ilgJDJzYubfSVR3-FyIACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/McKee%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Bbrain%2Bof%2BAaron%2BHernandez.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span>Dr. Ann McKee with the brain of Aaron Fernandez</span></div><br /><br />Dr. McKee said Hernandez had very advanced disease for a 27 year old:<br /><blockquote>...and not only was it advanced microscopically, especially in the frontal lobes which are very important for decision-making, judgment and cognition, this would be the first case we've ever seen of that kind of damage in such a young individual.<br /><br />I can say this is substantial damage that undoubtedly took years to develop. This is not something that is developed acutely or just in the last several years. I imagine these changes had been evolving over maybe even as long as a decade.</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ixw30s3bVpY/Xjec_9V1KUI/AAAAAAAANCQ/LQ55Zh5DdUA6ZHVdJANYvG390pUUUC2MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Aaron%2BHernandez_CTE%252C%2Bstage%2BIII.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="617" data-original-width="864" height="285" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ixw30s3bVpY/Xjec_9V1KUI/AAAAAAAANCQ/LQ55Zh5DdUA6ZHVdJANYvG390pUUUC2MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Aaron%2BHernandez_CTE%252C%2Bstage%2BIII.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Then we see interviews with non-experts, who make causal connections between Aaron's CTE and his erratic, violent, tragic behavior. Worst of all is sleazy lawyer Jose Baez, who <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2017/09/21/read-the-bu-cte-centers-statement-on-aaron-hernandez" target="_blank">drummed up business</a> for other players to sue the NFL under false pretenses (there is currently no way to accurately diagnose CTE in living persons).<br /><br />Why didn't Aaron's brother, who grew up with the same abusive father and played football for many years, become a murderer? I'll let former NFL player Jermaine Wiggins have the last word:<br /><blockquote>My thoughts to people who think that CTE was somehow involved, I think that's an absolute cop out. There are thousands of former NFL players out there that might have dealt with concussions, I've dealt with them. So to use that as a cop out? I'm not... no, no. C'mon, we're smarter than that, people.”</blockquote><br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/is-cte-detectable-in-living-nfl-players.html">Is CTE Detectable in Living NFL Players?</a><br /><span class="st">–</span> this 2013 post is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904765" target="_blank">still true today</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/12/brief-guide-to-cte-brains-in-news-part.html">Brief Guide to the CTE Brains in the News.

                <h4><a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/">The Atlas - Mapping the Histories and Metadata of Digitised Newspapers Collections Around the World</a></h4>

"Between 2017 and 2019, Oceanic Exchanges, funded through the Transatlantic Partnership for Social Sciences and Humanities 2016 Digging into Data Challenge, brought together leading efforts in computational periodicals research from six countries—Finland, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States—to examine patterns of information flow across national and linguistic boundaries. Over the past thirty years, national libraries, universities and commercial publishers around the world have made available hundreds of millions of pages of historical newspapers through mass digitisation and currently release over one million new pages per month worldwide. These have become vital resources not only for academics but for journalists, politicians, schools, and the general public. However, these digitisation programmes share a critical weakness: the very creation of national newspapers collections obscures the fact that international news exchange was central to the nineteenth-century press.

The Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata is an open access guide to digitised newspapers around the world. Its initial selection is limited in scope, being comprised of the ten databases (including the aggregator Europeana) for which we were able to secure access and licensing to the machine-readable data. Nonetheless, it aims to form the foundation of a wider mapping of collections beyond its current North Atlantic and Anglophone-Pacific focus. It brings together their histories and digitisation choices with a deeper look at the language of the digitised newspaper, the evolution of newspaper terminology and the variety of metadata available in these collections. It explores how machine-readable information about an issue, volume, page, and author is stored in the digital file alongside the raw content or text, and provides a controlled vocabulary designed to be used across disciplines, within academia and beyond.

This report draws upon multiple taxonomies: our own open access dataset, which provides a full catalogue of metadata fields across the collections, academic and industry discussions­­ of the newspaper as a journalistic form and historical artefact, digitisation guidelines and strategies, library websites, annual reports, interviews with librarians and digitisation providers and the data files themselves. The maps of this Atlas explore each of our overarching categories in detail, providing a selection of language variants, the technical definition we employed in the categorisation process, and notes on its usage across the collections and in the wider world of press history. This allows a greater understanding of how the term is currently being used in different ways by different groups and allows researchers to navigate to the specific type of information they required and ascertain its availability across these collections. Each entry also includes technical information for obtaining this data across the collections, including data types, which often vary considerably, and XPaths for locating the information within that dataset. With this information, researchers should be able to understand the different structures of these collections and develop computational means for robustly comparing datasets to explore deeper and more meaningful research...."

<p><strong>If you could sacrifice one person to save the lives of five others, would you do it?

People’s answers to the classic trolley problem seem to depend on the “relational mobility” of their society: how easy it is for a person to develop new relationships.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/yMh3lPjmSuk/">Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/OS-blog_Nov-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is both saddening and concerning. The scientific community has come together rapidly to address this outbreak in an open and collaborative manner. As a publisher, we look to support the global response to this outbreak by sharing and amplifying research data and findings relevant to the outbreak. We are re-committing to a joint statement to rapid and open sharing of research data findings, coordinated by Wellcome, available <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/sharing-research-data-and-findings-relevant-novel-coronavirus-ncov-outbreak">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what we are doing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fast-tracking submissions related to the virus or this outbreak across all our seven journals. </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/fee-assistance#loc-fee-assistance-programs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fee waiver assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available as needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strongly encourage all authors submitting coronavirus papers to PLOS journals to also post a preprint, or if appropriate allow us to post to bioRxiv on their behalf at submission. We also strongly encourage all authors with coronavirus papers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">already under review</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at PLOS to post their work as a preprint as soon as possible, if they have not already done so</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strongly encourage all members of the scientific community with expertise in coronavirus or disease outbreaks to volunteer their time to review preprints and papers under review, and to also curate, reuse, repurpose, annotate, and otherwise guide people to resources for tackling this incident. For example, </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview (https://outbreaksci.prereview.org)</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a web application for open, rapid reviews of outbreak-related preprints. The most recent preprints relating to the novel coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv – can be found using this </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We commit to assisting authors in providing their data and findings to the WHO on submission to the journals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be updating our </span><a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disease Forecasting and Surveillance Channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with research related to coronavirus (</span><a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://channels.plos.org/dfs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of course, the research and underlying data we publish in all seven of our journals is open by default from the time of publication, and we encourage and enable preprint posting at every opportunity. Posting a preprint or sharing data ahead of submission never pre-empts publication in PLOS journals. </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Study findings</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our research, which involved interviews with 16 women who were either currently pregnant or had recently given birth to their first child, provides some context around women’s beliefs about physical activity during pregnancy. The research found two key themes<em>: Ownership of body</em> and <em>Unknown territory</em>.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">The findings emphasize the important role of healthcare providers and trainers to provide women with information about physical activity during pregnancy.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme 1:  Ownership of body</span> The participants in the study described feeling a lack of ownership of their own body during pregnancy, which originated from experiencing unfamiliar bodily sensations from common pregnancy symptoms e.g. sickness, tiredness, discomfort:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em> “A little bit kind of unsure of what’s going to happen, and that lack of kind of control over the situation because I, you think you know your asthma, I think I know my asthma, but I don’t know my asthma when being pregnant. I think it means that I don’t necessarily know my body and my health in relation to pregnancy as I did pre-pregnancy so, it’s something that I’ve never experienced before so I don’t know, I don’t know how it’s going to affect my ability to do things.” </em>(Jane)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Women also spoke about how others often offered unsolicited, but good intentioned, advice to try and ‘protect’ the women from coming to harm. This advice, however, inadvertently created a level of pressure to behave in a certain way that limited their physical activity levels:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I was at work and we was really busy and they said oh this patient wants sitting up the bed, quite a large man, and I said oh I’ll come, like because I’m more than happy to but it’s other people I think, I think it’s the guilt of letting me, and if something happens they would blame their self, so I’m like I’ll come, and they were like no no no, and I’m like what is the problem like are you using like the appropriate equipment that I’m supposed to, they’re like no no it’s fine we’ll get somebody else</em>” (Sally)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme 2:  Unknown territory</span> Women experienced a conflict between wanting to be physically active but also wanting to be completely self-assured that their unborn baby was safe. With medical scans few and far between, some women felt a lack of certainty of their baby’s health and saw physical activity as a potential ongoing risk:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“there’s no way to check how it affects your baby, you do know that at the scan the baby’s fine, we cannot tell if what your doing, say if you was to go for a run or go to the gym you don’t know how it affects your baby, because that scan its only so many weeks apart you don’t know the immediate impact of activity on the baby</em>” (Charlotte)</span></p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11615 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/kettlebells-1677217-300x200.jpg" style="color: #000000;" width="300" />
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Women sought advice on what constitutes safe physical activity during pregnancy from a number of places, but the most trusted advice was from medical professionals, such as midwives or doctors, and sports trainers who were professionally trained to work with pregnant women. Some women received vague advice from health professionals and often felt like the advice was not tailored to their situation:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“I’ve read and spoken  to my midwife and GP about it sort of it was all quite, almost quite vague advice saying if your used to exercise then you should carry on but not really specific about the level of activity and how long a period of activity, so I found it quite difficult to sort of make that decision</em>” (Michelle)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Implications for practice</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Women in our study showed an enthusiasm to maintain fitness throughout pregnancy for physical and psychological benefit. The findings from this research emphasize the important role of healthcare providers and sports/physical activity trainers to provide women with the information they need about physical activity during pregnancy. The advice they provide would be best received by the women if individually-tailored and specific to their situation in terms of: (a) how active the woman was pre-pregnancy; and (b) any specific health requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">More support and information about the types of bodily experiences that are normal to feel during pregnancy could help reduce the anxiety that women experience when their bodies feel unfamiliar. This may help them to feel assured that the physical activity they are engaging in is safe for themselves and their baby.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more reasons than ever to submit your work to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE </span></i><b>right now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the journal launches <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/other-article-types#loc-registered-reports">Registered Reports</a>, a new article type that enables authors to preregister and publish their study design protocol before they begin their investigation, followed by a second publication when their research is complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS’ Editorial Director and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Editor-in-Chief </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2020/01/14/registered-reports-are-coming-to-plos-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joerg Heber announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the new article type earlier this month, as a natural fit for the journal’s mission and means of providing greater clarity and transparency in the publication process.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered Reports consist of two stages of publication beginning with the</span> <b>Registered Report Protocol </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which describes the proposed rationale, methodology, and any ethical approvals needed for the work. This initial phase of research is submitted before the authors begin their investigation and is peer-reviewed by the journal to ensure the study’s scientific rigor and fit for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publication criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the authors have had an opportunity to conduct their experiments, gather and analyze the data, and write up their conclusions, they can submit their findings as a </span><b>Registered Report Research Article</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This second stage of publication is reviewed for its adherence to the initial protocol. If accepted, the two articles will be bidirectionally linked on our site to show the full progression of the research.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promises to publish a study if the accepted protocol is followed, so there are no moving goal posts for authors during the review process.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Joerg Heber, Editorial Director and PLOS ONE Editor-in-Chief  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Assessment that reflects the research process</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preregistration has clear </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preregistration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier feedback in the research process helps increase the robustness and reproducibility of a study, set clear expectations for authors from the outset, and guarantees an outcome-neutral assessment of the final research. Since both stages of research are published, they will both be eligible for published peer review history to bring additional context to the research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Registered Reports are already available at a number of journals, particularly in areas involving clinical research, we’re eager to see this practice take a stronger hold in diverse research communities with a desire to increase the transparency of publication. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers breadth of scope that serves more than 200 disciplines and we hope the availability of this article type will make it easier for authors who wish to do so, find incentives for preregistering their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Registered Reports are published in two distinct stages, each stage is subject to an </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/publication-fees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, </span><b>for authors who submit a Registered Report Protocol before July 31, 2020, </b><b><i>PLOS ONE</i></b><b> will waive the fee for publication of the subsequent Research Article</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they have completed their investigation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How to get started</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re about to begin a new study and want to preregister your work, view </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publication criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and submit your manuscript from the journal site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage researchers to deposit their Registered Reports Protocol with the </span><a href="https://cos.io/rr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center of Open Science Registry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>Since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election">exposure of Cambridge Analytica in 2018</a> it is no longer surprising that tech giants are using our information in ways we may not be explicitly aware of. Companies such as Facebook are already <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention">using computer algorithms to identify individuals</a> expressing thoughts of suicide and provide targeted support, such as displaying information about mental health services or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-using-ai-to-try-to-predict-if-youre-suicidal-2018-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">even contacting first responders</a>.</p>
<p>However, the visibility of these features is poor at best — and it remains unclear if the public even wants them in the first place. Now a <a href="https://mental.jmir.org/2019/11/e12942">study</a> in <em>JMIR Mental Health</em> has asked whether the general public would be happy for tech companies to use their social media posts to look for signs of depression. The study found that although the public sees the benefit of using algorithms to identify at-risk individuals, privacy concerns still surround the use of this technology.</p>
<p><span id="more-39028"></span></p>
<p>Dr Elizabeth Ford at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and her colleagues surveyed participants (recruited via mental health charities and many of whom reported depressive symptoms) on their social media use and mental health. They then asked participants about their opinions on a hypothetical situation in which Facebook analysed their social media information to screen for depression, in order to provide targeted mental health care advice or information from charities like the Samaritans.</p>
<p>Out of 183 people who completed the survey, just over a fifth felt that their social media activity would highlight their low moods, and only 3% felt the <em>specific content</em> of these posts would betray how they were feeling.</p>
<p>Participants tended to acknowledge the potential positives of Facebook classifying our mental health, such as widening access to health services. But, overall, they also tended to disagree that the risks to privacy were worth the potential benefits. And although 60% supported the idea of automated algorithms providing healthcare information to users potentially experiencing depression, only 15% were happy for this to occur without their explicit consent.</p>
<p>Participants also had the chance to note down the benefits and risks they saw in Facebook analysing their posts. On the one hand, participants felt that this could improve access to mental health services through targeted advertising. On the other, they voiced concerns that companies tracking social media content in this way could be a risk to online privacy and security (for example, “<em>with the number of data leaks we have by large tech companies, this is a risk too far for many people</em>”). Respondents also thought that such algorithms may not even be particularly accurate and could lead to over-diagnosis. The stigma of being falsely identified as being distressed was a big concern.</p>
<p>Overall, the study showed that the public understood the potential benefits of analysing social media posts to detect and intervene for depression — but believed concerns around individual privacy outweighed these positives. It’s important to note that this study was conducted at the same time as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook">Cambridge Analytica were exposed</a>, and the survey responses may have been influenced by this, as one participant’s quote suggests: “<em>In light of recent revelations about the questionable ethics of Facebook I would find it extremely disturbing if they were using my data</em>”. Still, it’s clear that public trust in tech giants as gatekeepers of our personal data is low, and even campaigns championed by trusted mental health charities have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users">met with considerable backlash</a> when people’s privacy was intruded upon.</p>
<p>Moreover, it could be argued that analysing the public’s data for signs of depression or suicidal ideation is premature. There are concerns about <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/11/facebook-suicide-prevention-tools-ethics-privacy/">the scientific rigour of the data</a> used to support algorithms to predict mental health difficulties. For a start, informed consent is notably absent for “participants” online. Moreover, the unwillingness of tech companies to share their algorithms makes it hard for independent scientists to show that said algorithms are accurately detecting mental health difficulties. Some researchers have also raised questions about whether the content of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">social media posts is actually</a> predictive of emotion.</p>
<p>For now, it seems that privacy is paramount to a public who are eager to post content online but who also, understandably, want to know how this information is being used. Until trust can be re-built by large tech companies such as Facebook, their attempts to intervene in our lives will likely have to be limited to targeted ads for those cat socks <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/28/18158968/facebook-microphone-tapping-recording-instagram-ads">you mentioned once</a> to your friend.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about the paper "Towards Discriminative representation learning for speech Emotion recognition".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In intelligent speech interaction, automatic speech emotion recognition (SER)
plays an important role in understanding user intention. While sentimental
speech has different speaker characteristics but similar acoustic attributes,
one vital challenge in SER is how to learn robust and discriminative
representations for emotion inferring. In this paper, inspired by human
emotion perception, we propose a novel representation learning component (RLC)
for SER system, which is constructed with Multi-head Self-attention and Global
Context-aware Attention Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neutral Network
(GCA-LSTM). With the ability of Multi-head Self-attention mechanism in
modeling the element-wise correlative dependencies, RLC can exploit the
common patterns of sentimental speech features to enhance emotion-salient
information importing in representation learning. By employing GCA-LSTM,
RLC can selectively focus on emotion-salient factors with the consideration
of entire utterance context, and gradually produce discriminative representation
for emotion inferring. Experiments on public emotional benchmark database
IEMOCAP and a tremendous realistic interaction database demonstrate the
outperformance of the proposed SER framework, with 6.6% to 26.7% relative
improvement on unweighted accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p>In an ever-more connected world, it would be easy to assume that loneliness was on its way out — after all, we now have unlimited opportunity to communicate with almost anyone we want at any time we please.</p>
<p>But, in fact, it’s still rife: according to the <a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/the-facts-on-loneliness/">Campaign To End Loneliness</a>, over nine million people in the UK describe themselves as “always or often lonely”. Age has an impact here, too: <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/articles/2018/october/all-the-lonely-people-report/">an Age UK report</a> suggested that the number of over-50s experiencing loneliness will reach two million by 2025 — a 49% increase from 2016.</p>
<p>And with researchers suggesting that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">loneliness can be seen as a disease that changes the brain’s structure and function</a>, this is a significant public health issue, too. You are more likely to have high blood pressure, depression and even face an early death if you’re lonely, so finding strategies with which to combat the experience is vital.</p>
<p><span id="more-39017"></span></p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2019.1699022">research</a> in <em>Aging &amp; Mental Health </em>by Alejandra Morlett Paredes from the University of California, San Diego and colleagues may have some tentative answers. The team interviewed 30 adults aged between 65 and 92, all of whom lived in a senior housing community in San Diego. The community is busy: there are nearly 300 residential units, as well as a tennis court, small golf course and allotment plots. Activities like quilting and sewing sessions, card games, and theatre performances are frequently held for residents.</p>
<p>First, residents were asked to complete a quantitative loneliness assessment. The word “lonely” is not used explicitly in the test; rather, participants were asked to rate how frequently they felt in tune with others around them or how often they felt left out, on a scale of one to four.</p>
<p>They were then interviewed by the team about their experiences of loneliness. Four primary areas were explored: whether participants felt lonely, and how they’d describe those feelings; why they think others feel lonely; how they feel ageing plays a role in loneliness; and what strategies they have for combatting feeling isolated.</p>
<p>Ageing, as you might expect, had a big impact on participants’ feelings of loneliness. The deaths of partners and loved ones was particularly difficult, while participants also commented on how loss of mobility restricted their social activities. Social skills were also identified as a risk factor: one participant noted that those without strong social skills may be more likely to suffer.</p>
<p>Emotionally, loneliness was (unsurprisingly) connected to feelings of emptiness, sadness and lack of meaning. One participant described herself as feeling “lost… and not having control, and sometimes it can lead you to not be able to make decisions and then it just gets worse”, whilst another described loneliness as “the feeling of nothing”.</p>
<p>But many participants also commented on strategies they used to protect against loneliness. Though ageing was a risk factor, <em>acceptance</em> of ageing had more positive outcomes. As one participant put it: “I used to mountain climb… If I can’t walk anymore, I’ll crawl. You have to learn how to be realistic and not brood about it. I know I’m getting older, but I consider life a transition.” Compassion was also useful: being proactive about helping others, for example, helped some participants prevent being lonely.</p>
<p>Spirituality also emerged as a potentially protective trait: for some older people, faith helped them get through the losses of loved ones, and attending religious ceremonies within the community also provided them with strong social connections.</p>
<p>Perhaps most useful on a practical level were participants’ thoughts on environments that facilitate social interaction. Numerous residents mentioned the activities and opportunities for socialising offered by their community — perhaps a good insight into the kind of social structures that need to be developed and embedded within communities to help older people connect with others.</p>
<p>Participants were largely middle or upper-middle class, and the vast majority were white, which means these findings may not bear out across different socioeconomic groups. Those experiencing poverty or racism, or who don’t live in similar assisted living communities, are unlikely to have the same experiences</p>
<p>But working on both structural changes and learning about protective psychological factors may be a crucial weapon in the fight against loneliness.</p>

<p><strong>Do we worry too much about screen time? </strong>The iss<span>u</span><span>e of screen use by children and teenagers is rarely out of the headlines, and institutions including the World Health Organization have recommended specific limits on screen time for the youngest age groups. B</span><span>ut what does the science actually say about the effects of screen time? </span></p>
<p><span>To find out, our presenter Ella Rhodes talks to </span><a href="https://www.amyorben.com/">Dr Amy Orben</a><span>, Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge and </span><a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/february-2020/amy-orben-honoured">winner of the 2019 BPS award for Outstanding Doctoral Research, </a><span>who has explored the psychological effects of screen time in her research. </span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">From our earliest moments, our awareness of being physically close to someone else is tied up with perceptions of actual warmth. It’s been suggested that this relationship becomes deeply ingrained, with temperature in turn affecting our social perceptions on into adulthood. However, some of the <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/"><span style="color: black;">most-publicised results in this field have failed to replicate</span></a></span><span class="None">, leading critics to query whether the relationship really exists.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Now a </span></span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-79280-001"><span style="color: black;">new paper</span></a></span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">, published in <i>Social Psychology</i>, provides an apparently compelling explanation for at least some inconsistencies in the results, and supports the idea that our temperature does indeed affect our social judgements.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38987"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">An earlier study found, for example, that lonelier people take warmer, more frequent baths, presumably to alleviate their loneliness. But the results of replications of this work were mixed — some supported the original findings, while others didn’t. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Adam Fay at the State University of New York and Jon Maner at Florida State University realised that neither the original temperature/social feelings studies, nor the replications, considered the <i>ambient</i> temperature when the research was done. In theory, though, this might affect the results.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">So Fay and Maner ran their experiment on days that ranged from 8°C all the way to 28°C, and noted this temperature each time. A pair of research assistants standing in busy areas of a university campus recruited a total of 78 participants for the study, which was ostensibly to test attitudes to a heated back wrap. After the battery-powered wrap was strapped around a participant’s waist, they were asked about the pleasantness of the product, but then also how likely they were, over the next week, to engage in various social behaviours, such as catching up with an old friend or making a phone call to someone they cared about. For some of the participants, the strap wasn’t turned on. For others, it was, and it produced a mild heat.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Asking people how likely they think they are to do something in the future isn’t a great way to explore actual future behaviour. But that wasn’t the point of this study. The researchers just wanted to know whether there was an interplay between the ambient temperature and the heat or absence of heat from the back wrap on the participants’ answers — and there was. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">When the back wrap was not switched on, people reported a greater intention to socialise over the next week when questioned on colder days, compared with warmer days. This could be seen as consistent with the idea that feeling cold physically is also perceived as feeling “colder” socially, driving a desire for more contact with other people. When the back wrap was switched on, however, this effect was eliminated, further supporting the link.</span></span></p>
<p>The new findings “suggest that seemingly subtle changes in temperature can have important implications for the psychology of social affiliation, and such findings apply in real-world contexts outside the laboratory,” the researchers write.</p>

Indeed, after the age of 80, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.13955" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 30% of individuals present three or more limitations</a>. Unfortunately, many health professionals working with older patients are not sufficiently aware of the impact of these difficulties on daily living. As a result, they may adopt inappropriate attitudes towards older persons they care for, such as lack of patience or empathy.</p>
<p>The aging-simulation experience is a promising method to make health professionals feel the age-related limitations and to promote empathy towards older persons. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1409-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our new study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, describes the effects of this innovative educational training.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<p>During the academic year 2015-2016, we gathered 306 health professionals working with older patients in the Department of Gerontology and Geriatrics at Sorbonne Université in France to actively participate in the aging-simulation experience.</p>
<p>The age-simulation suit we used, GERT (Wolfgang Moll, Germany), is composed of several elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>overshoes reducing the perception of the ground</li>
<li>cervical collar simulating stiffness of the neck</li>
<li>knee and elbow pads limiting movement</li>
<li>weights on wrists and ankles reproducing muscle loss</li>
<li>a ballasted plastron (weighted breastplate) causing an arched posture</li>
<li>a headset and glasses simulating loss of hearing and vision</li>
<li>gloves simulating loss of sensitivity

</ul>
<p>Each participant wore the aging suit for an average of 15 minutes and performed different actions according to a defined scenario: sitting and getting up from a chair, going up and down stairs, lying down on the floor and getting up, serving a glass of water and drinking it, and eating.</p>
<p>We collected participants’ perceptions of age-related limitations before and after the simulation experience using a self-administered questionnaire comprising free association tests and Likert scale questions. We created semantic categories from participants’ free evocations and we compared participants’ answers before and after the simulation experience. In total, we collected 3,060 free evocations and ten semantic categories emerged: (1) decreased hearing, (2) decreased vision, (3) stiffness, (4) slowness, (5) loss of balance, (6) fall, (7) clumsiness, (8) negative emotions, (9) loneliness, and (10) difficulties. These semantic categories focused on two aspects, the first concerning participants’ geriatric knowledge about age-related functional and sensory limitations and the second concerning participants’ feelings related to the aging-simulation experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Effects of the aging-simulation experience</strong></h3>
<p>We observed statistically significant changes in the categories quoted by participants before and after the simulation experience. First, some categories were less cited after the simulation experience, such as the categories <em>decreased hearing</em> (from 88% to 79%) and <em>slowness</em> (from 76% to 62%). Second, some categories were more often mentioned after the experience, such as <em>stiffness</em> (from 11% to 17%), <em>loneliness</em> (from 11% to 25%), and <em>difficulties</em> (from 42% to 60%) . Lastly, we noted that participants’ opinions on age-related difficulties were impacted by the experience:  participants considered age-related difficulties to be more significant after the aging-simulation experience than before.</p>
<blockquote><p>The emotions elicited during this experience anchor perceptions of functional and sensory limitations deeply in the memory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, it is clear that the aging-simulation experience modifies health professionals’ perceptions of functional and sensory limitations. Moreover, this educational device improves patience and empathy of health professionals towards older patients, which has been documented by a complementary qualitative study (in press) based on semi-structured interviews.</p>
<h3><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3>
<p>During this experience, health professionals feel the effects of aging and put themselves in the shoes of older patients they care for. Thus, professionals become aware of the impact of age-related limitations on activities of daily living. The emotions elicited during this experience anchor perceptions of functional and sensory limitations deeply in the memory. Conducted in groups, the workshops on the simulation allow health professionals to share a convivial moment and to build together more accurate representations of older individuals.</p>
<p>This device is simple to implement. At the beginning of the workshop, a short presentation by the teacher introduces participants to the experience. Then the participants can operate independently, helping each other to dress and undress. A short intervention (about 15 minutes in the simulation suit for each participant) is sufficient to change mindsets. However, it is important that, at the end of the workshop, the teacher offers a debriefing time for participants to share their feelings resulting from this sensory experience.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>
<p>Few studies have examined the effects of this pedagogical training on the medium and long term. It would be interesting, in the future, to explore the persistence of this experience over time, as well as its effects on care practices.</p>

<p>How environmentally friendly am I really? It’s a question we ask ourselves more and more frequently as the climate emergency remains firmly at the top of the political agenda. So we dutifully eschew single-use purchases, lug our tote bags to the supermarket instead of using plastic bags, and take part in Veganuary, safe in the knowledge we’re doing our bit.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, we may be overestimating how well we’re actually doing at being green. According to new research published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2019.1689364"><em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em></a>, most of us tend to magnify our own environmental efforts, believing we’re doing more than others even when that isn’t the case. The finding is the latest in a number of studies to demonstrate the “better-than-average” effect: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">we also believe</a> we are more intelligent than others, for example, and that we work harder.</p>
<p><span id="more-38965"></span></p>
<p>To examine self-image and environmentalism, author Magnus Bergquist from the University of Gothenburg first asked 2,635 Swedes one question: compared to other Swedes, how often/how much do you engage in pro-environmental behaviours? Participants responded via a 7 point scale, running from 1 (much less than others) to 7 (much more than others).</p>
<p>In a second study, 513 participants located in the UK, India and the United States were asked the same question, rating themselves compared to their own compatriots and their friends. In addition, Indian participants were given an open-ended question about the kinds of pro-environmental behaviour they performed, whilst those in the UK and US were asked how frequently they engaged in 10 predefined behaviours (turning the tap off whilst brushing teeth, for example, or turning lights off when leaving a room).</p>
<p>Both studies suggested that most people perceive themselves to be more pro-environmental than others. In the first study, 51.3% of Swedish participants felt they were more green than others; only 8.6% felt they were below average. The second bore similar results: 75.3% of the total sample felt they were above average (85.7% in India, 72% in the UK, and 63.7% in the US).</p>
<p>Participants also felt that they were better than average when it came to most of the individual behaviours in the survey — but these results might not hold across <em>all</em> pro-environmental behaviours. Most of those listed in survey questions were easy — putting something in the recycling bin, for example, or turning off lights. More difficult pro-environmental behaviour — perhaps making a more fundamental life change like completely overhauling a diet — may not provoke such high self-opinion. Bergquist points to research that suggests people think of themselves as <em>worse</em> than average when tasks appear difficult: one study showed 70% of people felt they could win a trivia contest with easy questions, whilst only 6% felt they could win when things were more tricky.</p>
<p>There was some good news, though. In a final study, Bergquist didn’t find much evidence that believing you are better-than-average prevents you from engaging in pro-environmental behaviours — so the effect may be more psychological than it is practical.</p>
<p>Finding out how we feel about more profound behavioural change could be interesting, as could a more comprehensive study into the impact of under- and overestimation of ability on the way we act — and may also prove to be a good avenue through which to stimulate positive, pro-environmental behaviour.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-6-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>More than a third of women worldwide – within every culture, race, ethnicity, and throughout every socioeconomic class – have <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experienced some form of sexual or physical violence</a> or abuse from partners or ex-partners These incidents, referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), severely affect not only the women themselves but also the children and infants within their families.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0867-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Women’s Health</em></a>, our team examined the prevalence of IPV among women and its association with rates of mortality among neonates, infants, and children less than five years of age. We focused on the East African countries of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, where there are high rates of both IPV and neonatal, infant, and child mortality.</p>
<h3><strong>The Association of Violence with Maternal and Child Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p>We found that children were more at risk of dying as newborns, infants and children prior to the age of five if their mothers ever experienced IPV. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260513507140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Violence</a> affects the social, mental, and psychological well-being of mothers, undermines their capacity to care for their child, and contributes to underutilization of maternal health services. Given the role that a mother plays in a child’s life, her health status during and after pregnancy is a direct predictor of an infant and child’s health outcomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Protective Factors</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11599 alignright" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/feature-pic-259x300.jpg" width="259" />While IPV was significantly associated with death among neonates, infants, and children, other factors such as antenatal care, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sexual autonomy,</a> giving birth in hospitals, and receiving professional assistance during birth were protective. Consequently, access to adequate maternal health services can help mitigate the association between IPV and infant and child mortality rates.</p>
<h3><strong>Combating IPV</strong></h3>
<p>Our team continues to explore the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518804177?journalCode=jiva" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moderating effects</a> of violence on maternal and child outcomes. WHO has provided guidance on the role of the health system in managing and combating IPV. Health care providers’ responses to those who have been victims of intimate partner violence must be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302966/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multifaceted</a>, with identifying those at risk as only the first step in proper response. As providers screen patients, victims of IPV can explore their options regarding plans for safety and access to support services.</p>
<p>In our study, experiencing IPV was significantly associated with individual and socio-economic factors including area of residence, wealth index, age of mother and her husband, religion, level of education, employment status, and mass media usage. Interventions should thus strive to focus on addressing IPV at a macro level through policy enhancement and not just individual levels. The interconnectedness of the individual and socio-ecological influences warrants an in-depth assessment of this association.</p>

<p>We tend to think of sleep as a positive thing. Not enough of it, and we suffer: our moods drop, and we find it harder to both concentrate on what’s in front of us and remember what’s happened. Being well-rested, on the other hand, is associated with greater ability to communicate, to achievement at home and at work, and to superior <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">recollection of previously learned facts or events</a>.</p>
<p>Based on what we already know about the benefits of sleep on memory it may seem obvious that going to bed would also help eyewitnesses identify those they had seen perpetrate crimes. But in a new study, published in <em><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170501">Royal Society Open Science</a></em>, researchers found no such association: it was confidence, not being well-rested, that made a difference.<span id="more-38960"></span></p>
<p>The team, led by David Morgan from the University of Heidelberg, asked 2,000 participants to watch a 35-second-long video clip of a man stealing a laptop from an empty office; his face was visible throughout the clip. After a distractor task, in which they were asked to unjumble anagrams of US states, half of the participants were asked to wait twelve hours before picking the perpetrator from a line-up.The other half also completed the identification twelve hours later — but only after they had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>Findings from previous literature suggested that this second group might perform better. But, in fact, sleep did <em>not </em>improve memory: participants who had gone to sleep before identifying guilty suspects were just as likely to accurately identify the correct suspect as those who had not. Instead, it was identifications made with “high confidence” that were the most accurate, regardless of whether or not participants had slept.</p>
<p>The two groups were also no more or less reliable at identifying suspects than a control group, which only had a five minute interval between witnessing the crime and taking the test: in each condition, participants’ confidence in their identification predicted their success.</p>
<p>The paper’s authors suggest that care should be taken by police to understand how confident eyewitnesses are when they identify perpetrators.</p>
<p>“Our research suggests police should collect expressions of confidence in the initial identification because these are predictive of accuracy regardless if there was a delay between witnessing the event or not or if sleep took place,” <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/december/eyewitness-identification.html">said</a> senior author Professor Laura Mickes.</p>
<p>“Additionally, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should make use of this information in legal proceedings.”</p>
<p>More research needs to be done here: most literature suggests that sleep <em>does</em> consolidate memory and improve recollection, so working out what prevents it from having a positive effect on eyewitness memory may be worthwhile. Further understanding the role of confidence could also be fruitful — and could even, as the researchers suggest, change the way we deal with crime.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617020034/0/oupblogpsychology/">Does Consciousness Have a Function?</a></h4>

<p>Perhaps, the most fascinating question about consciousness is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">the Hard Problem</a>. It’s the problem of explaining why and how subjective experiences arise from complex electrochemical interactions happening in the brain. It is Hard because the working of the brain should be fully described in term of physical interactions, leaving no room for subjective experiences to fit within our current views of the physical world.</p><p>This theoretical position is so powerful that scientists often cannot escape from the view that consciousness is an epiphenomenon that plays no role, but just appears as a by-product of information processing in the brain. Even if consciousness researchers may not explicitly admit that they take this position, it is a position difficult to argue against.</p><p>The Hard problem is contrasted with Easy Problems, which are about explaining neural mechanisms of objective and observable aspects of consciousness such as the report of conscious perception or voluntary action. Easy Problems are the kind of problems that neuroscientists are usually working on.</p><p>The problem of Easy Problems is that they are not easy at all. To work on<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Hard_problems_and_easy_problems"> Easy Problems</a>, we first need to know what kind of functions are associated with consciousness. Many authors have discussed cognitive functions that may require consciousness. The list includes non-reflexive behaviour, intention, imagination, planning, thought, short-term memory, attention, metacognition, emotion and so on. However, there is nothing decisive about such a list at this moment. In fact, empirical studies have revealed quite a range of cognitive functions can be performed outside of conscious awareness even when the stimuli relevant for the task are not perceived consciously. Even functions thought to be tightly linked with consciousness such as attention, working memory, and executive control can be performed in the absence of conscious awareness. Such empirical findings further corroborated the belief aligned with the theoretical cul-de-sac of the Hard problem.</p><p>Nevertheless, we should still keep searching for biological functions of consciousness. Easy Problems may not be as sexy as the Hard Problem (because the name suggests they are easy), but the importance of solving Easy Problems should not be undermined. Specifically, we need to understand what is enabled or caused by items that enter consciousness as oppose to those that remained unconscious. This fundamental problem about consciousness is termed the Hard Question by Daniel Dennett, and relatively little attention has been devoted to directly answer this question. Without solving the Hard Question, we are not even ready to attack Easy Problems.</p><p>To appreciate the Hard Question, we should distinguish consciousness as a biological phenomenon and conscious experience. When we consider functions of consciousness, they are the functions that are enabled by stimuli that enter consciousness or the functions that can be performed only in awake humans or animals. Functions in this sense should not be confused with the question of what kind of effects conscious experiences (or qualia) exert on physical systems. Because of the conflation of these two different meanings of functions of consciousness, sometimes the validity of asking the Hard Question seems to be questioned. But once this distinction is clear, we are ready to tackle the Hard Question as a target of empirical research.</p><p>In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2019/1/niz016/5648002">our recent article</a> published in Neuroscience of Consciousness, we aimed to offer our tentative answer to the Hard Question by hypothesising possible functions of consciousness. While many cognitive functions are known to occur without consciousness, several lines of empirical evidence in neuroscience and psychology revealed tasks and conditions in which consciousness appears to be necessitated (e.g. trace conditioning). In the paper, we started off by reviewing existing ideas about functions of consciousness and then aimed to propose a unified account for the diverse consciousness demanding tasks in terms of a common underlying function.</p><p>The gist of our hypothesis (called the Information Generation Hypothesis) is as follows: the function of consciousness is to generate possibly counterfactual representations of an event or a situation using generative models of the environment and the self, which are learned through interactions with the environment. The term counterfactual here is used to refer to situations or events that are not happening in front of the agent at the present moment. Such representations allow the agent to interact with the information stored from the past (i.e. short-term memory) or to plan ahead through mental simulation of possible future (i.e. imagination or planning). Importantly, this formulation of functions of consciousness explains in a coherent manner a range of non-reflexive cognitive phenomena such as intention, imagination, planning, short-term memory, attention, curiosity and creativity. Another important implication of this hypothesis is that it is a departure from the traditional view that the brain is a passive information processing machine. Instead, the hypothesis suggests that contents of consciousness are the results of active reconstruction of the reality.</p><p>Finally, our depiction of the role of consciousness opens up a new avenue for understanding the relationship between consciousness and (general) intelligence. A functional advantage implemented by the information generation architecture enables an agent to perform mental simulations for planning future action sequences for novel goals. This function of consciousness endows the agent with the ability to achieve novel goals that are difficult to attain only with a collection of reflexes. This flexible application of knowledge (i.e. generative/forward models) is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour and hint at the origins of consciousness in the course of evolution.</p><p>Feature Image credit: Geralt via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/nerves-network-nervous-system-line-2728138/">Pixabay</a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/does-consciousness-have-a-function/">Does Consciousness Have a Function?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/617020034/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/617020034/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/617020034/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/" rel="nofollow">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/using-math-to-understand-inequity/" rel="nofollow">Using math to understand inequity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/12/how-address-enigmas-everyday-life/" rel="nofollow">How to address the enigmas of everyday life</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Being able to get away with a few white lies can be a useful skill. Giving your boss a plausible explanation as to why you’re late to work, for example, can be fairly handy — why do they have to know you just pressed snooze a few too many times?</p>
<p>Some of us get better results than others, of course, when we tell fibs. But those who <em>think</em> they’re better at lying than average seem to have a few things in common, according to new research <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225566">published in <em>PLOS One</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-38946"></span></p>
<p>To understand what makes a good liar, Brianna Verigin from Maastricht University and colleagues surveyed 194 participants on their lying habits.</p>
<p>First, participants were asked to rate how good they were at deceiving others on a scale of one to ten. They then estimated how many lies they had told in the last 24 hours, and responded to multiple-choice questions about the kinds of lies they had told (e.g. white lies, exaggerations or fabrications), who they had lied to and how they had lied (e.g. face to face, over the phone or by text message).</p>
<p>In the second part of the study, participants were asked to share the strategies they use when telling lies, and rate how important they felt verbal and non-verbal (i.e. by using body language) strategies were for getting away with fibs. Finally, they were shown a list of strategies, such as providing details someone cannot check or ensuring stories are plausible, and asked to select which they use.</p>
<p>And though previous research has suggested that most people tell one to two lies per day, the results here paint a different picture: that a small number of “prolific liars” are responsible for most of this figure. In fact, 39% of participants reported telling no lies at all, and just six participants were responsible for a whopping 40% of all lies.</p>
<p>The results also showed that those who told more lies felt they were better at deception; high self-reported fibbing ability was also linked to a greater likelihood of telling lies to colleagues and friends, though not to family or authority figures. Those who see themselves as good liars were also more likely than poor liars to do it face to face, and white lies were the most frequent form of deception, followed by exaggerations, hiding information, burying lies and simply making things up.</p>
<p>As for strategy, several techniques were frequently used. “Keeping the statement clear and simple” was popular with 17.6% of participants, with “telling a plausible story” (15.1%) and “being vague about details” (13.2%) coming next. Good liars were more likely to use a range of strategies, whilst poor liars were far more likely to use avoidance.</p>
<p>“Prolific liars rely … a great deal on being good with words, weaving their lies into truths, so it becomes hard for others to distinguish the difference, and they’re also better than most at hiding lies within apparently simple, clear stories which are harder for others to doubt,” <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191220105633.htm">said Verigin</a></p>
<p>And demographics appear to have a big impact, too. Of those who classified themselves as “poor liars”, 70% were female compared to 30% men; conversely, 62.7% of those who believed they were “good liars” were men compared to 27.3% female.</p>
<p>As with any findings based on self-reporting, these results may need to be taken with a pinch of salt. But this initial understanding of how proficient liars weave their web of falsehoods could be an interesting path to pursue, not least in developing strategies to work out when someone is lying.</p>
<p>The fact liars combine lies with the truth is particularly interesting — though we may feel like we can tell when someone is lying because of the <em>content</em> of what they say, this may actually be a bit more difficult. Developing new ways to detect lies, therefore, may be useful (particularly when it comes to criminal investigations).</p>
<p>But until then, don’t worry — your boss probably believes your train really was delayed.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/">Une analyse globale de la nouvelle politique de recherche - (II) Préjugés psychologiques de l’idéologie managériale</a></h4>

<p>J’ai souligné dans la <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">première partie</a> que l’idéologie managériale qui sous-tend les réformes actuelles de la recherche et de l’enseignement supérieur, et plus globalement la théorie du <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_gestion_publique"><em>nouveau management public</em></a>, est un obscurantisme. D’un point de vue scientifique, ce qui est frappant dans l’idéologie managériale, c’est la grossièreté des présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Il ne s’agit que de carotte et de bâton : primes d’un côté, précarisation de l’autre. « Manager », c’est donc concevoir une structure d’incitations appropriées (« incentive structure »). La seule façon de faire travailler quelqu’un est de l’inciter financièrement à le faire, et de le sanctionner lorsqu’il ne le fait pas bien. En résumé, c’est de la psychologie béhavioriste dans sa version la plus grossière.</p>
<p>Il n’est apparemment pas venu à l’idée de ces gens qu’on puisse faire un travail parce qu’on l’aime, sans qu’il y ait pour autant une récompense extrinsèque, ou la menace d’une sanction. Ou qu’on puisse soigner correctement un patient, ou éviter de trafiquer ses données scientifiques, pour des raisons avant tout morales - comme le respect de son prochain et l’éthique intellectuelle. Ce n’est peut-être pas un hasard si ces idées sont théorisées principalement par des économistes, dont un certain nombre (heureusement, pas tous) semblent croire à la fable ridicule de l’« <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-criticism-of-homo-economicus-or-people-are-neither-rational-nor-irrational/">homo economicus</a> ».</p>
<p>Or il se trouve (quelle surprise) que l’avidité et la peur ne sont pas les seules passions humaines. Il y a une littérature considérable en psychologie, par exemple, sur la motivation intrinsèque, comme la curiosité. Voir par exemple la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychologie)">théorie du flow</a> de Mihály Csíkszentmihályi - mais pourquoi donc des gens font-ils du surf sans être payés ?! Et oui, les comportements moraux et altruistes existent, chez l’humain comme chez bien d’autres espèces (voir par exemple le travail de l’éthologue <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal">Frans de Waal</a>). Il y a également une dimension morale dans une grande partie des activités sociales, et de manière évidente dans les métiers scientifiques et de santé : il s’agit de rechercher la vérité, ou de soigner des personnes (il ne peut pas y avoir de débat scientifique sans un minimum de confiance attribuée à ses acteurs). Ce que résume l’expression « conscience professionnelle ».</p>
<p>La motivation humaine est complexe, et si elle ne se réduit pas à l’altruisme, elle ne se réduit pas non plus à l’avidité et la peur. On se demande bien d’ailleurs quel degré d’inculture il faut avoir en face de nous pour que ce rappel soit nécessaire, tant une bonne partie de la littérature tourne autour de ce fait.</p>
<p>Le rôle des structures, par conséquent, est de permettre à certains aspects de la motivation humaine de s’exprimer, plutôt que d’autres. Ceci est très bien illustré par le <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vzxdYm8NzY">discours poignant d’une diabétologue</a> dans le contexte des politiques managériales de l’hôpital. Elle y explique l’effet d’une gestion bureaucratique fondée exclusivement sur la carotte et le bâton : « je devenais une espèce de robot », « je ne suis plus éthique ». Cette nouvelle organisation fondée exclusivement sur la récompense et la sanction (extrinsèques) la conduit à ne plus exercer correctement son métier. Or, le point crucial à relever, c’est qu’auparavant, les médecins n’avaient absolument pas besoin de cela pour soigner les patients. Ils soignaient parce que c’était leur métier. Pas parce que ça rapporte à l’hôpital et que du coup ils auront peut-être une prime. Il existe (existait) des structures sociales pour encourager cette attitude vertueuse. Par exemple la formation (comme l’internat) dans des structures où cette attitude est socialement valorisée. Peut-être aussi la sélection : pour être médecin hospitalier, il faut avoir fait ses preuves dans un service hospitalier, et donc être choisi par d’autres médecins hospitaliers selon des critères propres à l’éthique du métier, et non selon le taux de remplissage des lits.</p>
<p>Quelle drôle d’idée, lorsque l’on a un système qui fonctionne en permettant aux motivations humaines les plus vertueuses de s’exprimer, de le changer pour un système manifestement dysfonctionnel, précisément parce qu’il est organisé pour encourager le pire de l’humain - l’avidité et la peur. Cette drôle d’idée, on ne peut l’avoir que si l’on possède une vision caricaturale de la psychologie humaine. Une vision sectaire et, puisqu’en l’occurrence il s’agit de choses très documentées scientifiquement, une vision obscurantiste. Dans ce contexte, l’insistance des partisans du nouveau management public à instaurer une révolution culturelle (la fameuse « culture du résultat ») est particulièrement inquiétante. Il s’agit ni plus ni moins que d’expurger pratiquement tout ce qu’il y a d’humain en chacun de nous, et de nous transformer, en effet, en « une espèce de robot ».</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Watching climate activist Greta Thunberg’s passionate speech to world leaders at the UN in New York last September, it was impossible not to be struck by her depth of feeling. For me, it was deeply moving. For a guest speaking on <em>Fox News</em>, this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzaQz5yYJHs">“climate hysteria” from a “mentally ill Swedish child”</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hardly news to point out that Thunberg is polarising. For everyone who feels shocked and shamed into doing whatever they can — no matter how small — to mitigate climate change, there seems to be someone else who finds her outrage unbearable. But would Thunberg really be more broadly appealing if she did things any differently? Are there, in other words, any lessons from psychological research that she and other activists might bear in mind?</p>
<p><span id="more-38939"></span></p>
<p>For any activist hoping to change the world, their audience must first accept that change is necessary, and also feel motivated and empowered to achieve that change. Psychology is of course key to all this, and <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/september-2018/yawning-apocalypse">numerous studies are being done in this area</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to that first point — accepting the need for change — Nadia Bashir at the University of Toronto and colleagues wondered whether people might resist it in some cases not because (or not just because) they have problems with the message, but rather because they’re not keen on the messenger.</p>
<p>In an online study involving 140 US participants, published in 2013, the researchers found that environmentalist activists were perceived as being unappealingly eccentric and militant. Not only did the participants perceive them as having unappealing traits, but <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/02/activists-have-an-image-problem-say-social-psychologists/">they didn’t want to affiliate with such people, either</a>. Their “seemingly zealous dedication to a social cause may backfire and elicit unfavourable reactions from others,” Bashir and her colleagues wrote. “The very individuals who are most actively engaged in promoting social change may inadvertently alienate members of the public and reduce pro-change motivation.”</p>
<p>Given these results, you might suspect that this particular participant group had more “anti-environment” than “pro-environment” members. However, as research out of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication has made plain, <a href="http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/Global%20Warming/12-2015%20Segmentation%20Report_D10_DTP%20Formatted_v2b-1b.pdf">the division within the general public is simply not that binary [PDF]</a>. The researchers identified nine distinct “environmental attitude” groups in the US, each with their own constellation of views on everything from whether an environmental crisis exists to what the government’s role should be in regulating it. Parts of Thunberg’s UN speech may, then, have struck the receptive minds of some across the pro- and ‘anti’-environment lines, while causing others to batten down their psychological hatches. Of course, you can’t please all of the people all of the time. If it were possible to direct nuanced climate change-related messages to these distinct groups, potentially, this might lead to more desired change overall.</p>
<p>What about emotion? Should activists display it, or not? The great Roman orator and statesman Cicero <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/192160?seq=1">advised speakers to prefer emotion to reason</a>. And <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/seminarinemotion/2018/03/05/targeting-specific-audiences-using-emotional-appeals/">emotion-based marketing</a> is known to be more effective than fact-based approaches. Some people do find all-out outrage off-putting. But perhaps our society needs to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/09/psychologists-claim-outrage-is-getting-a-bad-rap/">encourage a more positive view of it</a>, argue a trio of psychologists from Penn State and Harvard. In one experiment, published in 2018, they reported that feelings of outrage were more effective at driving participation in a project to address an injustice than feelings of hope that such a project might work. Moral outrage is a “critical force for collective action,” they concluded.</p>
<p>Teenagers are renowned for doing outrage pretty well. They’re also well-connected via social media, and also have other activist advantages, argued Albert Bandura at Stanford University and Lynne Cherry of the organisation Young Voices for the Planet, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2019-49287-001">in a 2019 paper</a> in <em>American Psychologist</em>. “Climate scientists have been sounding increasingly urgent alarms about the catastrophic consequences of climate change,” the pair wrote. And yet, “twenty annual UN Summits provided no international commitment to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases”. So it’s important to look at who might be best placed to really make a difference — and they believe the answer lies in young activists.</p>
<p>Young people are in a better position to catalyse action on climate change than most adults, think Bandura and Cherry. Young people are effective messengers, they write, because without change, they will suffer far more than the adults around today. And they can occupy the moral high ground, because the audience knows that they are not beholden to special interests (like making money or winning elections).</p>
<p>Thunberg has achieved truly global fame, but Bandura and Cherry point to other examples of hugely influential young activists, such as German environmentalist Felix Finkbeiner, who, after learning as a boy that trees absorb carbon dioxide, <a href="https://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/home">set up a project</a> that has led to more than a million trees being planted worldwide. Think back to the second part of what’s needed for change (feeling motivated and empowered to achieve that change) — Finkbeiner presented a problem, and also a practical way for people to help, even in the smallest way, to address it. There are many other examples of child <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/28/generation-greta-young-climate-activists-around-world">environmental activists</a> bringing about meaningful change, they note.</p>
<p>There is evidence that even in the US, record numbers of people are worried about climate change. According to the results of <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/">a nationally representative survey, published in 2019</a>, 73 per cent think it’s happening, 69 per cent are worried about it and 29 per cent are very worried. “After a year of devastating extreme events, dire scientific reports, and growing media coverage of climate change, a record number of Americans are convinced that human-caused global warming is happening, are increasingly worried, and say the issue is personally important to them,” said lead researcher Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale University.</p>
<p>Climate activists like Thunberg may, then, increasingly be preaching to the converted, and be less likely to be viewed as “unappealingly eccentric and militant” than might have been the case only five years ago.</p>
<p>But when it comes to persuading other people to make necessary changes, it’s worth bearing in mind the potential power of humour, as well as fear, argues Jeff Niederdeppe at Cornell University’s Center for a Sustainable Future.</p>
<p>In 2018, he and a PhD student, Christofer Skurka, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/68/1/169/4858531?redirectedFrom=fulltext">worked with a theatre group to create a series of videos</a> featuring a weathercaster making forecasts about extreme weather patterns caused by climate change. One, the “ominous” version, highlighted the severity of climate change and its impacts. In another “humorously” silly version, the weathercaster seemed clueless as he struggled to understand the signs of climate change. A third was designed to be neutral in tone.</p>
<p>The “ominous” video, designed to inspire fear, was effective across the full age range of 18 to 30 years. But the humorous one worked well for the 18- to 24-year-olds, too. “The people who found it funny were more likely to want to plan or partake in activism, recycle more and believe climate change is risky,” Skurka reported.</p>
<p>Some people may mock Thunberg. Others may applaud her, though make no changes in their lives. Yet others will take her message to heart. It’s purely anecdotal evidence, of course, but the week after that particular UN address, someone on the Google mailing group for my own street, and a group of streets around mine, put out a message saying that they were concerned about climate change, and asking anyone who felt the same way to get in touch, to meet, to discuss what we as a small community can do. I’ve lost count of how many people have reacted to the thread. It’s true that I would have predicted that my particular neighbourhood would respond in that way. Around here, she was preaching to the converted — but those who needed an extra nudge.</p>
<p>Still, as so many studies, from those run by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication to the extreme weather videos experiments have shown, we’re different, and surely no one type of activism or activist will appeal to everyone. All kinds of voices will be needed to truly make a difference in 2020, and beyond.</p>

<img alt="Transplant nephrologist looking into microscope" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Doctor_microscope-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With the rising rates of obesity, type II diabetes and an aging population, the number of individuals developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing globally.  With more individuals seeking kidney transplantation, the gap between those waiting for a transplant, and available kidney allografts, is unfortunately widening. Efforts with more potent immunosuppressive agents, protocols with desensitization, educational efforts, altruistic donors, and swap programs have made live donor transplants more accessible.</p>
<p>However, the expansion of live donor programs alone cannot accommodate all those on transplant waiting lists so nephrology care providers are looking more closely at the practices of using deceased donor allografts. Many of these allografts are discarded following biopsy, due to disease or damage during organ procurement. Discard rates of up to 20% have been reported in the US.  The difference in discard rates in other countries such as the 9% rate in France raise the question about possible differences in criteria for discards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are we discarding too many kidneys?</p></blockquote>
<p>This week in <em><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo6_auqr05gIVCbLtCh1isAidEAAYASAAEgImAvD_BwE">BMC Nephrology</a></em>, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1664-8">Lee <em>et al.</em> reported</a> on a South Korean hospital’s experience of utilizing allografts from deceased donors over the age of 70, with creatinine levels of &gt;3.0mg/dl or GFR of less than 30mL/min. In these cases, both kidneys were transplanted into recipients that tended to be older and more likely to have co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes.  Though a small study of 15 cases of dual kidney transplants, versus 124 recipients of standard criteria donor (SCD) and 80 recipients of the expanded criteria donor (ECD), the positive results at least warrant the examination of current practices which can lead to discarding allografts. The groups had similar patient survival rates, nadir creatinine and time to nadir creatinine. This single center’s experience prompts the question – are we discarding too many kidneys that could provide older recipients with comorbidities possibly improving their survival compared to remaining on dialysis and a better quality of life?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11594" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Chess pieces" class="size-medium wp-image-11594" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Decisions_chess-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Recognition of the number of hepatitis C positive allografts that were being discarded due to the lack of Hepatitis C positive recipients led to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7326%2FM17-2871">work on</a> protocols allowing for transplantation into hepatitis C negative recipients while using new antiviral therapies. Beyond the development of new protocols, we need to look at current policies and regulations that may impact on the decisions by transplant centers to use certain organ offers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11595" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Doctor, stethoscope" class="size-medium wp-image-11595" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Doctor_Resized-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In the US, regulations by <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare Services (CMS)</a> help to protect patients by reporting patient and graft survival rates and how this could influence transplant centers to be less conservative about using those allografts from donors that are older and have more comorbidities. In a 2016 analysis of low-performance score transplant centers, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.13594">Schold <em>et al.</em></a> noted in subsequent years the outcomes would improve but this was accompanied by greater rate of patient removal from waiting lists (28.6 more removals /1000 year follow up, <em>p </em>&lt; 0.001) and from a drop in transplant rates (-11.9/1000 years follow up, <em>p </em>&lt; 0.001). While it is important to look at all allograft offers with a goal of a successful transplant, are we too quick or too conservative in our use of less than perfect kidneys?</p>

<p>La communauté scientifique est en effervescence à l’approche de la mise en place de la « <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/pid39124/loi-de-programmation-pluriannuelle-de-la-recherche.html">loi de programmation pluriannuelle de la recherche </a>» (LPPR). Au programme, entre autres : un renforcement de la mise en compétition des structures et des personnes par l’intermédiaire d’appels à projets, un renforcement de la précarisation (déjà très importante) par l’implémentation de la « tenure track », c’est-à-dire CDD de 5-7 ans pouvant (ou pas) mener à une titularisation, un accroissement de l’évaluation bureaucratique (c’est-à-dire par des objectifs chiffrés) des institutions et des personnes, une différenciation des rémunérations et des conditions de travail notamment par une politique de primes généralisée, un temps d’enseignement des enseignants-chercheurs non plus statutaire (192h équivalent-TD) mais « négocié » avec la direction, un renforcement de la recherche « partenariale » (c’est-à-dire au profit d’une entreprise) au détriment de la recherche fondamentale, et, globalement, un affaiblissement considérable de l’autonomie scientifique et universitaire.</p>
<p>Naturellement, ce projet suscite une inquiétude considérable dans la communauté académique, et de nombreuses critiques ont déjà été formulées, par le biais des institutions (qui ignorent ces critiques) mais également dans la presse. En passant : je parlerai par la suite de projet, de politique ou d’idéologie plutôt que de loi, car il est vraisemblable que l’essentiel du projet se passe du débat parlementaire. Les « tenure-tracks » par exemple, qui signent la mort annoncée des statuts de chargé de recherche et maître de conférences, <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/1217761189721268224?s=20">ont déjà été mis en place cette année</a> avant même la discussion de la loi, grâce à une disposition législative elle-même non discutée au Parlement, le CDI de projet (passée par ordonnances en 2017).</p>
<p>Beaucoup de choses ont été dites et écrites, mais les discussions tournent généralement autour de points spécifiques, sur chacune des mesures prises individuellement, et donc de manière réductionniste. Par exemple, concernant l’ANR qui finance désormais les projets de recherche, une partie de la communauté se focalise sur le faible taux de succès (10-15% selon les années), source en effet d’un énorme gâchis. Des voix s’élèvent donc pour augmenter le budget de l’ANR de façon à augmenter ce taux de succès. Or l’ANR finance en grande partie des postdocs, et augmenter son budget va donc mécaniquement entraîner une précarisation, précarisation qui suscite pourtant l’inquiétude de cette même communauté. Concernant la tenure track, si la communauté y est généralement opposée, certains y voient une évolution potentiellement positive « si c’est bien fait », en permettant par exemple des rémunérations plus attractives, comme le pouvoir l’annonce. C’est oublier que ce qui permet une augmentation des rémunérations, c’est soit une augmentation du budget (qui pourrait se faire sans précarisation) soit une diminution du nombre de recrutements. D’autres se disent que la tenure track (CDD puis titularisation conditionnelle) est un progrès par rapport au postdoc (CDD puis concours). C’est négliger deux choses : d’une, que la tenure track n’exclut pas le postdoc, qui reste la norme dans tous les pays qui implémentent la tenure track ; d’autre part, que les chances de titularisation dépendent non des mots employés par les autorités pour faire la publicité de la réforme (« engagement moral »), mais du budget rapporté au nombre de candidats. Etant donné que le concours CNRS, pour prendre un exemple, a un taux de succès de 4%, de deux choses l’une : soit la tenure track va avoir un taux de sélection comparable, auquel cas la différence principale avec le système actuel sera la précarité du contrat ; soit le taux de titularisation sera comparable, auquel cas l’effet principal sera de reculer de 5-7 ans l’âge de la sélection pour un poste stable ; ou bien sûr, le plus probable, un intermédiaire : taux de sélection de 8%, taux de titularisation de 50%.</p>
<p>Enfin concernant les « CDIs de projet », c’est-à-dire une mesure essentiellement technique permettant de mettre en place des CDDs plus longs que ceux autorisés par la loi, nombreux sont ceux, en particulier en biologie, qui voient cette mesure d’un bon œil. La raison est la loi Sauvadet censée résorber la précarité, qui impose à l’employeur de titulariser les personnels en CDD depuis plusieurs années. Mais comme l’Etat ne veut pas titulariser, cela signifie que les institutions refusent de prolonger les CDDs au-delà d’une certaine limite. Cela est perçu à juste titre comme un gâchis par de nombreux chercheurs, car il se produit souvent une situation dans laquelle un laboratoire dispose des fonds pour prolonger le contrat d’un postdoc expérimenté, mais est contrainte administrativement de recruter à la place un postdoc inexpérimenté. Cependant, de manière plus globale, l’effet de la mise en place de CDIs de projet est mécaniquement un allongement de la durée des postdocs, donc une titularisation (ou non) plus tardive, assortie éventuellement d’une diminution du nombre de postdocs - à moins que le taux de succès de l’ANR augmente par une augmentation de budget.</p>
<p>En résumé, une analyse réductionniste ne permet pas de former une critique cohérente. Elle tend à naturaliser le fonctionnement des institutions, c’est-à-dire à considérer par exemple que le financement par projet de la recherche est une sorte de loi de la nature plutôt qu’une construction sociale (d’où la référence constante aux « standards internationaux »). Or il s’agit bien entendu de politiques choisies, et dans le cas de la France assez récemment. C’est pourquoi il me semble important de prendre un peu de recul pour analyser cette nouvelle politique de manière globale, y compris dans le contexte plus large des politiques publiques.</p>

<li><em> L’idéologie générale : le nouveau management public</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Antoine Petit, PDG du CNRS, a brillamment résumé l’inspiration idéologique de la LPPR: il s’agira d’une loi « <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/sciences-prospective/la-recherche-une-arme-pour-les-combats-du-futur-1150759">darwinienne </a>». Cette terminologie n’a pas manqué de susciter de vives critiques de la part de la communauté scientifique (<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2019/12/06/le-darwinisme-social-applique-a-la-recherche-est-une-absurdite_6021868_3232.html">ici</a> et <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2019/12/23/francois-xavier-fauvelle-monsieur-le-pdg-du-cnrs-savez-vous-ce-que-votre-darwinisme-fait-a-la-recherche_6023835_3232.html">là</a>). Il s’agit de mettre en compétition des institutions et des personnes sur la base d’objectifs décidés par l’Etat, et « que le meilleur gagne ». Cette référence n’est absolument pas anecdotique, contrairement à ce que Mme Vidal et M. Petit ont essayé d’expliquer de manière peu convaincante par la suite. Il s’agit d’une forme de gestion publique qui n’est ni improvisée ni spécifique à la recherche, et qui a été théorisée sous le nom de <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_gestion_publique"><em>nouveau management public</em></a>. Il s’agit non plus d’organiser les services publics par la mise en place raisonnée d’infrastructures publiques, de manière spécifique à chaque mission (une approche perçue comme « soviétique » et donc inefficace), mais en mettant en compétition diverses institutions, qui sont « libres » de mettre en place les moyens qu’ils jugent nécessaires pour accomplir des objectifs chiffrés fixés par l’Etat. Ces objectifs peuvent être par exemple la position dans un classement international des universités, ou la durée moyenne de séjour dans les hôpitaux. C’est le sens du mot « autonomie » dans l’« <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_relative_aux_libert%C3%A9s_et_responsabilit%C3%A9s_des_universit%C3%A9s">autonomie des universités </a>» instaurée par Nicolas Sarkozy en 2007. Naturellement, il ne s’agit pas d’autonomie scientifique, puisque celle-ci suppose précisément un financement inconditionnel (c’est-à-dire emploi garanti et budget récurrent), ni d’autonomie financière puisque les financements restent versés par l’Etat, sous condition d’objectifs fixés par l’Etat. Il s’agit d’une autonomie de méthode, pour accomplir des objectifs fixés préalablement par l’Etat.</p>
<p>Naturellement, cette mise en compétition au niveau des structures (e.g. universités) se décline de manière hiérarchique jusqu’à l’échelle individuelle, puisque pour survivre, la structure doit faire en sorte que les employés contribuent à la réalisation des objectifs. C’est pourquoi il est en permanence question d’instaurer une « culture du résultat » ou de l’évaluation. Cet appel à la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9volution_culturelle">révolution culturelle</a> qui évoque le maoïsme est d’ailleurs tout à fait significatif, j’y reviendrai.</p>
<p>Cette idéologie n’est ni spécifique à la recherche, ni naturellement à la France. Son instigatrice la plus connue est Mme Thatcher, qui l’a mise en place au Royaume-Uni dans les années 80. Elle a également été mise en place par le régime nazi dans les années 1930, <a href="https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/la-grande-table-idees/du-crime-nazi-au-management-moderne-une-histoire-commune">comme l’a montré l’historien Johann Chapoutot</a> - j’y reviendrai. Son bilan, pour dire un euphémisme, n’est pas fameux (voir par exemple un <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00101-9">compte rendu très récent dans Nature</a> d’une étude dans le monde académique). Pour ce qui est de la santé, par exemple, sa mise en place en France par le biais de la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarification_%C3%A0_l%27activit%C3%A9">tarification à l’activité</a> (T2A) a conduit aujourd’hui à une <a href="https://www.marianne.net/societe/crise-des-urgences-l-appel-des-parents-pour-sauver-la-reanimation-pediatrique">situation dramatique</a> - j’y reviendrai également.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em> Une politique libérale ?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il est important de bien situer cette idéologie sur l’échiquier politique. En effet, elle est souvent perçue (et présentée) comme une idéologie d’inspiration libérale. Il est d’ailleurs tout à fait plausible que ses défenseurs la pensent ainsi de manière sincère - bien sûr dans les démocraties libérales modernes, et peut-être pas au sein du IIIe Reich qui l’implémentait également. C’est un malentendu qui est source d’une grande confusion, et qui explique son soutien électoral de la part de citoyens de sensibilité centriste - que sont une bonne partie des chercheurs.</p>
<p>La filiation avec la pensée libérale se fait, on l’a compris, par l’idée de l’efficience du marché. Le marché serait un outil productif efficace en cela qu’il permettrait, par la libre opération des producteurs et la sélection par les consommateurs, de faire émerger les solutions les plus efficaces. D’où l’essence « darwinienne » de ces idées (dans le sens bien sûr des croyances populaires, et non du Darwinisme en biologie qui n’est absolument pas individualiste). Cette efficience émergerait naturellement de la libre opération des marchés dans un contexte marchand (j’invite néanmoins le lecteur à lire <a href="https://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-dette-5000-ans-d-histoire-de-david-graeber">ce que pensent les anthropologues</a> du présupposé naturaliste des économistes sur la monnaie et l’échange marchand). Le libéralisme économique, par conséquent, préconise de réduire l’intervention de l’Etat au strict nécessaire, et peut être associé (ou pas) au libéralisme politique, en particulier la protection des libertés individuelles. Le marché est vu comme un moyen optimal de distribuer l’information dans une économie - bien sûr, aucun économiste sérieux ne considère plus aujourd’hui que les marchés réels se comportent ou puissent se comporter comme les « marchés parfaits » de l’économie néoclassique (voir par exemple le travail de <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_E._Stiglitz">J. Stiglitz</a>). Dans un contexte de guerre froide, ce type d’organisation économique se pense en opposition avec la planification soviétique, qui serait bureaucratique, « sclérosante ».</p>
<p>On touche ici à un problème épistémologique essentiel, sur lequel je reviendrai plus tard, qui constitue l’erreur intellectuelle fondamentale du nouveau management public. En effet, si l’on conçoit qu’un marché puisse exister naturellement dans le cadre d’échanges commerciaux où il existe une métrique objective, l’argent, ce n’est a priori pas le cas de la santé, la science, la justice ou la police. Il faut donc créer ces métriques, par exemple : la durée de séjour, le nombre de publications, le nombre de jugements, le nombre d’amendes. Ces métriques et les objectifs qui y sont associés n’existant pas de manière naturelle (peut-on quantifier la vérité, ou la justice ?), ils doivent être créés par l’Etat. Cela suppose donc la création d’une bureaucratie d’Etat.</p>
<p>On arrive donc à un étonnant paradoxe : alors que le libéralisme est un courant de pensée fondamentalement anti-bureaucratique, on est ici en présence d’une doctrine qui préconise la mise en place d’une bureaucratie d’Etat. C’est en effet une constatation et une plainte récurrentes de tous les chercheurs et universitaires français depuis la mise en place, ces quinze dernières années, de politiques de ce type : alors même qu’il s’agissait officiellement de « moderniser » un appareil d’enseignement et de recherche jugé bureaucratique, « sclérosé », voire proto-soviétique (en particulier dans le cas du CNRS), de l’avis de tous la bureaucratie a au contraire considérablement envahi la vie quotidienne de ces professions, par le biais des multiples appels d’offres et procédures d’évaluation, mais également des nouvelles structures administratives qui ont été créées pour organiser le marché de l’excellence scientifique (HCERES, pôles d’excellence, fusion d’universités, IDEX/LABEX/EQUIPEX/IHU, etc). Ceci se manifeste également dans l’emploi public, puisqu’alors même que le recrutement de chercheurs, d’enseignants-chercheurs et de techniciens est en forte baisse, <a href="http://blog.educpros.fr/guillaume-miquelard-et-paul-francois/2016/08/16/lagence-nationale-de-la-recherche-anr/">l’emploi administratif et donc le coût de gestion</a> ont littéralement explosé au sein de l’ANR, agence chargée d’organiser l’évaluation des appels d’offre en recherche. De même, dans l’hôpital public, une plainte récurrente des médecins concerne le temps considérable qu’ils doivent désormais passer au « codage », c’est-à-dire à assigner à chaque patient et chaque acte des codes issus d’une nomenclature bureaucratique. Cette bureaucratisation n’est pas un accident, comme je l’indiquais précédemment. Elle a été par ailleurs décrite dans le contexte plus large du néolibéralisme par les sciences sociales (voir par exemple le travail de <a href="http://www.editionslesliensquiliberent.fr/livre-Bullshit_Jobs-546-1-1-0-1.html">D. Graeber</a> et de <a href="https://editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-La_bureaucratisation_n__olib__rale-9782707176493.html">B. Hibou</a>).</p>
<p>Manifestement, cette idéologie prétendument libérale est une idéologie bureaucratique, ce qui n’est déjà pas rien. Deuxièmement, le rôle de l’Etat n’est plus du tout d’assurer les libertés individuelles. En effet, dans un marché classique, d’échange marchand, ce qui est produit est décidé de manière autonome (en théorie du moins) par les acteurs de ce marché, c’est-à-dire en dernière analyse (en théorie encore) par les consommateurs. Il faut donc assurer la liberté individuelle de ces acteurs. Or dans le nouveau management public, ce qui est produit est décidé par l’Etat, spécifiquement par la bureaucratie mise en place par l’Etat pour fixer les objectifs, qui utilise la mise en compétition uniquement comme outil de gestion. Il ne s’agit donc absolument plus d’assurer la liberté individuelle des acteurs, qui doivent fournir ce qui leur est demandé par la bureaucratie. Ceux qui ne le font pas doivent quitter le système (exemple du tenure track). C’est ainsi qu’un des points majeurs de ces réformes, en particulier dans la recherche, est de revenir sur le statut de fonctionnaire, qui assure l’autonomie scientifique et universitaire, de façon à pouvoir soumettre les employés à la bureaucratie locale (direction d’université) ou nationale (ministère). Paradoxalement, c’est au nom du libéralisme que l’on attaque les libertés académiques.</p>
<p>On est donc en présence d’une idéologie qui est fondamentalement bureaucratique, et qui n’entend pas garantir les libertés individuelles. Pour ce qui est du libéralisme politique, on ne peut que constater également qu’il n’y a pas grand-chose de libéral dans la pratique actuelle des institutions politiques (avec par exemple le recours généralisé aux ordonnances pour passer des réformes majeures), dans la <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/01/11/les-violences-policieres-sont-le-reflet-d-un-echec_6025530_3232.html">répression violente des opposants politiques</a>, dans <a href="https://rsf.org/fr/actualites/violences-commises-envers-les-journalistes-en-france-rsf-lance-un-cri-dalarme">l’intimidation des journalistes</a>, dans la volonté de <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2020/01/16/lettre-commune-contre-la-loi-haine/">censurer les réseaux sociaux</a>, dans la <a href="http://www.sauvonsluniversite.com/spip.php?article8599">restriction de la liberté d’expression des étudiants et universitaires</a>, ou encore dans le <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/medias/la-reconnaissance-faciale-debarque-en-france-et-vous-ny-echapperez-pas,n6459175.php">déploiement de la reconnaissance faciale</a> automatique par l’Etat.</p>
<p>Que reste-t-il donc du libéralisme dans cette idéologie ? Peu de choses en effet. C’est la raison pour laquelle les historiens, <a href="https://editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-La_bureaucratisation_n__olib__rale-9782707176493.html">sociologues</a> et <a href="http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Il-faut-s-adapter">philosophes</a> parlent de néolibéralisme (à ne pas confondre avec l’ultralibéralisme), et c’est également la raison pour laquelle ses partisans refusent typiquement cette étiquette de manière véhémente, quand bien même il s’agit d’une dénomination savante, parce qu’elle indique que l’on a affaire à tout à fait autre chose que du libéralisme. Ce malentendu sur la nature prétendument libérale (au sens classique) de cette idéologie est source de grande confusion. Il explique peut-être l’opposition quasi-systématique d’une grande partie de la population à des réformes pourtant portées par des gouvernements centristes élus, y compris élus par des membres du monde académique qui se considèrent de centre gauche.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em> L’obscurantisme managérial</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il existe pour les universitaires et chercheurs une raison spécifique de s’opposer à cette idéologie, en lien avec l’éthique intellectuelle qu’ils entendent défendre par leur métier. Il s’agit en effet d’une idéologie qui repose sur une argumentation d’un niveau intellectuel affligeant (suite de poncifs et de préjugés non étayés), des analogies douteuses (le marché, voire le darwinisme), et un refus de toute évaluation empirique (depuis son application, l’hôpital public est en crise grave et la recherche française tombe dans les classements mis en avant par les autorités elles-mêmes). Autrement dit, une idéologie obscurantiste tendant vers le sectaire. Les discours portant cette idéologie font rire toute la communauté académique tellement ils sont caricaturaux de novlangue : tout doit être « excellent », il faut faire « sauter des verrous », favoriser « l’innovation disruptive ». Il faut consulter l’hilarant site de <a href="http://excellagence.fr/">l’Agence Nationale de l’Excellence Scientifique</a>, parodiant l’Agence Nationale de la Recherche.</p>
<p>Il vaut mieux en rire, sans doute, mais ces discours n’en sont pas moins affligeants. L’argumentation que l’on retrouve dans les rapports officiels et les contrats d’objectifs des différentes institutions ne sont malheureusement pas d’un niveau intellectuel plus élevé. Il s’agirait par exemple de s’aligner sur les « standards internationaux » - un mimétisme censé favorisé l’innovation, ce qui est assez croustillant. On ne s’est visiblement pas posé la question de dresser un bilan de ces politiques menées à l’étranger ou en France, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00101-9">qui n’est pourtant pas brillant</a>. Quelle est donc la justification en ce qui concerne l’enseignement supérieur et la recherche ? On peut la paraphraser ainsi : puisque ces politiques ont été implémentées dans les pays anglo-saxons, en particulier les Etats-Unis, et que les Etats-Unis sont leaders dans tous les classements, c’est donc que ces politiques sont efficaces : il faut donc s’empresser de copier ce modèle.</p>
<p>N’importe quel scientifique devrait bondir face à une telle argumentation qui mélange corrélation et causation de la manière la plus grossière qui soit. On aurait pu se dire : tiens, les Etats-Unis étant politiquement hégémoniques, toute la science se fait dans leur langue maternelle, dans des revues toutes anglo-saxonnes, et qui plus est avec des moyens sans commune mesure avec les budgets français. Peut-être que ces facteurs ont une petite influence ? On aurait pu se dire : tiens, peut-être que les grandes universités américaines sont mondialement connues au-delà du monde académique, alors que l’Ecole Polytechnique pas tellement, parce que les Etats-Unis sont culturellement hégémoniques, de sorte que Legally Blonde a été tourné à Harvard et pas à Assas ? Auquel cas il ne serait peut-être pas si pertinent de faire tellement d’efforts à renommer toutes les universités parisiennes en déclinant la marque Sorbonne ? On aurait pu se dire encore : tiens, peut-être que les Etats-Unis ont un excellent vivier scientifique précisément parce que des pays comme la France imposent à tous leurs meilleurs docteurs de passer plusieurs années aux Etats-Unis pour se former parmi les meilleurs, se « faire un réseau », apprendre l’anglais, comme condition pour une éventuelle titularisation dans leur pays d’origine ? Mais, on ne s’est rien dit de tout ça. Ce qui marche, c’est le « marché » et la compétition généralisée. Point.</p>
<p>Sur certains points, il existe des études scientifiques qui vont au-delà des sophismes managériaux. Par exemple, est-il plus efficace de concentrer les ressources sur les « meilleurs » ? Même si l’on adopte les critères bureaucratiques promus par l’idéologie managériale (nombre de publications, etc), la réponse est, selon plusieurs études sur des données différentes : non. Il est plus efficace de diversifier les financements que de les concentrer en créant de grosses structures (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686789/">Fortin &amp; Curie, 2013</a> ; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465944/">Cook et al., 2015</a> ; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07396">Mongeon et al., 2016</a> ; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882298/">Wahls, 2018</a>). D’autres études montrent que la sélection sur projet n’est que faiblement prédictive de l’impact scientifique, tel que mesuré par ces mêmes politiques (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/13323v1">Fang et al., 2016</a> ; <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/13.WB.017">Scheiner &amp; Bouchie, 2013</a>). Manifestement, les décideurs politiques de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche ne sont pas intéressés par l’évaluation empirique de leurs théories. Il est donc approprié de qualifier cette attitude d’obscurantiste. Et on ne peut pas, on ne doit pas, en tant que scientifiques (au sens large), respecter l’obscurantisme, c’est-à-dire le mépris de l’éthique intellectuelle qui fait l’essence de notre métier.</p>
<p>Il est important de noter que ces politiques se présentent volontiers comme « rationnelles » - il ne s’agirait finalement que de dérouler des arguments peut-être déplaisants mais « logiques ». Ce mot, « rationnel », devrait être un signal d’alarme pour tous les intellectuels. Car un intellectuel doit savoir que la logique, la raison, se déploient nécessairement au sein d’un certain modèle du monde. Par conséquent, la vérité d’un raisonnement est conditionnée à la pertinence empirique et théorique de ce modèle. C’est pourquoi l’essence de la science (au sens large) est le débat argumenté, documenté et honnête, c’est-à-dire explicitant les hypothèses, épaulé par les institutions sociales adéquates (comme la revue par les pairs). Passer sous silence cet aspect, et prétendre qu’il existerait une Vérité objective, c’est faire preuve de sectarisme, et en effet d’obscurantisme puisque cela suppose d’ignorer délibérément toute production savante contraire à la doxa.</p>
<p>L’enjeu pour la communauté académique, donc, n’est pas simplement d’aménager à la marge des réformes prétendument démocratiques (augmenter le taux de succès de l’ANR) ou de les « négocier » (on accepte la précarisation en échange de primes), mais de s’opposer à l’obscurantisme qui fonde ces projets, et éventuellement de penser autre chose à la place.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em> Pensée bureaucratique et idéologies sectaires</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Il faut rappeler ici qu’avant la guerre froide, la bureaucratie a volontiers été présentée sur un mode laudatif. Le sociologue Max Weber, par exemple, considérait en se référant à la bureaucratie industrielle qu’il s’agissait là d’un mode particulièrement efficace de production, rationnel. De même la planification soviétique était pensée comme une approche scientifique, rationnelle, de la production (algorithmique, pourrait-on peut-être dire en langage moderne). La bureaucratie instituée par le nouveau management public n’échappe pas à ce type de discours. Je reviendrai plus tard sur les raisons fondamentales pour laquelle l’approche bureaucratique ne peut pas fonctionner pour des activités telles que la science (ou la santé). Un point intéressant relevé par l’historien Johann Chapoutot est que les politiques similaires au nouveau management public menées par le IIIe Reich étaient, contrairement à l’image d’efficacité que l’on en a à cause de la propagande nazie, en réalité tout à fait inefficaces, chaotiques.</p>
<p>J’ai mentionné rapidement les similarités idéologiques, naturellement sur certains aspects uniquement, avec la politique nazie et avec la bureaucratie soviétique. J’ai également mentionné en passant l’inquiétante insistance des dirigeants politiques à instaurer une « culture du résultat », c’est-à-dire qu’il s’agit non seulement d’instaurer de nouvelles structures étatiques, mais également de transformer les individus pour qu’ils embrassent la nouvelle orientation politique. Ce n’est pas sans rappeler la « révolution culturelle » maoïste, visant à éradiquer les valeurs culturelles traditionnelles (naturellement, avec des moyens violents que je ne prétends pas comparer à l’action publique actuelle).</p>
<p>Pour qu’il n’y ait pas de malentendu, il ne s’agit pas de dire que la théorie du nouveau management public est une idéologie nazie, ou stalinienne, ou maoïste (celles-ci étant de toutes façons incompatibles). D’ailleurs, il semble plausible que M. Petit, lorsqu’il considère maladroitement que la loi doit être inégalitaire et « darwinienne », ignore qu’il formule là la doctrine du <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinisme_social">darwinisme social</a>, un fondement essentiel du néolibéralisme <a href="http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Il-faut-s-adapter">comme l’a montré la philosophe Barbara Stiegler</a>, mais également un des fondements idéologiques du nazisme. Il n’est pas question ici de mettre sur le même plan les horreurs commises au nom de ces courants de pensée avec la destruction des constructions sociales commises au nom du nouveau management public. Néanmoins, sur un plan intellectuel, les points communs avec ces idéologies sectaires doivent nous interroger. Il existe bien un recouvrement idéologique partiel dont on peut tout à fait comprendre les aspects problématiques. Par exemple, la promotion de la compétition généralisée des individus dans un but supérieur, les individus eux-mêmes n’ayant de valeur que dans la mesure où ils contribuent à la puissance de la Nation (ainsi la référence constante à la compétition internationale, aux classements internationaux, aux « stars » qu’il faudrait attirer) ; position qui rend inopérant tout argument de type social (par exemple la précarisation extrême du métier de chercheur), mais aussi scientifique (c’est-à-dire que le but premier de la science est la recherche de la vérité et non la production). Il ne s’agit donc pas de nazisme, de maoïsme ou stalinisme, mais il reviendra néanmoins aux défenseurs de ce projet politique d’argumenter que « tout n’est pas à jeter » dans ces grandes idéologies sectaires. Que toute activité sociale doit contribuer exclusivement à la production de la Nation. Que les opinions et attitudes des gens doivent être transformées pour le bien de la Nation. Que la bureaucratie, c’est efficace et rationnel.</p>
<p>En résumé, il ne faut pas passer à côté des enjeux de la transformation en cours de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de discuter du taux optimal de succès à l’ANR mais de contester la pertinence du projet comme mode essentiel d’organisation de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de discuter des métriques les plus pertinentes pour évaluer les personnes, mais de contester l’organisation profondément bureaucratique que cette « culture de l’évaluation » suppose, et de réaffirmer l’autonomie académique nécessaire à l’exercice de la recherche. Il ne s’agit pas de savoir comment au mieux renforcer l’« attractivité internationale » du métier, mais de contester l’idée d’un progrès scientifique fondé essentiellement sur la compétition et la sélection - plutôt que, par exemple, sur la coopération, l’éducation et le partage. Il ne s’agit pas, enfin, de se demander comment favoriser au mieux l’« innovation de rupture », mais de contester l’idée selon laquelle l’activité scientifique doit être subordonnée à la production marchande.</p>
<p>Il s’agit donc en premier lieu de dénoncer l’obscurantisme et le sectarisme qui fondent ces réformes, et non de les négocier en acceptant leurs présupposés. En second lieu, il s’agira de penser les questions centrales de science et d’université dans un cadre intellectuel libéré du sectarisme managérial.</p>
<p>Toutes ces remarques sont finalement assez peu spécifiques de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche. Par la suite, je tenterai de rentrer dans une discussion plus spécifique, en particulier sur la nécessaire autonomie de la science, à mettre en regard avec la culture du projet.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Researchers from tech company DeepMind have drawn inspiration from their own AI research to develop a new theory of how reinforcement learning works in the brain. </strong>Dopamine neurons respond to the difference between a predicted reward and the reward that an animal actually receives: so if the reward is greater than predicted, for instance, more dopamine will be released. But the team found that dopamine neurons in mice don’t all produce the same level of response, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2230327-deepmind-found-an-ai-learning-technique-also-works-in-human-brains/">reports Donna Lu at </a><em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2230327-deepmind-found-an-ai-learning-technique-also-works-in-human-brains/">New Scientist</a> — </em>instead, they show a distribution of responses, similar to techniques used in machine learning.</p>

<p><strong>The parasite <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>can only reproduce in the digestive tract of cats, so it’s developed an ingenious solution: when it infects the brains of rats and mice, it makes them less scared of felines. But a new study suggests that <em>T. gondii</em> isn’t the “genius” it was previously believed to be</strong>. Instead, researchers have found that the parasite causes rodents to lose fear towards predators generally, rather than cats specifically, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/brain-parasite-may-strip-away-rodents-fear-predators-not-just-cats">reports Kelly Servick at <em>Science</em></a> <em>—</em> though not everyone is convinced by the findings.</p>

<p><strong>An increasing body of psychological literature suggests that meditation and mindfulness may boost feelings of empathy and altruism (</strong><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/12/the-psychology-of-mindfulness-digested/"><strong>though it is not without its downsides</strong></a><strong>).</strong> If that’s the case, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/10/21013234/meditation-brain-neuroscience-moral-obligation">asks Sigal Samuel at <em>Vox</em></a>, do we all have a moral obligation to start meditating?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>“Super-recognisers” <em>—</em> people who are particularly adept at recognising faces <em>—</em> are often employed by the police and border agencies. But recent studies reveal their skills are limited when it comes to recognising people of different ethnic groups. </strong>Researchers found that white super-recognisers were better than white controls at recognising Egyptian and Asian faces <em>—</em> but they were still worse than native Egyptian or Asian non-super-recognisers. “[A]gencies seeking to recruit super-recognisers will see a performance boost,” <a href="https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-research-reveals-new-abilities-of-super-recognisers-128414">write the researchers at </a><em><a href="https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-research-reveals-new-abilities-of-super-recognisers-128414">The Conversation</a>. “</em>But if they are assessing a particular ethnic group, they will need to seek the help of native observers as well.”</p>

<p><strong>“Environmental issues are not just technical challenges that can be solved with a new invention. To tackle climate change we will need insight from psychology and sociology.

Please also consider voicing your support on social media with the hashtag #OAintheUSA.</em></p>
<p>Dear President Trump,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned organizations, represent leading publishers and non-profit scientific and scholarly societies registered in the United States, or with employees in the United States. We write to you in support of the proposed Administration policy that would mandate immediate open distribution of peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on federally-funded research. We also write to call into question some of the points made in the letter from the Association of American Publishers (AAP) dated December 18, 2019, and to make clear that not all American publishers support the position of this AAP letter.</p>
<p>As organizations involved in the coordination, organization, enhancement, and dissemination of peer-reviewed research, we work in close collaboration with the stakeholders funding research, the stakeholders performing research, and the stakeholders reading research. All of these groups have a say in how scientific publishing should work, and all of these groups include the U.S. Federal Government and the researchers it funds.</p>
<p>Our business interests are important, but must be considered in the context of this nation’s collaborative research industry and community. If an important change that benefits the American taxpaying public emerges, it is up to stakeholders to support it, even if it includes some change and some risk. This is one of the pillars of the American work ethic — innovation and perseverance during change.</p>
<p>We the undersigned all operate, or partner with, successful publishing businesses which have pioneered, or are transitioning to, the new open publishing paradigm. We all consider the immediate and open dissemination of federally-funded research a priority, and we enable it via effective business models. There is nothing about the immediate availability of research that precludes publishing companies — commercial or nonprofit — from continuing to do business if they work hard, innovate, and collaborate. In fact, the immediate and open availability of research is an important prerequisite to another Administration priority — the Artificial Intelligence (AI) readiness of federally-funded research to maintain and “drive growth of the United States economy, enhance our economic and national security, and improve our quality of life.”</p>
<p>The Federal Government has long funded research that triggers further innovation and economic development when it can be built upon. The entrepreneurial ecosystem enabled by opening access to this research far outweighs its economic value as intellectual property of selected publishing companies and societies. Therefore we take issue with the notion from the AAP letter that it is the business success of a group of publishers that best showcases the strength of American science and research. As the AAP letter states, “the role of the publisher is to advance scholarship and innovation, fostering the American leadership in science that drives our economy and global competitiveness.” However, our approach will serve this agenda more fully. The U.S. will best lead the world by showcasing its research for everyone, including the Americans taxpayers who have funded it, to learn from and build on. You cannot showcase the quality of federally-funded research to its full potential by limiting access to it.</p>
<p>Additionally, the value and benefits of opening up research to be read and built upon should by now be self-evident: consider doctors dealing with disease outbreaks needing the most up-to-date information possible; patients making informed healthcare choices; teachers and students, wherever they are, accessing the wealth of US-funded knowledge; small business owners accessing the cutting edge of technology; farmers understanding the most recent research on crops. These are, as a reminder, also the people who have funded the research with their tax dollars.</p>
<p>A peer-reviewed article, whether published via an AAP signatory, or a signatory of this letter, is ultimately authored and peer-reviewed by the same research community. There is nothing, therefore, contained in your proposed policy that jeopardizes the quality and integrity of American research. This research will continue to be performed and peer-reviewed by the same people, to the same high standards as before — it will simply be disseminated for the benefit of the American people and the entire research community more cost-effectively, immediately, and openly.</p>
<p>Such executive orders or policies do not “undermine” the marketplace. The Federal Government, as a funder and participant in the American research community, is an integral part of this marketplace and is free to state its priorities. We, the undersigned, look forward to continued collaboration with the Federal Government, and researchers supported by it, and to continuing to disseminate the outcomes of this world-class activity as openly as possible.</p>
<p>We support this policy and urge you to put the needs and rights of the research community and American taxpaying public first, and help us serve this community in the way it clearly wishes to be served.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/V0r5mKoF8tk/">Peer Review in Service of Open Science</a></h4>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we think about Open Science, sharing a diverse array of research products—such as data, code, methods, reagents—immediately comes to mind. More fundamentally, Open Science is about the entire process of conducting and communicating science according to long-established norms. Openness is </span><a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/sape/2012-06-20-saoe.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the heart of scientific enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scientists adopt open practices to allow collaboration and critical scrutiny, so that knowledge can be validated and built upon for the common good. The publishing process should be a central element ensuring that these norms are maintained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve considered how our submission and peer-review processes at PLOS can be improved upon to facilitate Open Science: we have made several changes over the past year and a half and we continue to explore new possibilities. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>BUILDING BLOCKS OF AN OPEN PROCESS</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Start with a preprint!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year and a half ago, we introduced a new step in the submission process: we ask authors if they have deposited a preprint and if they haven’t, we offer to do it on their behalf. We have </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered with bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deposit preprints after they have been screened by our staff—to make sure they are in scope and there are no ethical concerns or sensitive information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being open about a manuscript when it is submitted rather than published can make researchers wary (as some authors indicate in our surveys) but it does offer many </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It creates opportunities for collaboration and it helps researchers show their work before it is published, which is particularly important for those needing to demonstrate productivity for a thesis, or a job or grant application. Releasing a preprint has </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article. At the moment, close to 20% of manuscripts considered at PLOS have a preprint at submission (compared to </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256298#.Xh_OaBdKg0o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3% across PubMed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with some communities particularly embracing this aspect of Open Science (e.g., over 50% of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Computational Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submissions are preprinted). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to share a pre-print of an article via bioRxiv allows for other researchers to start building off your findings…without delay. Furthermore, the open-access nature of the bioRxiv pre-prints opens the peer-review process to the entire scientific community, thus facilitating the incorporation of constructive feedback into your work.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Nathan Robinson, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Author</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Publish peer reviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer review occupies an important function in the culture of objective critique that characterizes Open Science. The back and forth between authors and reviewers helps to validate claims and improve their reporting—it is a service to authors and readers alike. Exposing what happens during peer review increases the value of this exchange for all. Volunteer reviewers, along with editors, provide an enormous service to the scientific community; publishing the peer review history (with a DOI for unambiguous citation) is a step towards having this activity recognized and peer review reports viewed as a first-rate academic output. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May of last year, we launched the option for authors to publish the full </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside their article. While we hope that the community will gradually move to more openness, our initial implementation allows reviewers to remain anonymous, and lets authors opt in at acceptance, when the peer review has been concluded. We are heartened by the response—within six months of launching the option, an average of 40% of authors opt in across all journals, with 60-70% opt-in rate in certain disciplines, and 55% of published peer review packages have at least one named reviewer. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open peer review helps build public trust in the process by removing the mystery of secret academic peer review, as well as showing the robustness of the method in action.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Thomas Shafee, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> Author</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>CONTINUING TO RETHINK PEER REVIEW</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all its important functions, peer review remains imperfect and faces new challenges. It is increasingly difficult for only two to three reviewers to evaluate all aspects of complex interdisciplinary manuscripts.  Expanding the group of experts who provide feedback would likely be beneficial in many cases but is difficult in practice. In addition, the process is prone to delays and redundancy when a manuscript goes through multiple rounds of revision—either within a journal or more commonly through successive cycles of submission – review – revision – rejection at different journals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these building blocks in place—publishing preprints and peer review history—we have started to  experiment with new peer review ideas. Through 2020 we will be tracking the progress of three new initiatives: </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>1. From a peer review workflow that supports preprints to a preprint workflow that supports peer review</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are facilitating the deposition of preprints; can we close the loop and harness in the peer review process the attention that other experts are paying to the preprint? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking this question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on four PLOS journals now. We alert authors at submission that when  comments are posted on their preprint, we will bring them to the attention of the handling editor.  According to </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bioRxiv survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 37% of respondents received comments on their preprints via email. We hope that with the understanding that their comments may help and accelerate peer review, commentators will be more willing to make these comments public on bioRxiv. The comments do not need to be full blown reviews, but perhaps relevant examination of specific aspects—statistics, methodology, code, etc. As we surface a more diverse array of comments to the editors, and also point to comments on twitter, </span><a href="https://www.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PREreview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://prelights.biologists.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preLights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (two third-party sites providing reviews of preprints), we will examine the impact of this diversity on the experience of authors and editors. </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>2. Journal-independent peer review to reduce reviewer burden</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five PLOS journals are </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new service by EMBO Press and ASAPbio that offers journal-independent peer review. With a round of reviews in hand, authors might be better equipped to select a journal, and all participating journals commit to using the service’s reviews to expedite publication decisions. Authors may also decide that their manuscript is sufficiently validated and use Review Commons’s service to post peer reviews on bioRxiv. We look forward to learning about new behaviors and understanding how peer review of preprints can be most effective—with or without a journal publication outcome. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>3. Peer reviewing the experimental plan</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2020/01/14/registered-reports-are-coming-to-plos-one/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they will be offering Registered Reports as an option for publishing hypothesis-testing studies. This article type, with two stages of peer review and subsequent publications, is particularly important </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02674-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to avoid publication bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By segmenting peer review into two stages, the authors get early feedback on their initial research plan in order to craft a robust and reproducible study design before they begin their investigation, and they also get a guarantee that their results will be published in the journal so long as they adhere to the study protocol. Registered reports provide greater transparency in assessment criteria, minimize biases and help make the entire research process more open by revealing key stages of work, earlier.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>OPEN QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three initiatives examine different aspects of peer review. We hope to learn about the effectiveness of different models and attitudes towards them, in order to design improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are encouraged to be in good company in this experimentation—consider the twelve other community-based journals participating in </span><a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the registry of initiatives </span><a href="https://reimaginereview.asapbio.org/explore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reimagine Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintained by </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASAPbio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/e9091cea/peer-review-new-initiatives-to-enhance-the-value-of-elife-s-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiatives from eLife</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vision </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">articulated by HHMI leadership about the future of publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting question for all to consider remains how to express the substance of peer review in ways that help readers make decisions about what to read, to incorporate into their own research, and to inform research assessment. The current overreliance on journal name is problematic because in so many ways it is a blunt tool, inadequate for representing the richness of evaluation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is much more we can learn about how to improve peer review and how we can distill the journal process and reapply it in valuable ways—and it is our duty as publishers to continue this exploration for the benefit of all. </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/shopper-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With consumers now more health conscious than ever before, nutrition food labels are becoming increasingly important to help us choose between products.</p>
<p>In light of recent advances in nutritional science with regards to the link between diet and chronic diseases such as heart disease, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016 published rules on the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods which will facilitate consumers in making informed decisions when it comes to food choice. By January 1<sup>st</sup> this year, manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual sales must have switched to the new label. Those with less than $10 million in annual sales have until January 1<sup>st</sup> 2021 to comply.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11581" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/NutritionLabel-1-257x300.jpg" width="257" />With the new <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/133699/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nutrition labeling rules</a> kicking in this year, consumers will be seeing labels which reflect how Americans actually eat. One of the requirements listed in these rules states that the first column of the label must list nutrition information based on the serving size for the product and the second column based on the entire contents of the package.</p>
<p><strong>Do nutrition labels influence healthier food choices?</strong></p>
<p>There is little information on how food labels are used in real-life shopping situations, or how they affect dietary choices and patterns. It is important for consumers to understand what nutrition claims mean so that informed decisions on product choice can be made, supporting the argument that smarter labels and smarter policies are needed to make healthy eating the cheaper and more widely available choice.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7622-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">systematic review</a> recently published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> examined the evidence that nutrition claims relating to fat, sugar, and energy content influence energy intake and food choices. The study’s results suggest that these claims can shape the knowledge of consumers with respect to perceived healthfulness of products, as well as the expected and experienced tastiness of food products. Furthermore, nutrition claims can also make the appropriate portion size appear to be larger and lead to an underestimation of the energy content of food products.</p>
<p><strong>Front-of-package nutrition labeling</strong></p>
<p>With the increased public interest in identifying healthier foods, U.S. food processors have been adding nutritional <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11582 alignleft" height="163" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Nutriscore-300x163.png" width="300" />information to the front of packages (FoP) in addition to nutrient content or health claims, a type of labeling also seen in other countries. Examples include symbols that broadly suggest that a food is “healthy,” “good for you,” or “a better choice.” and symbols that purport to list on the front of the packages the key nutrients in that food.</p>
<p>Chile was the first country worldwide to implement a FoP warning label and several countries have followed this model. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7118-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> describing the process of development for the Chilean FoP warning label looks at the visualization, understanding, and ability to modify intended purchase of different prototypes of warning labels. A black-&amp;-white stop sign with a simple text indicating ‘Excess of &lt;nutrient&gt;’ was identified as the best option to implement a warning message in the context of the Chilean Food Labeling and Marketing Law. In June 2016, the Chilean government implemented this FoP warning label (amending it to ‘High in &lt;nutrient&gt;’) and several countries such as Uruguay, Peru, and Israel have approved the implementation of warning labels similar to this one.</p>

<p>Research suggests that consumers like FOP labeling, finding it to be a time-saver. In a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-8108-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Public Health</a>, </em>Jorge Vargas-Meza and colleagues compared the acceptability and understanding of labels used in Latin-America among low- and middle-income Mexican adults. The participants were assigned to one of three labels: Mexican Guideline Daily Allowances (GDA), Ecuador’s Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), or Chile’s Warning Labels (WL) in red.  The time participants took to choose the product was measured, as well as the differences in label acceptability and understanding. The GDA, which indicates the grams and percentages (according to the guideline-based daily intakes) per portion of kilocalories, saturated fats, other fats, sugars, and sodium, had the lowest acceptability and understanding among the labels tested. The MTL and the WL were more accepted and understood, and allowed low- and middle-income consumers to make nutrition-quality related decisions more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Can food labels affect health behavior?</strong></p>
<p>Calorie-only food labels at points of food purchase have had limited success in motivating people to change eating behaviors and increase physical activity. Christopher B. Deery and colleagues set out to examine changes in physical activity in participants exposed to activity-based food labels compared to those seeing standard calorie-only labels in their worksite cafeteria. The results of the <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7960-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> suggest small positive effects for the Physical Activity Calorie Expenditure (PACE) labels on self-reported (~ 20% increase) and objective (~ 6% increase) physical activity. While the overall effects are modest, the results support the need for additional study on factors that may interact with intervention effects. The study also highlights the possibility that women and men respond differently to food labels.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11585" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/foodchoice-277x300.jpg" width="277" />A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6496-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilot randomized controlled trial</a> carried out in Singapore used an experimental web-based grocery store to test two FoP warning labels intended to reduce purchases of products high in sugar. The first label is an English language version similar to the one used in Chile, that shows a black stop sign with the words ‘<em>high-in-sugar’</em> in the center. The second label is a text-based health warning label which is similar to labels considered in several municipalities in the US and also resembles the warning label on cigarettes, but without the accompanying graphics. The text-based health warning label generated a statistically significant reduction in labelled products purchased, suggesting that FoP warning labels have the potential to reduce demand for products high in sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, nutrition claims labels may also be used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy.</p>
<p>The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on the processing of nutrients and fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable. It should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11586" height="189" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/juice-300x189.jpg" width="300" />Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts on healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.</p>
<p>With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5528-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labeled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.</p>
<p>The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Increased regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.</p>
<p><strong>Eating out</strong></p>
<p>As eating out has now become very common, and food served outside of the home is often of low nutritional quality, the FDA also oversees food labeling in restaurant menus.</p>
<p>Although kilocalorie (kcal) labeling of food and drink products sold in restaurant chains in the US is now mandatory, in store kcal labeling practices among major UK restaurant and takeaway chains have not been examined. In August 2018, researchers based at the University of Liverpool contacted, visited the website and/or retail outlets of major eating out and takeaway food chains in the UK, including full-service and fast-food restaurants, cafes and coffee shops. They examined the proportion of chains providing kcal information to customers at point of choice in store and the extent to which kcal information provision adhered to labeling recommendations. They <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7017-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that it is rare for eating out and takeaway chains in the UK to provide point of choice kcal labeling and when labeling is provided it does not adhere to recommended labeling practices.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11587 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/menu-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Calorie information alone may not be sufficient to motivate behavior change, especially when making a decision at the point of purchase (such as in a fast food or cafeteria line) where distractions and time-pressures are common. Physical activity equivalents provided with calorie information may provide increased motivation for healthier food choice as previous research suggests that calorie information alone may not be sufficient for behavior change. Anthony J. Viera et. al. explored this idea in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6433-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> examining the effect of PACE food labels compared to calorie-only labels on point-of-decision food purchasing in three worksite cafeterias in North Carolina. They found that cafeteria patrons exposed to PACE labels during their workday lunch did not purchase any fewer calories than those exposed to calorie-only labels. Future studies in alternative settings, especially fast food restaurants, are called for in order to determine whether physical activity equivalents are a useful addition to existing calorie information in order to provide the extra motivation required to make a healthier food choice.</p>

<p>Is it really believable that Hillary Clinton operated a child sex ring out of a pizza shop — or that Donald Trump was prepared to deport his wife, Melania, after a fight at the White House? Though both these headlines seem obviously false, they were shared millions of times on social media.</p>
<p>The sharing of misinformation — including such blatantly false “fake news” — is of course a serious problem. According to a popular interpretation of why it happens, when deciding what to share, social media users don’t care if a “news” item is true or not, so long as it furthers their own agenda: that is, we are in a “post-truth” era. One recent study suggested, for example, that knowing something is false <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/12/the-more-we-see-fake-news-the-more-likely-we-are-to-share-it/">has little impact on the likelihood of sharing</a>. However, a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/3n9u8">new paper</a> by a team of researchers from MIT and the University of Regina in Canada further challenges that bleak view.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The studies reported in the paper, available as a preprint on <em>PsyArXiv</em>, suggest that in fact, social media users <i>do </i>care whether an item is accurate or not — they just get distracted by other motives (such as wanting to secure new followers or likes) when deciding what to share. As part of their study, the researchers also showed that a simple intervention that targeted a group of oblivious Twitter users increased the quality of the news that they shared. “Our results translate directly into a scalable anti-misinformation intervention that is easily implementable by social media platforms,” they write.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-38917"></span></p>
<p>For the first study, Gordon Pennycook and colleagues presented more than 1,000 online participants with the headlines, initial sentences and accompanying images of 36 actual news stories taken from social media. (They didn’t use full stories as research shows that people often share news stories without clicking through to the full text.) Half of these stories were true and half were false. Also, half were favourable to Republicans and half to Democrats. Some participants were asked to judge whether each headline was accurate. The others were asked if they’d consider sharing the story online.</p>
<p>The headlines of genuine stories received much higher accuracy ratings than the false headlines, and participants were only slightly more likely to rate headlines that supported their own political ideology as being accurate than those that conflicted with it. However, they were also only slightly more likely to consider sharing true rather than false headlines, and much more likely to consider sharing headlines that agreed with their political opinions.</p>
<p>For example, only 15.7 % of Republicans rated the headline: “Over 500 ‘Migrant Caraveners’ Arrested with Suicide Vests” as being accurate, but 51.1% said they would consider sharing it. “Together these results indicate that our participants can effectively identify the accuracy of true versus false headlines when asked to do so — but they are nonetheless willing to share many false headlines that align with their partisanship,” the researches write.</p>
<p>So far, the results were potentially consistent with the post-truth interpretation. However, a questionnaire administered at the end of this study revealed that most people thought it was “extremely important” to share only accurate news. (Only 7.9% said it was “not at all important”.)</p>
<p>Further studies on a total of more than 2,700 online participants revealed that prompting them to simply think about whether a particular headline was accurate or not made them less likely to consider sharing false headlines (and this effect was even stronger for headlines that were congruent with their own political leanings).</p>
<p>For the final study, the researchers identified 5,482 Twitter users who had previously shared links to websites that professional fact-checkers have rated as being highly untrustworthy. These users were sent a message, asking their opinion on the accuracy of a non-political headline, lead paragraph and image. The team then analysed which news stories these people shared over the following 24 hours.</p>
<p>They found small but significant effects, with increases in the quality of the news sources that the users subsequently shared, compared with before the message intervention. The researchers noted an increase in the proportion of high quality stories (from the <em>New York Times</em>, for example) and a decrease in posts from relatively untrustworthy, politically hyper-partisan sources. “In sum, our accuracy message successfully induced Twitter users who regularly shared misinformation to increase the quality of the news they shared,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest firstly that just because someone shares a piece of fake news on social media, it doesn’t mean that they necessarily believe it or endorse it. Also, importantly, “our results suggest that many people mistakenly choose to share misinformation because they were merely distracted from considering the content’s accuracy.” Future work should explore which motives (such as gaining followers, for example) are most relevant to this, they add.</p>
<p>The work also suggests that simple interventions could help to improve the quality of items that are shared. In the future, social media platforms might intermittently ask users to rate the accuracy of randomly-selected headlines, which could bring accuracy to the forefront of users’ minds, they suggest. “Approaches such as the one we propose could potentially increase the quality of news circulating online without relying on a centralised institution to certify truth and censor falsehood,” they conclude.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that actor again? The one who was on that show? Oh, it’s right on the tip of my tongue..!”</p>
<p>That “tip-of-the-tongue” state — where we feel that we’re <em>just</em> on the verge of recalling a word or name — is probably familiar to us all. And it’s been the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/28/why-words-get-stuck-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue-and-how-to-stop-it-recurring/">subject of much research</a> by psycholinguists, who think it happens when we’re able to retrieve a concept or meaning, but not translate that into the letters and sounds of a word.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13421-019-00993-7">new study in <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em></a> has found that when people experience tip-of-the-tongue states, they also become more likely to take risks — suggesting that the phenomenon can exert a surprising influence on completely unrelated behaviour.</p>
<p><span id="more-38902"></span></p>
<p>Researchers already knew that tip-of-the-tongue states were associated with a “positivity bias”. When people are unable to recall a word or name, but feel like they are on the verge of getting it, they are more likely to believe that that word is positive, for instance, or that the name belongs to an ethical person.</p>
<p>This might seem paradoxical, given that the phenomenon is often accompanied by a sense of frustration — but researchers have suggested that there is also a positive element to the experience. Compared to a complete inability to recall a word, having it on the tip of your tongue might give a sense of excitement, or an encouraging feeling that you have relevant knowledge, even if you can’t quite bring it to mind. So, the logic goes, people may mistakenly infer from these feelings that the word itself has positive qualities.</p>
<p>But does this bias also influence other decisions that are unrelated to the word? To investigate this possibility, Anne Cleary and colleagues at Colorado State University conducted a series of studies on how the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon related to people’s risk-taking decisions: specifically, whether or not they chose to gamble.</p>
<p>First, the team asked 19 students to answer 80 general knowledge questions, such as “What is the name of Dorothy’s dog in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>?”. If they couldn’t answer, the participants indicated whether they were experiencing a tip-of-the-tongue state. Then after each question, they rated on a scale of 0 to 10 whether they felt inclined to gamble on the result of a coin-toss.</p>
<p>On average, participants failed to answer around 44 of the questions; of these, they experienced the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon for about 8 (if you are experiencing it right now, let me help — the answer is Toto). And when they experienced the phenomenon, they rated their willingness to gamble as significantly higher than when they had no inkling of the answer.</p>
<p>The authors replicated this finding in a second study of 180 participants, in which some people had a 10-second delay between indicating whether they had experienced the phenomenon and rating their willingness to gamble. These participants also showed a greater inclination to gamble after tip-of-the-tongue states, but the effect wasn’t as strong compared to those without the delay, suggesting that the bias was wearing off.</p>
<p>Finally, the team again repeated the study, this time asking participants to make an actual, rather than hypothetical, decision to gamble on a coin toss. The participants started with 100 points, winning 10 more after correctly guessing the outcome of the toss, and losing 10 when they were wrong. Again, participants were more willing to gamble after tip-of-the-tongue states compared to other instances where they couldn’t answer the question.</p>
<p>The study shows that fleeting positive feelings associated with tip-of-the-tongue states can spill over to affect other decisions. Interestingly, participants showed an <em>even greater</em> inclination to gamble when they were able to actually give answers to the questions. This suggests that tip-of-the-tongue experiences are best seen as “a partial form of retrieval success”, say the authors, “experienced as more positive than no success at all, but less positive than full-blown retrieval success.”</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether the results hold when looking at behaviour with real risks and benefits. The final experiment was meant to provide some real-world validity to the study, but still relied on participants betting on abstract points rather than actually gambling for money. It would also be interesting to know whether the “afterglow” from tip-of-the-tongue states influences other kinds of decisions beyond risk-taking. Still, it seems clear that transient positive-seeming experiences can affect our behaviour in ways that we might not realise.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/615834256/0/oupblogpsychology/">The problem of consciousness</a></h4>

<p>Many people find consciousness deeply puzzling. It is often described as one of the few remaining problems for science to address that is genuinely deep—perhaps even unsolvable.</p><p>Indeed, consciousness is thought to present a challenge to the prevailing scientific image of the universe as physical through-and-through. In part this puzzlement arises because people are (at least tacitly, on an unconscious level) innate dualists—they consider there to be a division between the mental and physical, the mind and body—resulting from a deep disconnect between the core principles of our intuitive, common-sense, or so-called “folk” psychology and the structure of our intuitive (pre-scientific) physics.</p><p>This is why people the world over have always been open to belief in ghosts and spirits, as well as the possibility of an afterlife. It is hard for them to see how the mind could be comprised of arrangements and interactions of physical matter. But this problem—the problem of how mental states in general can be physical—has arguably been solved by cognitive science through some combination of functionalism and the representational theory of mind. That is, the mind is comprised of physical states that perform distinctive functional roles—such as motivating actions in the case of desires, or guiding them in the case of beliefs—while carrying information about (and representing) objects and properties in the world outside of the thinker.</p><p>Even cognitive scientists continue to find <em>consciousness</em> mysterious, however. But this is not the consciousness of being awake versus asleep, nor the sort of consciousness involved in being conscious of (that is, perceiving) some event in one’s environment. Neither of these is mysterious from the standpoint of cognitive science. What is thought to be puzzling is so-called <em>phenomenal </em>consciousness—the introspectively accessible felt properties of our experiences. The nature of this puzzlement is best captured through—and arguably depends on—philosophers’ thought experiments. (My view is that cognitive scientists wouldn’t take these thought experiments seriously were it not for their own tacit dualism about the mind; and non-scientists find the consciousness-debate so fascinating because it confirms their tacit dualism about the mind.) For it seems that I can imagine a creature for whom perceiving the greenness of grass feels introspectively to it in just the same way that seeing the redness of a rose feels to me. Indeed, it seems that I can imagine a creature exactly like myself in all respects (physical, functional, and representational) except that it lacks <em>this</em> (the way my current experience of red feels to me). Many think, in consequence, that phenomenal consciousness involves special properties—often called “qualia”—that aren’t explicable in physical terms.</p><p>In fact, however, there are no special properties. There are no qualia. The temptation to think otherwise derives from the special way in which we can think introspectively about our own perceptual states, deploying concepts such as <em>this</em> (feel of my experience of red). The “problem” of consciousness merely arises out of the contrast between first- and third-person modes of thinking about our own states. For it is one-and-the-same state, with one-and-the-same set of physical and functional properties, that can be thought of now as <em>a perception of red</em> and now as <em>this feel</em>. The latter is just a different way of thinking of the very same state as the former.</p><p>Given that there is no extra property that enters the world with phenomenal consciousness, it follows that the question of consciousness in non-human animals is of no scientific importance. There are many important questions that arise when comparing the minds of ourselves and other animals. We can ask about capacities for long-term planning in animals, for example, and we can ask to what extent their working-memory capacities resemble our own. But the question of qualia isn’t among those questions. For there are no qualia. There are just perceptual states that are available to be thought about (in humans) using a distinctive set of first-person concepts like <em>this feel</em>.</p><p>Some will say that although the question of animal consciousness might not matter for science, it surely matters for ethics. And indeed, as the continuities between human and animal minds have been increasingly recognized, so people have come to feel that it is urgent to identify the set of creatures that are capable of consciousness. This may be because consciousness is a prerequisite for <em>empathy</em>. One can’t enter imaginatively into the experience of another creature unless those experiences, like one’s own, are <em>like something</em> to undergo, it is thought. But empathy arguably is not, and shouldn’t be, foundational to ethical thinking. And the emotion of <em>sympathy</em>, in contrast, can be grounded in a third-person understanding of the desires and sufferings of the creature in question. Perhaps this may be all that is necessary for questions about the ethical treatment of animals to arise.</p><p>Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@anthonyintraversato?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Anthony Intraversato</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/01/the-problem-of-consciousness/">The problem of consciousness</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/615834256/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/615834256/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/615834256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/using-math-to-understand-inequity/" rel="nofollow">Using math to understand inequity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/" rel="nofollow">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-old-music-conservatories-turned-orphans-into-composers/" rel="nofollow">How old music conservatories turned orphans into composers</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bI3Fsti43lk/">Breaking down publication to share the full story of your research</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/01/OS-blog_January-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are traditional research articles still meeting researchers’ communication needs? Over the past decade, Open Science and the rise in digital publications together have facilitated a more agile ecosystem of research-sharing. For researchers, that means: faster pathways to sharing their discoveries; greater transparency of assessment which helps increase reliability and public trust; and more opportunities for collaborations that accelerate advancements in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With increased options for sharing and evaluating science, we’re looking at ways to segment the research-sharing lifecycle to fit the research process. How do we share important, urgent discoveries earlier, without compromising quality? What other essential products of research can we be more transparent about?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Sharing the full story of your research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of publishing might be incremental. Discovery occurs in stages, and the way we share and evaluate research should reflect that. Like <a href="https://plos.org/preregistration">preregistration</a>, a series of linked publications could help show the progression of research from the earliest stages of discovery to its final outcomes. More options for linked publications could also offer a format for presenting additional findings that may be tangential to the main study but spark important new lines of inquiry, allowing for more immediate, accurate, and complete scientific communication overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical research timeline could take years to develop a research plan, gather findings, analyze the data, and seek a suitable journal for publication. When it comes to pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, that seems like too long to wait. A segmented approach to research sharing would make information available faster. </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, give authors more control over when their work becomes public. Posting an early version of their work creates an opportunity for community assessment which sparks new collaborations and can ultimately help strengthen the work for publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more complete and diverse array of outputs to choose from would enable a more dynamic system of credit where researchers receive recognition for their participation in each stage of the process. Options for publishing data, code, protocols, and other products of scientific inquiry as distinct units could also provide incentives for researchers to share more of their work by offering proper credit.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining assessment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New outputs pave the way for a redefinition of assessment. Just as they provide a more honest rendering of the research process, assessment criteria can be tailored to each output, ultimately leading to a more robust system of evaluation that is more aligned with the aims of research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about preregistration </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/preregistration-can-bring-science-back-to-its-roots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier in this series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it’s worth mentioning again here how this model ties publication and assessment more closely to the process of scientific research. Preregistration allows for staged assessment that ultimately improves the investigation by making the study design more robust from the very beginning. It also sets different expectations for the final research outcomes, focusing peer review first on a strong methodological study design and later on adherence to the study protocol so that authors receive an outcome-neutral assessment that emphasizes scientific integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorter forms of publication might could prompt further investigation by sharing early findings and ongoing progress. Update articles offer authors the opportunity to continue a line of inquiry and report back any new findings which might change the way the initial study is perceived, or open avenues for a new line of inquiry, demonstrating more concretely that scientific discovery is not finite, but an ongoing progression of knowledge.</span></p>

A conservative think tank organises a research integrity conference to prove climate change is not real. It is a white men-only academic event, and there are good reasons for that.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/Decisions-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>When it’s time for young adults to make that jump from pediatric to adult nephrologists, it can be daunting and nerve-racking.  Will it be the same?  Who is this new person?  Will they know my medical history?  Will we have to go through the same treatment strategies again?  What is everyone’s role?  Am I ready to take on my health care responsibility?  All of these questions are running through the mind of the patient and the parent.  As an adult nephrologist, my clinical workflow can be quite different from a pediatric nephrologist.  It can often be a daunting task for me when it comes to taking over the care of a pediatric patient who is making the adult service leap.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1665-7">study</a> by Joslin <em>et al., </em>published this week in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a>, discussed the focus that is placed on the clinical outcomes when evaluating these transition clinics, but what about psychosocial outcomes? The study evaluated young adult patient perspectives of their transition program using Likert questionnaires and interviews to address the readiness to transition, the transition process, and the perception of adult care.  The average age of transition was 20 years old and the majority were ready to transfer to the adult health care environment, often insisting they were ready earlier than their transition was planned.</p>
<blockquote><p>adolescents with renal disease are seen as a particularly vulnerable group</p></blockquote>
<p>However, adolescents with renal disease are seen as a particularly vulnerable group. There might be variability in maturity, cognitive delays, establishing their identity and feelings, body image development, personal values, and developing their adult roles. This adds to the list of service transition challenges for both young adults and nephrologists.</p>
<h3><strong>What are some of the other key challenges young adults and nephrologists face with transitions?</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Timing of transition</strong></h4>
<p>When should young adults make that leap to adult health care?  It may need to be individualized.  Every young adult is different.  The discussion should start during checkups or routine office visits between 12-14 years old. Ideally, young adults will start to transition to adult health care between the ages of 18 and 21 years.</p>

<h4><strong>Difficulty navigating adult health care system</strong></h4>
<p>Many differences between pediatric and adult nephrology clinics have been <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00467-004-1763-y.pdf">previously outlined</a>. In pediatric nephrology clinics, the visits are family-oriented and multidisciplinary teams/support is readily available. In contrast, adult nephrology clinics are typically focused on the individual, with limited multidisciplinary support and knowledge of rare ‘pediatric’ diseases. Young adults making the transition to adult health care environments have often been followed by their pediatric nephrologist since birth or childhood so they usually have an understanding of everyone’s roles in the pediatric nephrology clinic. But, once they make the transition to the adult environment a common complaint is knowing what the role of everyone is in this new health care system including their own role.</p>

<h4><strong>Parent-child relationships</strong></h4>
<p>Parents are key players in the health care of their children and valued as integral members of the health care team.  Once a young adult transitions to the adult health care system, parental involvement is transitioned to the sidelines. Are young adults (and parents) ready for that? Young adults might dismiss their ability to handle their health care needs and they do not have the experience to deal with managing treatment decisions, consenting to treatments, comprehending instructions, etc. The experiences of young adults and parents have <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/gfl770.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAm0wggJpBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJaMIICVgIBADCCAk8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMEYTj3XpFM1f3U2z7AgEQgIICIA9zTHpYXs3YRC_BwUZE76fLiRQ_vYzPLCXB9anXw9dN4XiW8-kzmuuFhvxx-DgQVXWLj-538YKa1RhlAWuWu-iKzRcY2muOuq8gYhHKwyNdJuNMKxo40jz8uLP0GUQa6zev17h-KTTafBZ4VyRnydcgMlPUyzNYZM6Cr_c-T-N5IvYtIZy__F0RUm673W7Kqcvi0oYb-GhQuuncH08nyHE2gjfoLMpqp-zs_CUnIlU-ItD-E_TR-6hjHx2ZLc7hG-KWK9p2YyosPGqSumjs0qM7VZmsW3-eMpNj-qqjBVyF0zPYNsUciVad2Y7HgMDA1I9FvK3Y_ORsG9vyo-Cft7JqZLAWFoT-_2QEJPipWjLop1kHaV7eq7Ya85zBoM0vjYgLYtJox_2qUsWVYLNoJ6TmmlC6R6nKSn3ourz40f_0mwkTqTDyOpgYB1ipgcX5UF2gqTVY1SZkeu2XX5IjKD7kWkeHJxXEPl6gIrZicmb5Yl6kFwNNrjpsmeu-R902w6rQeMT5bqa2no_zqsJyJ8RuNb3u7-pWQee9CDU87Gwr5FwUb52I2wj0abQoxzE8W20XI5onRVaKAgzYtMUDQ9stIz4Kx7igwBeugnRLOrNUjYex4gbdinBo6IPevLd-C2JR--bvZ5RPao0vk-kd8Lex3zEeKHeFt2HdN49ub5XPQV-g5oBRZLYdgbRcXBp27JwHFTusVMWo7HaBEBwod78">previously been described</a> in the literature.</p>

<h3><strong>What are the strategies young adult patients and nephrologist can implement to mentally prepare for the healthcare transition?</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theisn.org/">International Society of Nephrology</a> and the <a href="https://ipna-online.org/">International Pediatric Nephrology Association</a> provide a <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00467-011-1981-z.pdf">consensus statement</a> outlining the ideal clinical management of young adult patients transitioning from pediatric to adult renal services.  By implementing a transition program, you can create a more fluid process for transitioning young adults.  A few key recommendations from the consensus statement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning a young adult patient should be individualized and agreed upon by the patient and the parents in conjunction with the pediatric and adult health care teams.</li>
<li>A transition champion in the pediatric and adult health care units should be identified to help coordinate and educate on the transition.</li>
<li>The young adult should be able to receive tools to aid in developing self-management skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot can be gained from studies aiming to understand how best to transition young adults from pediatric to adult services. What’s clear from the work of Joslin <em>et al. </em>is that we should also focus our evaluation of these transition clinics not only on the clinical outcomes but the psychosocial outcomes of the young adults making the adult service leap.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/image-3-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>If you and your community were impacted by a serious health condition, would you want to have a say in local and national research priorities?</p>
<p>“Nothing About Us Without Us!” is a slogan that has become a rallying cry for community partnership in all public services and policy setting. For our team at <a href="https://pretermbirthca.ucsf.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UCSF California Preterm Birth Initiative</a> (PTBi-CA), the saying could easily describe what we consider to be the best approach to research for improving birth outcomes in the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>The preterm birth epidemic</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11572" height="113" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/PTBi-Logo-Full-Dark-grey-Orange-01-300x113.png" width="300" /></strong></p>
<p>Preterm birth has persisted at epidemic levels in our country for decades and disproportionately affects women of color. Black women give birth preterm at almost a <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/MOD2019_REPORT_CARD_and_POLICY_ACTIONS_BOOKLETv72.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50 percent higher rate</a> than all other women in the U.S., regardless of both education and socioeconomic levels. At PTBi-CA, we see mounting evidence that stress, related to structural and interpersonal racism, and other social determinants of health are major drivers of poor birth outcomes in Black families.</p>
<p>However, women of color have not been included in setting preterm birth research agendas. Studies continue to use traditional approaches that give privilege to small groups with decision-making power, without direct input from those with lived experience. Furthermore, research is one of the last domains of the healthcare enterprise that lacks patient and public involvement at every level.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is growing international consensus that research must be conducted in partnership <em>with</em> patients and communities, and not <em>on</em> or <em>for</em> them. This approach can improve recruitment and retention, provides greater relevance and credibility, and accelerates translation of results into clinical practice. Our current work to elicit and prioritize potential research questions and topics with women of color is a step towards full research partnership.</p>
<h3><strong>Dismantling the hierarchy and fighting historical abuses</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>To establish trust, we invested in the community’s existing infrastructure and capacity-building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Typical methods of involving patients and the public in research include gathering input from patient advocacy organizations, inviting patients or their representatives to stakeholder consultation meetings, or conducting surveys. However, these approaches typically begin with a review of existing scientific literature to identify gaps in knowledge. This may inadvertently lead to traditional medical-establishment priorities overshadowing those of people directly affected by the condition.</p>
<p>To develop a new pregnancy and newborn care research strategy, we at PTBi-CA sought a deeper, more authentic partnership approach by using the <a href="https://pretermbirthca.ucsf.edu/news/new-protocol-research-priority-setting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research Priorities of Affected Communities (RPAC) protocol.</a> The protocol is based on the Research Justice Framework, where experiential knowledge as well as cultural and spiritual knowledge have equal value with “mainstream” knowledge.</p>
<p>Before we could begin the work, we partnered with seven community-based organizations (CBOs) that serve pregnant persons of color in areas that have high preterm birth rates. Establishing trust with our CBO partners was a priority and proved challenging due to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/25/556673640/scientists-work-to-overcome-legacy-of-tuskegee-study-henrietta-lacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historical abuses</a> of Black and other minority communities in medical research. To establish trust, we invested in the community’s existing infrastructure and capacity-building. For example, we compensated CBO partners for hosting focus groups, for co-facilitating and for personally inviting clients who met the inclusion criteria. We offered participants opportunities for further engagement with future research and held community events to educate and raise awareness.</p>
<p>The application of the Research Justice framework and the RPAC method led to great results, reported in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2664-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>. Fifty-four women generated a total of 375 potentially researchable questions, clustered within 22 topics. The questions represent a wide range of domains, from basic science, translational, clinical, health and social care delivery to policy and economic research. The findings directly contributed to our initiative’s research strategy and our partnership with community would not stop there.</p>
<h3><strong>Community evolves the research funding process</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“I’m feeling really good at the fact that we are involved, hopefully, in the next generation of healthy babies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We invited our study participants, and those from other community partnerships, to join a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to continually advise us. Each year, CAB members are invited to participate in the grant review process to fund projects that are in line with the community research prioritization questions. In addition to participating in grant-review and funding decisions, the CAB helped to revise the grant application process to include plain English summaries and to greater emphasize community partnership and research dissemination.</p>
<p>The CAB regularly interacts with investigators to increase community partnership literacy among researchers and research literacy among community members. Some of our grantees have gone on to include community partnership in other studies not funded by PTBi-CA. Also, several of the CAB members or community research partners have since transitioned to employment within our organization in a variety of research roles.</p>
<p>None of this progress would be possible without our community partners’ willingness, support and expertise. Our hope is that more research organizations will adopt a research justice framework in their work to help heal the wounds created by past research abuses and to accelerate a fully community-partnered research agenda, leading to positive change and better outcomes for all. As Davina Countee, a community member and study participant, commented about our approach: “I’m feeling really good at the fact that we are involved, hopefully, in the next generation of healthy babies.”</p>

<p>This episode is an encore presentation of an interview with neuroscientists Stephen L. Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde. We talk about their international bestseller <a href="https://amzn.to/2sX8Wy8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>"Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Everyday Deceptions."</em></a> Macknik and Martinez-Conde are neuroscientists who study vision, but several years ago they had the innovative idea of collaborating with magicians to explore how their use of both visual and cognitive illusions reveals secrets about how our brains work.</p> <p>This may sound esoteric, but it has practical consequences, especially for making sound decisions in our complex world.</p> <p>I will be back in 2 weeks with a new interview with Stephen Macknik.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2sX8Wy8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Everyday Deceptions</em></a> by Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde</li> <li><a href="https://www.downstate.edu/ophthalmology/faculty/macknik.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stephen Macknik</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.downstate.edu/ophthalmology/faculty/martinez-conde.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Susana Martinez-Conde</a></li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;">Please Visit Our Sponsors:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">BetterHelp at <a href="http://betterhelp.com/ginger">http://betterhelp.com/ginger</a></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=textexpander-Dec-2019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TextExpander at TextExpander.com/podcast</a>  Announcements:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><em><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brain Science</a></em> will be coming out twice a month in 2020 on the second and 4th Friday.</li> <li>Send email to brainsciencepodcast@gmail.com or post voice feedback at <a href="http://speakpipe.com/docartemis">http://speakpipe.com/docartemis</a>.</li> <li>To win an Amazon gift certificate: post a review of <em>Brain Science</em> in iTunes and send me a screenshot.</li> <li>Learn you can support <em>Brain Science</em> at <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/donations">http://brainsciencepodcast.com/donations</a></li> <li>Learn about Dr. Campbell's new coaching efforts at <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/coaching">http://brainsciencepodcast.com/coaching</a></li> <li>Sign up for the <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/newsletter-">free <em>Brain Science</em> Newsletter</a> to get show notes automatically every month.</li> <li>Check out the <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/iphone-apps/">free <em>Brain Science</em> Mobile app</a> for iOS, Android, and Windows.</li> </ul> <p>Connect on Social Media:</p> <ul> <li>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/docartemis">@docartemis</a></li> <li>Facebook page: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/brainsciencepodcast">http://www.facebook.com/brainsciencepodcast</a></li> </ul> <p>Contact Dr. Campbell:</p> <ul> <li>Email: brainsciencepodcast@gmail.com</li> <li>Voicemail: http://speakpipe.com/docartemis</li> </ul>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/cover-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Expectant parents do not anticipate birth and death to collide. However, for <a href="https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/maternal_perinatal/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of families</a> worldwide each year, the death of their baby due to miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death within the first 28 days of life, is a devastating reality.</p>
<p>Historically, parents’ grief over these losses remained <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/OM.63.2.e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unacknowledged</a>. Over the past few decades, research into the emotional burden of grief has resulted in the development of <a href="https://www.stillbirthcre.org.au/assets/Uploads/Section-3-Full-bereavement-care-guideline2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sensitive healthcare</a> and <a href="http://www.stillbirthfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stillbirth-systematic-review-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">psychosocial support</a> for families. However, bereaved parents continue to report <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519218317220?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stigma </a>and societal norms which can minimize their loss.</p>
<h3><strong>Men and baby loss</strong></h3>
<p>Men are <a href="https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(16)30315-1/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly involved</a> in pregnancy and childbirth. Nevertheless, what we know about men’s grief when a baby dies before or shortly after birth remains somewhat limited. Most previous research and subsequent bereavement care guidelines focus on the experiences of heterosexual women, despite men reporting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2004.00393.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feeling overlooked</a> or ‘<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1440783311413485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forgotten</a>’ as grieving fathers. As one father in <a href="https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(18)30343-7/abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our earlier research</a> described:</p>
<p><em>“Every time I’d get a text from my friends the text was like how’s [female partner]? […] but you know, the father is just as upset even though he doesn’t necessarily show it in the same way”</em> (John, father to stillborn baby)</p>
<p>Therefore, to develop a more-comprehensive understanding of men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss, <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2677-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our recent systematic review</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, summarized existing research on how men experience grief and the factors which contribute to men’s grief.</p>
<h3><strong>‘It’s complicated’</strong></h3>
<p>Our searches identified 46 relevant studies. Grief was highly individual, however, men do seem to face specific challenges which may complicate or delay their grief, and differ from the experiences of women.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need wider strategies and policies that recognise men as grieving fathers.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, there was a general trend towards more problem-focused coping strategies such as ‘keeping busy’ or using distractions including activities or work. Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness were also common, along with responsibilities to care for other children, complete paperwork, organize a funeral/burial, and inform family and friends of the loss. Importantly, a tension also existed between expressing their grief and holding it in or “being strong” to support their female partner and family.</p>
<p>In studies comparing men and women, men generally scored lower on grief measures than women. Importantly, however, the way we currently measure grief may not capture the complexities of men’s grief. Several studies highlighted that commonly used measures may not be sensitive to differences in styles of grief that men may exhibit (e.g., ‘doing’ versus ‘feeling’).</p>
<h3><strong>Four levels</strong></h3>
<p>The factors affecting grief varied across studies. Broadly, we grouped these factors into four different levels: individual, interpersonal, community, and public policy.</p>
<p>At the individual level, factors included men’s personality, their demographic background, and their attachment to the unborn or newborn baby. In general, men who had developed a strong bond with their baby experienced more intense grief.</p>
<p>At the interpersonal level, support and acknowledgement from family, friends, and healthcare professionals were critical in determining how well men could express and navigate their grief. A lack of recognition or support led to feelings of isolation which worsened grief.</p>
<p>At the community level, cultural norms relating to grief and masculinity ideals often led men to feel as though they needed to be the “strong one” or “supporter” to their female partner, rather than a grieving father. This role often took precedence over men’s own needs.</p>
<p>Finally, policies relating to bereavement leave in the workplace, and the woman-centered nature of pregnancy and maternity care, had the potential to contribute to a sense of isolation for men. Three studies identified that a lack of bereavement leave options for men impacted upon how well they were able to work through their grief, and in seven studies, a focus solely on women’s health, especially in the hospital environment, left many men feeling removed and unsupported.</p>
<h3><strong>A broader concept of grief</strong></h3>
<p>Given this range of factors that appear to affect grief, we have proposed a socio-ecological model of men’s grief, which recognizes that grief does not exist in isolation. Rather, it is shaped by a complex system of interacting factors and levels. Without strategies to address factors at each level, we risk increasing men’s isolation and decreasing both perceived and real access to support.</p>

<p>While individual grief counselling and support groups are important, we also need wider strategies and policies that recognise men as grieving fathers. Suggestions include hospital programs that genuinely engage with fathers and promote an equal partnership throughout pregnancy and childbirth; campaigns to raise awareness of the impact of pregnancy/neonatal loss on families, including men; and evaluating current workplace policies for bereavement leave, to afford men equal opportunity to mourn their loss and access appropriate psychosocial supports.</p>
