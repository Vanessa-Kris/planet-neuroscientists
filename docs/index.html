An engineering researcher is up to nine retractions for image issues, having lost eight papers in the last month. Yashvir Singh, of India’s Graphic Era University — ironically enough, given the reasons for the retractions —  is the first author on seven of the papers, and second author on the eighth, which appeared between 2016 … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/04/engineering-professor-up-to-nine-retractions-for-image-problems/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Engineering professor up to nine retractions for image problems</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-children-missed-blood-tests-us-2020-covid-19">Nearly half a million U.S. children missed out on lead tests in early 2020</a></h4>

<p>Close to a half million U.S. children didn’t get tested for lead in the first half of 2020. Nearly 10,000 of those children may have elevated levels of the toxic metal in their blood, researchers estimate.</p>



<p>The study is another troubling indicator of the preventive medical care that children as well as adults in the United States haven’t received since the start of the pandemic. Children haven’t been coming in for pediatric appointments, missing lead testing as well as routine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm?s_cid=mm6919e2_w">vaccinations</a>. Of adults who needed care from March — when widespread shutdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19 began — to mid-July of 2020, 58 percent reported <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775366">forgoing scheduled preventive visits</a>. Screening <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6773.13596">mammogram</a> visits fell after March 2020 compared with previous years.</p>



<p>The health risks to children with elevated lead levels are severe and include <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/1/e20161493">damage to the brain, developmental delays and learning and behavioral problems</a> such as inattention, hyperactivity and aggression.</p>



<p>Researchers poured over data from 34 state and local health departments, assessing blood level testing among children under age 6. From January through May 2020, 480,172 fewer children were tested, a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7005a2.htm?s_cid=mm7005a2_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM48285&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20February%205%2C%202021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM48285">34 percent drop</a>, compared with that time period in 2019, researchers report February 5 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. The number of children tested dropped sharply starting in March, the data show. Overall, those missed tests left an estimated 9,603 children with elevated blood lead levels unidentified.</p>





<p>Those children “continue to be exposed,” says Maitreyi Mazumdar, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who was not involved in the study. There is no safe level of lead. A benchmark level of 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood or greater is a signal to take action. Lead screenings are the starting point to finding children at high risk and removing the source of their lead exposure.</p>



<p>Although blood lead levels have fallen dramatically since the United States began phasing out leaded gasoline in 1973 and banned lead in house paint in 1978, the toxic metal persists in the environment. Children are exposed to lead by paint chips found in homes built prior to 1978, contaminated soil and old lead pipes and fixtures. The number of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leads-damage-can-last-lifetime-or-longer">children with elevated blood lead levels doubled in Flint</a> after a switch in the Michigan city’s water source caused lead to leach from city pipes, which contaminated residents’ tap water (<em>SN: 2/15/16</em>).</p>



<p>Children living in poverty and children of color are more likely to be exposed to lead, Mazumdar says. Even low-level exposures can have long-lasting effects across children’s lives, impacting their “ability to perform well in school and have employment and all of these others things that are important in the long run.”</p>



<p>Testing children for lead as well as staying up to date with vaccines is still necessary, says Mazumdar; mask wearing, handwashing and other prevention measures can lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure during pediatric health visits. Lead testing is not very time-consuming, she says. “It still needs to be done.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-tiny-chameleon-species-may-be-world-smallest-reptile">A new chameleon species may be the world’s tiniest reptile</a></h4>

<p>Hidden beneath the leaf litter of a northern Malagasy forest lives a chameleon so slight that it could tumble off the tip of your finger. Measuring just under 30 millimeters from snout to tail, the newly described species, <em>Brookesia nana, </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80955-1">may be the smallest reptile on Earth</a>, researchers report January 28 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Just two adult specimens, a male and female, are known. The female measures 28.9 millimeters, considerably larger than the 21.6-millimeter-long male. The size difference may have driven the male’s genitalia to be quite large — nearly 20 percent of its body length — to be a better fit to his mate, herpetologist Frank Glaw of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich and colleagues suggest.</p>



<p>Dubbed <em>B. nana</em> for its nano size, the species belongs to a genus of at least 13 other small chameleons spread out across the mountainous forests of northern Madagascar. Why <em>B. nana</em> and its cousins shrank to such minuscule proportions remains a mystery, though smallness does have its benefits: There’s some evidence that small chameleons <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18625">are especially good shots</a> with their ballistic tongues. </p>



<p>In daylight, <em>Brookesia</em> chameleons scour the forest floor, snatching up mites and other small invertebrates, Glaw’s team suspects. At night, the lizards retreat upward, gripping blades of grass or other plants for safety. </p>



<p>Deforestation and habitat degradation threaten <em>B. nana</em>’s future, the researchers say, though the region where the compact chameleons were found was recently designated a protected area by the Malagasy government. The species may soon be listed as critically endangered, the gravest rating made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>We (INCF) have, as of this morning, officially applied to Google as a mentoring organization in 2021. This is our 11th time. We have a <a data-id="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing">Project Ideas list</a> of 55 projects from 27 mentor teams, a new record!</p>



<p>The next step is interacting with prospective students, and waiting for Google’s announcement of this year’s accepted mentor organizations (March 9). Since a few years back, we post all project ideas on our <a href="https://neurostars.org/c/gsoc/5">forum</a> to make it easier  for students and mentors to discuss.</p>

<p>Thick yarn makes for a quick knit. I am already finished with the Gunhild cardigan, a month before the agreed deadline. Slight stumbling block on the way; I ran out of main colour yarn after doing some modifications. And it wasn’t to be had anywhere in Europe, and out of stock at the supplier.</p>



<p>But I had bought some extra contrast color yarn, so I ended up doing half sleeves in the contrast color, and not just the edging. With extra long sleeves, which I like. And I sewed in a button so it would be wearable without a shawl pin for closure.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The idea that people learn better when taught in a way that matches their specific “learning style” — auditory, kinesthetic, visual or some combination of the three — is widely considered a myth. Research has variously suggested that learners <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">don’t actually benefit</a> from their preferred style, that teachers and pupils have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/">different ideas</a> about what learning styles actually work for them, and that we have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/05/it-feels-as-though-we-learn-better-via-our-preferred-learning-style-but-we-dont/">very little insight</a> into how much we’re actually learning from various methods.</p>



<p>Despite this evidence, a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/">large proportion of people</a> — including the general public, educators and even those with a background in neuroscience — still believe in the myth. And a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.602451/full">new review</a>, published in <em>Frontiers in Education</em>, finds no signs of that changing.</p>



<span id="more-41302"></span>



<p>The team looked at articles that focused on belief in learning styles published between 2009 and April 2020. Articles with participant groups that were not made up of educators or trainee educators were excluded from analysis, as were surveys that focused not on whether learning styles actually existed but on other opinions — whether they explain differences in achievement, for example. Data from over 15,000 educators were included in the analysis.</p>



<p>Overall, 89.1% of participants believed that people learn better when instruction is matched to their learning styles. A total of 95.4% of trainee educators believed in learning styles — slightly higher than the 87.8% of qualified educators who showed similar beliefs. And despite more widespread debunking of the myth, both in academic publishing and the mainstream media, there was no significant decrease in belief in studies conducted more recently.</p>



<p>This had a real impact on how teachers worked: in the seven studies that measured use or planned use of learning style-matched teaching, 79.7% of educators said they used or intended to use matched teaching methods. Interventions designed to disavow educators of their belief in learning styles did seem to make some difference, however — in the four studies that utilised training for these purposes, belief decreased significantly, from 78.4% to 37.1%.</p>



<p>The myth of learning styles, it seems, is as pervasive as ever. But <em>why</em> educators continue to believe in them is less clear. It may be that the belief is heavily promoted during teacher training; it could be that teachers are working with their students as their teachers worked with them; or it could be that attempts to debunk the myth have simply not been high profile enough, failing to cut through to educators.</p>



<p>But researchers could also do with improving research into the prevalence of learning style myths, the team suggests. Many studies included in the analysis had no key indicators of the quality of survey responses, raising questions about the generalisability of findings. “None of the studies use a defined, representative sample, and very few include sufficient information to allow the calculation of a response rate,” the team writes. The questionnaires used in the studies could also be clearer about exactly what it means to “match” instruction to learning styles, the authors add.</p>



<p>Future research could also look at the <em>consequences</em> of learning style-matched teaching — does it actually matter if the myth is perpetuated, and does it have a serious impact on how people learn? Studying how training can educate teachers on the learning style myth could also help us understand how it spreads and why it sticks — and might help students get the most out of education at the same time. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/famous-brain-sketches-cajal-come-life-again-embroideries">Famous brain sketches come to life again as embroideries</a></h4>

<p>In the late 1800s, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish brain scientist, spent long hours in his attic drawing elaborate cells. His careful, solitary work helped reveal individual cells of the brain that together create wider networks. For those insights, Cajal received a Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in 1906.</p>



<p>Now, a group of embroiderers has traced those iconic cell images with thread, paying tribute to the pioneering drawings that helped us see the brain clearly.</p>



<p>The Cajal Embroidery Project was launched in March of 2020 by scientists at the University of Edinburgh. Over a hundred volunteers — scientists, artists and embroiderers — sewed panels <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30348-3/fulltext">that will ultimately be stitched into a tapestry</a>, a project described in the December <em>Lancet Neurology</em>.</p>



<p>Catherine Abbott, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, had the idea while talking with her colleague Jane Haley, who was planning an exhibit of Cajal’s drawings. These meticulous drawings re-created nerve cells, or neurons, and other types of brain cells, including support cells called astrocytes. “I said, off the cuff, ‘Wouldn’t it be lovely to embroider some of them?’”</p>



<p>The project had just begun when the COVID-19 pandemic upended the world. But stitching at home amid the shutdowns was a soothing activity, says Katie Askew, a neuroimmunologist at the University of Edinburgh. “Having something that can occupy your hands so you’re not scrolling through your phone looking at the news is great,” she says. Askew chose to re-create a type of neuron known as a Purkinje cell from a human cerebellum, a structure at the back and bottom of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Purkinje cells collect signals with lush thickets of tendrils, before sending along their own quieting signals. Cajal’s particular specimen nearly filled Askew’s fabric panel. “They are amazing cells,” she says. Spending months staring at a single cell has led her to spot similar branches in trees, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="9 embroideries of Cajal drawings" class="wp-image-3095837" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/012621_ls_brain-embroidery_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3095837">To honor the insights of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, embroiderers re-created nine of his iconic drawings, which spanned an array of cell types in the brain.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3095837">Cajal Embroidery Project; top row (left to right): Liz Ribchester, Katie Askew, Janet Philp; middle row: Carol Coleman, Jane Haley, Emma Perkins; bottom row: Niki Stypidou, Melanie Stefan, Alison Todd</span></figure>



<p>Cajal’s artistic eye is obvious in his drawings, says Annie Campbell, one of the volunteers who contributed a square. “His images live in this liminal space between science and fine art,” says Campbell, who is herself an artist at Auburn University in Alabama. “He was making aesthetic decisions about what to leave out so that somebody could look at that and say, ‘Oh, that’s a neuron without all its dendrites so I can see the astrocyte wrapped around it.’”</p>



<p>Campbell decided to embroider an astrocyte with looping tendrils “for the beauty of the shape,” she says. As she sewed, she also began to learn more about the cells, which perform a variety of crucial jobs in the brain, including healing injuries.</p>



<p>Cajal’s drawings are still relevant today, says Abbott. “What strikes me the most is how completely timeless they are.” Even with powerful, high-resolution microscopes, scientists today see cells in a similar way. “It’s almost depressing to think that even with all of this fancy equipment, we’re not all that far ahead,” she says. “But I like that. I like that there is this direct connection to 100 years ago.”</p>



<p>That thread ties the embroiderers today to Cajal’s work, Abbott says. “We are looking at the same thing and feeling the same sense of wonder.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/upwelling-rock-beneath-atlantic-ocean-may-drive-continents-apart">An upwelling of rock beneath the Atlantic may drive continents apart</a></h4>

<p>An upsurge of hot rock from deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean may be driving the continents on either side apart.</p>



<p>The Americas are moving away from Europe and Africa by a few centimeters each year, as the tectonic plates underlying those continents drift apart. Researchers typically think tectonic plates separate as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">the distant edges of those plates sink down into Earth’s mantle</a>, creating a gap (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Material from the upper mantle then seeps up through the rift between the plates to fill in the seafloor.</p>



<p>But new seismic data from the Atlantic Ocean floor show that hot rock is welling up beneath a seafloor rift called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from hundreds of kilometers deep in Earth’s mantle. This suggests that material rising up under the ridge is not just a passive response to tectonic plates sliding apart. Rather, deep rock pushing toward Earth’s surface <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03139-x">may be driving a wedge between the plates that helps separate them</a>, researchers report online January 27 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>A better understanding of plate tectonics — which causes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-americas-largest-recorded-earthquake-helped-confirm-plate-tectonics">earthquakes</a> and volcanic eruptions — could help people better prepare for these natural disasters (<em>SN: 9/3/17</em>).</p>





<p>Matthew Agius, a seismologist at Roma Tre University in Rome, and colleagues glimpsed what’s happening beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge using 39 seismometers on the seafloor near a spot along the ridge between South America and Africa. Those sensors monitored rumbles from earthquakes around the world for about a year. Because the seismic waves from those quakes traveled deep through Earth’s mantle on their way to the seismometers, the recorded tremors contained clues about the location and movement of material far below the seafloor.</p>



<p>In those signals, Agius’ team saw hints of material from Earth’s lower mantle, more than 600 kilometers below the seafloor, welling up toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. “This was completely unexpected,” Agius says, and it could be a powerful force for pushing apart the tectonic plates on either side of the rift.</p>



<p>“It’s certainly an interesting observation,” says Jeroen Ritsema, a seismologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the work. But it’s hard to tell how much deep mantle upwelling contributes to Atlantic seafloor spreading, based on observations from only one group of seismometers near the equator, he says. It’s like “you’re looking through a keyhole, and you’re trying to see what’s in the living room and the bedroom and the kitchen.”</p>



<p>Observations at other locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, as well as other mid-ocean ridges around the world, could help determine whether deep mantle material surging up beneath these rifts really plays a major role in seafloor spreading.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">How a tiny spider uses silk to lift prey 50 times its own weight</a></h4>

<p>A family of spiders can catch prey many times their own weight by hitching silk lines to their quarry and hoisting the meaty prize up into the air.</p>



<p>Tangle web spiders, in the Theridiidae family, are masters of using silk to amplify muscle power. Their webs are “a messy tangle,” says Gabriele Greco, who studies biological materials at the University of Trento in Italy. Silk strands slant and crisscross in a cobwebby scribble.</p>



<p>Filming how spiders hunt from such snarls, Greco and Trento colleague Nicola Pugno focused on the most spectacular scenarios: attacks on insects that weighed up to 50 times as much as the spiders themselves. The web makers, however, could win their battles, thanks to adroit fighting, venom and lots of prey-wrapping silk. Victorious spiders also attached <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0907">multiple silk threads to their prey bundle</a> to haul the feast up to the web, Greco and Pugno report February 3 in <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface.</em> Yet oddly these threads never get pulled totally taut.</p>



<p>To analyze the spiders’ weight-hauling moves, the researchers set up lab boxes with black walls for easy observation of white silk. Inside each box went a Theridiidae species<em>, </em>either a triangulate cobweb spider (<em>Steatoda triangulosa</em>) or a false black widow (<em>S. paykulliana</em>).</p>





<p>In the wild, both species stretch some strands from the tangle down to the ground, anchoring the strand’s sticky end. When some small, edible creature such as an ant bumbles against the strand, it breaks loose from the ground and yanks the tiny morsel upward to flail helplessly in the air. Lunch!</p>



<p>What really interested Greco and Pugno, however, were reports of these strands occasionally catching “giant” prey, including a snake and a mouse. To give the food-catching silk an extreme workout, researchers used big cockroaches.</p>



<p>A single sticky-end strand can’t jerk a heavy roach into the air, so when prey bumps the silk, the resident spider rushes to add extra strands to its big catch. In the lab box tests, spiders had to add strand after strand before researchers saw the first upward lurch. During the whole raising process, the hauling threads still maintained some give instead of being stretched very tight. That makes sense, Greco concluded, because these strands get tugged and jounced a lot by struggling prey. Super tight strands might break.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Filmed in a lab box, a little <em>Steatoda</em> spider tries to capture a much bigger roach to feast on. Spiders didn’t evolve pulleys with wheels for lifting massive loads, but tangle web spiders like these have a silky alternative. The spider attaches one silk strand after another to the struggling roach until the silk supports all of the roach’s weight. Then the spider keeps adding shorter and shorter strands that tug the monster weight of the prey up toward the main part of the web.</figure>



<p>What these spiders have evolved isn’t a loading-dock pulley with a wheel, but attaching a sequence of silk strands gives the tiny animals their own way of lifting heavy burdens in little increments. After some 400 million years of evolution, spiders’ forms and uses of silk fascinate researchers like Greco, who are looking for new materials.</p>



<p>The new study of silk-based weight lifting strikes Symone Alexander, a chemical engineer with wide-ranging interests at Auburn University in Alabama, as “very cool.” The rounded, spoked webs on Halloween décor may be the popular notion of spider silk, but the animals have expanded the places and ways they can live with a wide range of silky innovations. Spiders have evolved silky trap doors, nets, lassos and — one close to Alexander’s heart — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slingshot-spider-web-acceleration">ultrafast slingshots</a> (<em>SN:3/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>“Even in a single web, there are different types of silk (and glue) used to make frame lines, capture lines and anchor lines,” she says. “Spiders are ingenious.”</p>

<p>An unusual mud-wrapped mummy is leading archaeologists to rethink how nonroyal Egyptians preserved their dead.</p>



<p>CT scans of an Egyptian mummy from around 1200 B.C. reveal that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/Users/mariatemming1/Downloads/Ixodes%20scapularis">the body is sheathed in a mud shell</a> between its layers of linen wrappings. Ancient Egyptians may have used this preservation technique, never before seen in Egyptian archaeology, to repair damage to the mummified body and mimic royal burial customs, researchers report February 3 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>While the mummy’s legs are caked with mud about 2.5 centimeters thick, the mud over its face is spread as thin as 1.5 millimeters. Chemical analyses of mud flakes from around the head indicate that the mud layer is covered in a white, possibly limestone-based pigment, topped with a red mineral paint.</p>



<p>Leg fractures and other damage to the mummy’s body hint that the mud wrap may have been used to restore the body after it was desecrated, potentially by tomb robbers. Repairing the body would have ensured that the deceased could continue existing in the afterlife.</p>



<p>The mud shell may also have been a poor man’s version of the expensive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origins-egyptian-mummy-making-may-predate-pyramids">resin coatings</a> seen on royal mummies of this era, the researchers suggest (<em>SN: 8/18/14</em>). “Status in Egyptian society was in large part measured by proximity to the king,” says Karin Sowada, an archaeologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. So imitating royal funerary practices may have been a display of social status.</p>



<p>The identity and social standing of the mud-wrapped individual remains a mystery. Analyzing other nonroyal mummies from ancient Egypt may reveal how common mud shells were, who used them and why.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/03/new-tool-to-visualize-related-articles/">New tool to visualize related articles</a></h4>

<p class="ba b bb bc cd mt cc gl mu gn go bd"><img alt="Connected Papers Logo Image" class="alignright wp-image-878 size-medium" height="117" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Connected-Papers-logo-1-300x117.png" width="300" />A new feature on arXiv.org helps readers explore related academic papers directly from article abstract pages. Developed by <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/">Connected Papers</a> and now released as an <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration, the tool links to interactive visualizations of similar articles. Connected Papers graphs can help readers explore a visual overview of a new academic field, create a bibliography, discover the most relevant prior and derivative works of a paper, and more.</p>
<p>Readers will find the feature below an article abstract in the “Related Papers” tab, as shown below. By activating the Connected Papers toggle switch, readers can follow a link to the article’s graph displayed at Connected Papers. Each paper’s graph is created by analyzing tens of thousands of papers for similarity in their citations, and then a small subset of those analyzed are arranged according to their degree of similarity. Each node in the graph represents an article, which has its own set of connected papers.</p>
<p>“Connected Papers started as a weekend side project between friends, to solve our own problems with literature reviews,” said Eddie Smolyansky, co-founder of Connected Papers. “We can’t believe how quickly the scientific community embraced the tool and we’re so excited to be featured on arXiv – a website that we use daily in our own research. With this kind of support, we plan to keep improving Connected Papers and to build more tools for the academic community.”</p>
<p>arXivLabs is a framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations to bring innovative tools to the arXiv community, and <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">we welcome new proposals</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity unveiled a dynamic and bizarre cosmos</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Albert Einstein’s mind reinvented space and time, foretelling a universe so bizarre and grand that it has challenged the limits of human imagination. An idea born in a Swiss patent office that evolved into a mature theory in Berlin set forth a radical new picture of the cosmos, rooted in a new, deeper understanding of gravity. </p>



<p>Out was Newton’s idea, which had reigned for nearly two centuries, of masses that appeared to tug on one another. Instead, Einstein presented space and time as a unified fabric distorted by mass and energy. Objects warp the fabric of spacetime like a weight resting on a trampoline, and the fabric’s curvature guides their movements. With this insight, gravity was explained.</p>



<p>Einstein presented his general theory of relativity at the end of 1915 in a series of lectures in Berlin. But it wasn’t until a solar eclipse in 1919 that everyone took notice. His theory predicted that a massive object — say, the sun — could distort spacetime nearby enough to bend light from its straight-line course. Distant stars would thus appear not exactly where expected. Photographs taken during the eclipse verified that the position shift matched Einstein’s prediction. “Lights all askew in the heavens; men of science more or less agog,” declared a <em>New York Times</em> headline.</p>



<p>Even a decade later, a story in <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, wrote of “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/riots-understand-einstein-theory">Riots to understand Einstein theory</a>” (<em>SN: 2/1/30, p. 79</em>). Apparently extra police had to be called in to control a crowd of 4,500 who “broke down iron gates and mauled each other” at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to hear an explanation of general relativity.</p>

<p>By 1931, physicist Albert A. Michelson, the first American to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences, called the theory “a revolution in scientific thought unprecedented in the history of science.”</p>



<p>But for all the powers of divination we credit to Einstein today, he was a reluctant soothsayer. We now know that general relativity offered much more than Einstein was willing or able to see. “It was a profoundly different way of looking at the universe,” says astrophysicist David Spergel of the Simons Foundation’s Flatiron Institute in New York City, “and it had some wild implications that Einstein himself didn’t want to accept.” What’s more, says Spergel (a member of the Honorary Board of the Society for Science, publisher of <em>Science News</em>), “the wildest aspects of general relativity have all turned out to be true.”</p>



<p>What had been masquerading as a quiet, static, finite place is instead a dynamic, ever-expanding arena filled with its own riot of space-bending beasts. Galaxies congregate in superclusters on scales vastly greater than anything experts had considered before the 20th century. Within those galaxies reside not only stars and planets, but also a zoo of exotic objects illustrating general relativity’s propensity for weirdness, including neutron stars, which pack a fat star’s worth of mass into the size of a city, and black holes, which pervert spacetime so strongly that no light can escape. And when these behemoths collide, they shake spacetime, blasting out ginormous amounts of energy. Our cosmos is violent, evolving and filled with science fiction–like possibilities that actually come straight out of general relativity.</p>



<p>“General relativity opened up a huge stage of stuff for us to look at and try out and play with,” says astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter of the University of California, Berkeley. He points to the idea that the universe changes dramatically over its lifetime — “the idea of a lifetime of a universe at all is a bizarre concept” — and the idea that the cosmos is expanding, plus the thought that it could collapse and come to an end, and even that there might be other universes. “You get to realize that the world could be much more interesting even than we already ever imagined it could possibly be.”</p>

<h3>An expanding picture</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Einstein’s equations of general relativity were a wellspring from which our current view of the cosmos has flowed. That the theory continues to supply so many rich questions is part of what makes it “just incredible,” says David Spergel, an astrophysicist at the Simons Foundation’s Flatiron Institute in New York City. Over the last century, we’ve detected cosmic beasts that defy the imagination. We’ve also learned some crucial facts about our cosmos: The universe is expanding, and at an accelerating rate. The universe began with a bang 13.8 billion years ago. And mysterious forms of matter and energy are shaping the cosmos in unexpected and largely unknown ways. Read about some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/milestones?themes=3095867">milestones in our expanding picture</a>, including Vera Rubin’s contributions.</p>

<p>General relativity has become the foundation for today’s understanding of the cosmos. But the current picture is far from complete. Plenty of questions remain about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-claim-dama-cosine">mysterious matter</a> and forces, about the beginnings and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-end-everything-explores-ways-universe-could-perish">the end of the universe</a>, about how the science of the big meshes with quantum mechanics, the science of the very small. Some astronomers believe a promising route to answering some of those unknowns is another of general relativity’s initially underappreciated features — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos">the power of bent light to magnify features of the cosmos</a>.</p>



<p>Today’s scientists continue to poke and prod at general relativity to find clues to what they might be missing. General relativity is now being tested to a level of precision previously impossible, says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale ​University. “General relativity expanded our cosmic view, then gave us sharper focus on the cosmos, and then turned the tables on it and said, ‘now we can test it much more strongly.’ ” It’s this testing that will perhaps <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">uncover problems</a> with the theory that might point the way to a fuller picture.</p>



<p>And so, more than a century after general relativity debuted, there’s plenty left to foretell. The universe may turn out to be even wilder yet.</p>



<h4>Ravenous beasts</h4>



<p>Just over a century after Einstein unveiled general relativity, scientists obtained visual confirmation of one of its most impressive beasts. In 2019, a global network of telescopes revealed a mass warping spacetime with such fervor that nothing, not even light, could escape its snare. The Event Horizon Telescope <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">released the first image of a black hole</a>, at the center of galaxy M87 (<em>SN: 4/27/19, p. 6</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="image of black hole in galaxy M87" class="wp-image-3095946" height="580" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline1_680.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3095946">In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released this first-ever image of a black hole, at the heart of galaxy M87. The image shows the shadow of the monster surrounded by a bright disk of gas.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3095946">Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration</span></figure>



<p>“The power of an image is strong,” says Kazunori Akiyama, an astrophysicist at the MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, Mass., who led one of the teams that created the image. “I somewhat expected that we might see something exotic,” Akiyama says. But after looking at the first image, “Oh my God,” he recalls thinking, “it’s just perfectly matching with our expectation of general relativity.”</p>



<p>For a long time, black holes were mere mathematical curiosities. Evidence that they actually reside out in space didn’t start coming in until the second half of the 20th century. It’s a common story in the annals of physics. An oddity in some theorist’s equation points to a previously unknown phenomenon, which kicks off a search for evidence. Once the data are attainable, and if physicists get a little lucky, the search gives way to discovery.</p>



<p>In the case of black holes, German physicist Karl Schwarzschild came up with a solution to Einstein’s equations near a single spherical mass, such as a planet or a star, in 1916, shortly after Einstein proposed general relativity. Schwarzschild’s math revealed how the curvature of spacetime would differ around stars of the same mass but increasingly smaller sizes — in other words, stars that were more and more compact. Out of the math came a limit to how small a mass could be squeezed. Then in the 1930s, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder described what would happen if a massive star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity shrank past that critical size — today known as the “Schwarzschild radius” — reaching a point from which its light could never reach us. Still, Einstein — and most others — doubted that what we now call black holes <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968902?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">were plausible in reality</a>.</p>



<p>The term <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/50-years-later-its-hard-say-who-named-black-holes">“black hole” first appeared in print in <em>Science News Letter</em></a>. It was in a 1964 story by Ann Ewing, who was covering a meeting in Cleveland of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (<em>SN: 1/18/64, p. 39</em>). That’s also about the time that hints in favor of the reality of black holes started coming in.</p>



<p>Just a few months later, Ewing reported the discovery of quasars — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quasars-are-crazy">describing them</a> in <em>Science News Letter</em> as “the most distant, brightest, most violent, heaviest and most puzzling sources of light and radio waves” (<em>SN: 8/15/64, p. 106</em>). Though not linked to black holes at the time, quasars hinted at some cosmic powerhouses needed to provide such energy. The use of X-ray astronomy in the 1960s revealed new features of the cosmos, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/case-black-hole-cygnus-x-1">bright beacons that could come from a black hole scarfing down a companion star</a>. And the motions of stars and gas clouds near the centers of galaxies pointed to something exceedingly dense lurking within.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Quasar illustration" class="wp-image-3095945" height="580" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline2_680.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3095945">Quasars (one illustrated) are so bright that they can outshine their home galaxies. Though baffling when first discovered, these outbursts are powered by massive, feeding black holes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3095945">Mark Garlick/Science Source</span></figure>



<p>Black holes stand out among other cosmic beasts for how extreme they are. The largest are many billion times the mass of the sun, and when they rip a star apart, they can spit out particles with 200 trillion electron volts of energy. That’s some 30 times the energy of the protons that race around the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider.</p>



<p>As evidence built into the 1990s and up to today, scientists realized these great beasts not only exist, but also help shape the cosmos. “These objects that general relativity predicted, that were mathematical curiosities, became real, then they were marginal. Now they’ve become central,” says Natarajan.</p>



<p>We now know supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most if not all galaxies, where they generate outflows of energy that affect how and where stars form. “At the center of the galaxy, they define everything,” she says.</p>



<p>Though visual confirmation is recent, it feels as though black holes have long been familiar. They are a go-to metaphor for any unknowable space, any deep abyss, any endeavor that consumes all our efforts while giving little in return.</p>



<p>Real black holes, of course, have given plenty back: answers about our cosmos plus new questions to ponder, wonder and entertainment for space fanatics, a lost album from Weezer, numerous episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em>, the Hollywood blockbuster <em>Interstellar</em>.</p>



<p>For physicist Nicolas Yunes of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, black holes and other cosmic behemoths continue to amaze. “Just thinking about the dimensions of these objects, how large they are, how heavy they are, how dense they are,” he says, “it’s really breathtaking.”</p>

<h4>Spacetime waves</h4>



<p>When general relativity’s behemoths collide, they disrupt the cosmic fabric. Ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves emanate outward, a calling card of a tumultuous and most energetic tango.</p>



<p>Einstein’s math predicted such waves could be created, not only by gigantic collisions but also by explosions and other accelerating bodies. But for a long time, spotting any kind of spacetime ripple was a dream beyond measure. Only the most dramatic cosmic doings would create signals that were large enough for direct detection. Einstein, who called the waves <em>gravitationswellen</em>, was unaware that any such big events existed in the cosmos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Gravitational waves illustration" class="wp-image-3095942" height="579" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline4_1030.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3095942">Gravitational waves ripple away from two black holes that orbit each other before merging (shown in this simulation). The merging black holes created a new black hole that’s much larger than those found in previous collisions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3095942">Deborah Ferguson, Karan Jani, Deirdre Shoemaker and Pablo Laguna/Georgia Tech, Maya Collaboration</span></figure>



<p>Beginning in the 1950s, when others were still arguing whether gravitational waves existed in reality, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-road-detecting-gravity-waves">physicist Joseph Weber</a> sunk his career into trying to detect them. After a decade-plus effort, he claimed detection in 1969, identifying an apparent signal perhaps from a supernova or from a newly discovered type of rapidly spinning star called a pulsar. In the few years after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gravitational-waves-detected">reporting the initial find</a>, <em>Science News</em> published more than a dozen stories on what it began calling the “Weber problem” (<em>SN: 6/21/69, p. 593</em>). Study after study could not confirm the results. What’s more, no sources of the waves could be found. A 1973 headline read, “The deepening doubt about Weber’s waves” (<em>SN: 5/26/73, p. 338</em>).</p>



<p>Weber stuck by his claim until his death in 2000, but his waves were never verified. Nonetheless, scientists increasingly believed gravitational waves would be found. In 1974, radio astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor spotted a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/going-circles-pulsar">neutron star orbiting a dense companion</a>. Over the following years, the neutron star and its companion appeared to be getting closer together by the distance that would be expected if they were losing energy to gravitational waves. Scientists soon spoke not of the Weber problem, but of what equipment could possibly pick up the waves. “Now, although they have not yet seen, physicists believe,” Dietrick E. Thomsen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/trying-rock-gravitys-vibes">wrote in <em>Science News</em> in 1984</a> (<em>SN: 8/4/84, p. 76</em>).</p>



<p>It was a different detection strategy, decades in the making, that would provide the needed sensitivity. The Advanced Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO, which reported the first confirmed gravitational waves in 2016, relies on two detectors, one in Hanford, Wash., and one in Livingston, La. Each detector splits the beam of a powerful laser in two, with each beam traveling down one of the detector’s two arms. In the absence of gravitational waves, the two beams recombine and cancel each other out. But if gravitational waves stretch one arm of the detector while squeezing the other, the laser light no longer matches up.</p>





<p>The machines are an incredible feat of engineering. Even spacetime ripples detected from colliding black holes might stretch an arm of the LIGO detector by as little as one ten-thousandth of the width of a proton.</p>



<p>When the first detection, from two colliding black holes, was announced, the discovery was heralded as the beginning of a new era in astronomy. It was <em>Science News</em>’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-top-science-stories-2016">story of the year in 2016</a>, and such a big hit that the pioneers of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-explained">LIGO detector</a> won the Nobel Prize in physics the following year.</p>



<p>Scientists with LIGO and another gravitational wave detector, Virgo, based in Italy, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">have by now logged dozens more detections</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 30</em>). Most of the waves have emanated from mergers of black holes, though a few events have featured neutron stars. Smashups so far have revealed the previously unknown <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">birthplaces of some heavy elements</a> and pointed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-neutron-stars-light-speed-space">a bright jet of charged subatomic particles</a> that could offer clues to mysterious flashes of high-energy light known as gamma-ray bursts. The waves also have revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">midsize black holes, between 100 and 100,000 times the sun’s mass, do in fact exist</a> — along with reconfirming that Einstein was right, at least so far.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Virgo facility in Italy" class="wp-image-3095941" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline5_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3095941">Researchers at two gravitational wave observatories, LIGO in the United States and Virgo in Italy (shown), have reported dozens of detections of black hole smashups, as well as neutron star mergers, in the last five years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3095941">The Virgo Collaboration</span></figure>



<p>Just five years in, some scientists are already eager for something even more exotic. In a <em>Science News </em>article about detecting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-circling-wormhole-weird-gravitational-waves">black holes orbiting wormholes</a> via gravitational waves, physicist Vítor Cardoso of Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, suggested a coming shift to more unusual phenomena: “We need to look for strange but exciting signals,” he said (<em>SN: 8/29/20, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>Gravitational wave astronomy is truly only at its beginnings. Improved sensitivity at existing Earth-based detectors will turn up the volume on gravitational waves, allowing detections from less energetic and more distant sources. Future detectors, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/satellite-trio-will-hunt-gravitational-waves-space">the space-based LISA</a>, planned for launch in the 2030s, will get around the troublesome noise that interferes when Earth’s surface shakes.</p>



<p>“Perhaps the most exciting thing would be to observe a small black hole falling into a big black hole, an extreme mass ratio inspiraling,” Yunes says. In such an event, the small black hole would zoom back and forth, back and forth, swirling in different directions as it followed wildly eccentric orbits, perhaps for years. That could offer the ultimate test of Einstein’s equations, revealing whether we truly understand how spacetime is warped in the extreme.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>An increasingly large body of work suggests that many illicit psychoactive drugs could be useful as treatments for certain mental health problems. Studies have found, for instance, that the psychedelics psilocybin (from magic mushrooms) and LSD can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9">reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression</a>, while MDMA may be useful in treating PTSD.  </p>



<p>It’s a different story for a practice known as “microdosing”, however. This involves taking a small quantity of a psychedelic substance — normally too little to produce any perceptible effects — repeatedly over a period of time (every few days for several weeks, say). And <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/14/lack-of-scientific-proof-that-microdosing-psychedelic-drugs-improves-wellbeing-or-creativity/">as we reported in 2019</a>, although results from some surveys or poorly-controlled trials suggest that microdosing can improve people’s mood or certain aspects of cognition, more rigorous placebo-controlled trials have failed to find any such effects.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81446-7">new study in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> could explain why. The team, led by Laura Kartner from Imperial College London, finds that people who plan on microdosing do go on to experience a boost to wellbeing and a reduction in anxiety and depression. But the level of improvement depends on how much they <em>expect</em> to improve in the first place, suggesting that any effects on wellbeing may be the result of a strong placebo response.</p>



<span id="more-41297"></span>



<p>The researchers recruited 253 people who were planning on microdosing a psychedelic drug such as psilocybin, LSD, or ayahuasca. In the week before the participants began microdosing, they completed a survey about their expectations, indicating how confident they were that the experience would have a positive effect, for instance, and how successful they thought it would be in improving their wellbeing. They also completed a number of other scales, including measures of wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and personality traits. Then, once they began microdosing, participants completed weekly measures of wellbeing, depression, and anxiety, and recorded how much of the drug they had taken and whether they had experienced any psychoactive effects.</p>



<p>The team found that after participants started microdosing, their wellbeing increased and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased. Most of these effects emerged in the first week of taking the drugs, then remained at a similar level for the rest of the four week period. But, importantly, their expectations in the week before beginning to take the drug predict the extent of these changes: those who had a greater expectation that microdosing would produce positive effects tended to show more positive changes in all three measures.</p>



<p>At first glance, it might seem like the study supports the use of microdosing. But the fact that people’s expectations were tied to their response suggests that what seems like a useful therapeutic effect might actually be a placebo effect, driven by what participants want or expect to occur. That could explain why previous placebo-controlled studies have found that microdosing doesn’t produce any beneficial response beyond that of a placebo. Of course, in this case there was no placebo arm of the study, so it’s impossible to tell for sure.</p>



<p>The authors also posit one other intriguing possibility: that the drugs do produce a pharmacological effect in the brain at this low dose, but this doesn’t boost wellbeing — instead, it actually accentuates the placebo response. For instance, microdosing might promote “plasticity” in the brain — the ability to reorganise networks and form new pathways — and this could potentially make any expectation effects even more pronounced. Again, only well-controlled trials will be able to determine whether that’s the case.</p>



<p>Whatever’s going on in the brain during microdosing, it’s clearly worth further examination. But as this study shows, in the absence of more rigorous research, there’s good reason to be sceptical of bold claims about the benefits of microdosing to people’s mental health.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-science-anniversaries-celebrate-2021">Top 10 science anniversaries to celebrate in 2021</a></h4>

<p>Centuries from now, 2021 will be celebrated as an anniversary year most noted for getting rid of 2020. It will be less remembered as a year featuring a diverse roster of scientific anniversaries, ranging from the 1300th birthday of a prolific writer to the 25th birthday of a celebrity sheep.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, before too much of 2021 passes by, it’s time to name the Top 10 anniversaries worthy of celebration this year — some obscure, some fairly famous, and one that had an unfair advantage helping to make it No. 1.</p>



<h4>10. Elizabeth Blackwell, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born in England in 1821, Blackwell moved with her family to New York in 1832 and a few years later to Ohio, where she became a teacher in a boarding school. After the death of a close friend she began applying to medical schools, acquiring a bunch of rejections until Geneva College sent her an acceptance letter (apparently the faculty sought input from the school’s students, and they voted to accept her as a joke). But she showed up and the college honored its agreement; <a href="https://cfmedicine.nlm.nih.gov/physicians/biography_35.html">she became America’s first licensed woman medical doctor</a>. She went to Europe for two years for advanced medical training and returned to the United States and opened a clinic in New York City to serve poor women and children. Eventually, she established a medical college specifically for women before returning to England to practice medicine there. She died in 1910.</p>





<h4>9. Jabir Ibn Hayyan, 1,300th birthday</h4>



<p>OK, this one is a little shaky, because 721 is just the internet’s best guess for Jabir’s birth year. Besides that, there is some <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/jabir">question in the science history literature</a> about whether this guy even actually existed. Nevertheless, he is pretty famous, supposedly having authored thousands of books, focusing on alchemy but also exploring astronomy and astrology, medicine, cosmology and a lot of other fields of early medieval science. He developed many chemical processes useful for metallurgy, dyes, glassmaking and medicine, among other applications.  </p>



<p>Experts agree that Jabir could not have written all the books attributed to him; some in fact seem to have been written much later than the time of his death in about 815. It may even be that he was a collective group of authors choosing to write under one name. And his Latinized name, Geber, has been a source of some confusion since a 13th century writer chose that as a pseudonym for writing alchemical treatises.</p>



<p>In any case, the original Jabir, if he existed, was certainly one of his age’s brightest minds. He is considered by some to deserve the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6077026/">title of father of chemistry</a> (at least in the Arabic-speaking world) and also a founder of modern pharmacy. Because one of his books was written in an incomprehensible code, some have thought the word <em>gibberish</em> was derived from Jabir. But modern language experts say that the idea that <em>gibberish</em> comes from Jabir is balderdash.</p>



<h4>8. Rosalyn Yalow, 100th birthday</h4>



<p>Yalow, born Rosalyn Sussman, described herself as a “stubborn, determined child” and an avid reader who developed an interest in math and chemistry. In college, she was captivated by physics, and she earned a Ph.D. in nuclear physics in 1945. After some time teaching, she turned her research —developing the use of radioactive isotopes for precise measurements of biological chemicals in the body — from hormones and enzymes to vitamins and viruses. That work won her a share of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1977/yalow/biographical/">1977 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine</a>. The year before, she was awarded the Lasker Prize for medical research — the first nuclear physicist to receive that honor. She died in 2011.</p>



<h4>7. Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz, centennial of death</h4>



<p><em>Waldeyer</em>–<em>Hartz, </em>born in 1836<em>, </em>was a German anatomist, famed in his day as an outstanding teacher and lecturer. He made numerous contributions to the understanding of human anatomy and the terminology for describing it (although some of his anatomical conclusions turned out to be erroneous).</p>



<p>His most <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2017.00074/full">noteworthy coinages</a> were <em>chromosome</em>, for the structures containing DNA in the cell’s nucleus, and <em>neuron</em> for nerve cells. He named chromosomes in 1888, before their exact nature was well-known. Similarly, he introduced the term <em>neuron</em> before scientists had even reached agreement on whether such cells existed. Around the end of the 19th century, various studies on nerve tissue had provided clues to its structure; Waldeyer-Hartz summarized the evidence that its building blocks were in fact discrete, individual cells, the neurons.</p>



<h4>6. Dolly the Sheep, 25th birthday</h4>



<p>No sheep ever made bigger headlines than Dolly the Sheep, when scientists announced her existence in February 1997. (She had been born on July 5, 1996.) Before Dolly, most scientists doubted that a mammal could be <a href="https://dolly.roslin.ed.ac.uk/facts/the-life-of-dolly/index.html">cloned from an adult cell</a>, although some cases of cloning from embryonic cells had been reported. <a>But Dolly was cloned by scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh </a><a>using a mammary cell from an adult sheep implanted in an egg from a black-faced sheep.</a></p>



<p>Dolly’s birth instantly made the film <em>Jurassic Park</em> seem more realistic and raised the specter of human cloning, boosting VHS rentals of <em>The Boys from Brazil</em>. Dolly seemed to be a perfectly typical sheep (although the telomeres capping the ends of her chromosomes were a tad shorter than usual) and had several offspring of her own. According to the Roslin Institute, she lived a normal life (except for the occasional media appearance) until infected with a cancer-causing virus during an outbreak in the lab, leading to her death at age 6 in 2003.</p>





<h4>5. Ernest Rutherford, 150th birthday</h4>



<p>Born in New Zealand in 1871, Rutherford attended the University of Cambridge and soon became <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-anatomy">the world’s premier experimental physicist</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/11</em>). His early work at McGill University in Montreal established the basic principles of the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity. In 1911, at the University of Manchester in England, he deduced the existence of the atomic nucleus in analyzing results of experiments by his assistants Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. It was one of the most astounding and significant insights into the ultimate architecture of microscopic nature since the Greeks proposed the idea of atoms.</p>



<p>Later, Rutherford demonstrated the transmutation of one element to another and predicted the existence of a new subatomic particle, the neutron. When he died in 1937, the great atomic physicist Niels Bohr, who had studied under Rutherford at Manchester, remarked that, like Galileo, Rutherford had “left science in quite a different state from that in which he found it.”</p>



<h4>4. DNA discovery published, 150th anniversary</h4>



<p>Johann Friedrich Miescher, born in 1844 in Basel, Switzerland, went to medical school but chose a career in research rather than clinical practice. Biochemistry was a young science back then, as biologists were just beginning to understand the chemical contents of a living cell and how they interacted to drive cellular activity. A leader in the new field was Felix Hoppe-Seyler at the University of Tübingen in Germany, and Miescher went to work in his lab in 1868.</p>



<p>Miescher soon began to study white blood cells in pus from surgery patients in a nearby clinic. He found that the cell nucleus contained a substance that differed dramatically from the proteins and lipids in the rest of the cell. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604008231">He called the new substance nuclein, later identified as DNA</a>. Although Miescher made his discovery in 1869, Hoppe-Seyler wasn’t convinced and insisted on repeating the experiments himself, delaying publication until 1871.</p>



<p>Miescher believed that nuclein would turn out to be just as important as proteins. He did not realize that DNA was the carrier of heredity. But he did show that it was found in the sperm cells of many animals, a clue not fully appreciated until 1944, a century after his birth, when DNA was established to be the substance of genes. Miescher died in 1895.</p>



<h4>3. Maxwell’s demon, 150th birthday</h4>



<p>In 1871, <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryheat02maxwgoog/page/n6/mode/2up">in his book <em>Theory of Heat</em></a>, James Clerk Maxwell introduced the public to the idea of “a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course.” This hypothetical creature, later called “Maxwell’s demon” by the physicist William Thomson, was imagined by Maxwell to illustrate a quirk in the second law of thermodynamics.</p>



<p>In one popular version of the second law, hot (fast) and cold (slow) molecules always mix to reach an intermediate temperature. But a demon capable of tracking molecular velocities could sort the fast ones from the slow ones and reverse the normal equalizing of temperature. Such a demon would soon be very wealthy from providing free air conditioning in the summer and free heating in the winter. Maxwell’s point was not that the demon was a lawbreaker, but that the second law was statistical. Its validity depended on the impossibility of keeping track of trillions and trillions of molecules, something no real demon, or human, could manage.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the demon haunted physicists for decades. In 1929, Leo Szilard claimed that the demon could not break the second law because it needed more energy to make its measurements than it could recover by sorting the molecules. But decades later, IBM physicist Charles Bennett, drawing on work by his IBM colleague Rolf Landauer, showed that the demon could track molecular velocities with as little energy as it wanted; the payback came when the demon had to erase data in its memory to make room for new observations. Erasure of information, Landauer had shown, always requires a minimum amount of energy, putting the second law securely back in the physics lawbook.</p>



<h4>2. Hermann von Helmholtz, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born in Potsdam (in the kingdom of Prussia) in 1821, Helmholtz was one of the 19th century’s most versatile scientists; his name turns up in the histories of multiple scientific fields and specialties. As a youngster, he had an interest in physics, but as that seemed a financially unwise career choice, he went to medical school and studied physiology instead. He was drawn to others who promoted the view that physiology should be based on the principles of chemistry and physics, not the “vital forces” that had been popularly emphasized previously.</p>



<p>After earning his medical degree, Helmholtz served as an army surgeon before becoming professor of physiology at the University of <a>Königsberg</a>. During that time, he composed a groundbreaking paper on the conservation of energy. While at Königsberg, he studied the nervous system, optics and acoustics, especially with regard to the physiology of the senses. He moved on to the University of Bonn as professor of anatomy and physiology, although he wasn’t very good at anatomy and shifted his attention to the physics of whirlpools in fluids.</p>



<p>After some time at the University of Heidelberg, where he became interested in philosophy, epistemology and the foundations of geometry, in 1871 he was awarded the physics chair at the University of Berlin. At last he could focus on physics, emphasizing the importance of the principle of least action for explaining physical phenomena. He also explored the ramifications of Maxwell’s new theory of electromagnetism, as well as dabbling in chemical thermodynamics and meteorology. By this time, he was recognized as one of Germany’s premier scientists, until his death in 1894.</p>



<h4>1. Founding of Science Service, centennial</h4>



<p>A century ago, newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps and biologist William Emerson Ritter perceived the need for better science journalism to serve the American public. They joined forces to create Science Service, which began syndicating articles about the frontiers of science to newspapers around the country.</p>



<p>The first week packet of such stories, labeled <em>Science News Bulletin</em>, was dispatched on April 2, 1921. Soon science enthusiasts sought personal subscriptions to Science Service’s weekly news, leading to the birth of <em>Science News-Letter</em> (on March 13, 1922) — a new weekly magazine available by subscription for $5 per year.</p>



<p>Today <em>Science News-Letter</em> is <em>Science News</em>, and Science Service is the Society for Science, but the philosophy is the same: to provide the public with the important news from the world of science in an understandable, yet accurate and authoritative form. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/about">Celebrating anniversaries</a>, not part of the original mission, is a bonus.</p>

A math professor named as a “highly cited researcher” by Clarivate Analytics has had his third paper retracted after issues with it were flagged last year.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-new-high-energy-light-gamma-glow-secrets-cosmic-rays">The Milky Way’s newfound high-energy glow hints at the secrets of cosmic rays</a></h4>

<p>The Milky Way glows with a gamma ray haze, with energies vastly exceeding anything physicists can produce on Earth, according to a new paper. Gamma rays detected in the study, to be published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, came from throughout the galaxy’s disk, and reached <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2207cYd3La91536bf3509f3189e65322ea6e4b7e0">nearly a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) electron volts</a>, known as a petaelectron volt or PeV.</p>



<p>These diffuse gamma rays hint at the existence of powerful cosmic particle accelerators within the Milky Way. Physicists believe such accelerators are the source of mysterious, highly energetic cosmic rays, charged particles that careen through the galaxy, sometimes crash-landing on Earth. When cosmic rays — which mainly consist of protons — slam into interstellar debris, they can produce gamma rays, a form of high-energy light.  </p>



<p>Certain galactic environments could rev up cosmic ray particles to more than a PeV, scientists suspect. In comparison, the Large Hadron Collider, the premier particle accelerator crafted by humans, accelerates protons to 6.5 trillion electron volts. But physicists haven’t definitively identified any natural cosmic accelerators capable of reaching a PeV, known as PeVatrons. One possibility is that supernova remnants, the remains of exploded stars, host <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-death-giant-lasers-explosive-mysterious-physics">shock waves</a> that can accelerate cosmic rays to such energies (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>If PeVatrons exist, the cosmic rays they emit would permeate the galaxy, producing a diffuse glow of gamma rays of extreme energies. That’s just what researchers with the Tibet AS-gamma experiment have found. “It’s nice to see things fitting together,” says physicist David Hanna of McGill University in Montreal, who was not involved with the study.</p>





<p>After cosmic rays are spewed out from their birthplaces, scientists believe, they roam the galaxy, twisted about by its magnetic fields. “We live in a bubble of cosmic rays,” says astrophysicist Paolo Lipari of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Rome, who was not involved with the research. Because they are not deflected by magnetic fields, gamma rays point back to their sources, revealing the whereabouts of the itinerant cosmic rays. The new study “gives you information about how these particles fill the galaxy.”</p>



<p>Lower-energy gamma rays also permeate the galaxy. But it takes higher-energy gamma rays to understand the highest-energy cosmic rays. “In general, the higher the energy of the gamma rays, the higher the energy of the cosmic rays,” says astrophysicist Elena Orlando of Stanford University, who was not involved with the research. “Hence, the detection … tells us that PeV cosmic rays originate and propagate in the galactic disk.”</p>



<p>Scientists with the Tibet AS-gamma experiment in China observed gamma rays with energies between about 100 trillion and a quadrillion electron volts coming from the region of the sky covered by the disk of the Milky Way. A search for possible sources of the 38 highest-energy gamma rays, above 398 trillion electron volts, came up empty, supporting the idea that the gamma rays came from cosmic rays that had wandered about the galaxy. The highest-energy gamma ray carried about 957 trillion electron volts.</p>



<p>Tibet AS-gamma researchers declined to comment on the study.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously seen extremely energetic gamma rays from individual sources within the Milky Way, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/highest-energy-photons-ever-seen-hail-crab-nebula">Crab Nebula</a>, a supernova remnant (<em>SN: 6/24/19</em>). Those gamma rays are probably produced in a different manner, by electrons radiating gamma rays while circulating within the cosmic accelerator.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-sea-reptile-mosasaur-fossil-razor-teeth">This ancient sea reptile had a slicing bite like no other</a></h4>

<p>Shortly before a mass extinction ended the Age of Dinosaurs, a reptilian, barracuda-like carnivore with a mouth like a box cutter patrolled the warm seas that once covered swaths of what is now North Africa. A recently described fossil of the ocean-dwelling beast reveals that its bite was unlike that of any of its relatives, in the water or onshore. </p>



<p>The animal was a mosasaur, an extinct, marine reptile related to snakes and monitor lizards. Mosasaurs commonly had piercing, conical teeth for gripping slippery prey or flat, crushing teeth for smashing hard-shelled animals. But this new variety had short, serrated, squarish blades, packed tightly in series to form a knife’s cutting edge. This mouth of razors is unique among mosasaurs, and even within the entirety of the tetrapod lineage, mostly landlubbing vertebrates that include amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. </p>



<p>The discovery, described January 16 in <em>Cretaceous Research</em>, suggests that mosasaurs were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2021.104764">evolving experimental physical traits and lifestyles right up until their abrupt extinction</a> 66 million years ago. </p>



<p>Phosphate miners in Morocco found the curious fossil: a chunk of upper jaw studded with teeth. The jaw came from a mosasaur living at the very end of the Cretaceous Period. Many mosasaurs were massive predators, some stretching longer than a school bus. But this fossil belonged to an animal just over a meter long, Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the University of Bath in England, and his colleagues determined. </p>





<p>Longrich says the animal’s small size is interesting, but that’s not what caught his eye. “Those teeth are just unlike anything I’ve seen in a lizard before,” Longrich says. The team named the mosasaur <em>Xenodens calminechari </em>— <em>Xenodens </em>means “strange tooth;” <em>calminechari</em> is Arabic for “like a saw.”</p>



<p>Longrich says the closest match for <em>X. calminechari</em>’s teeth appear to be those of modern-day dogfish sharks, which can “cut large bolts of flesh out as they scavenge,” he says. “Probably these slicing teeth allowed it to process a huge range of foods,” says Longrich, noting that dogfish sharks use their teeth to chop up everything from fish to sea anemones. Despite its small size, <em>X. calminechari</em> may have been able to prey upon quite large animals or scavenge their remains, since it shared its watery home with big fish and cephalopods, as well as orca-sized, long-necked plesiosaurs.</p>

<p>The fossil is “completely bizarre,” says Paulina Jiménez-Huidobro, a paleontologist at the University of Bonn in Germany not involved with this research, noting the teeth may have been used to “slice and dice” crustaceans, shell and all. </p>



<p>She has doubts about the comparison to shark feeding methods and diet based solely on the tooth shape, though, because of fundamental differences between how sharks and mosasaurs bite prey. Shark teeth cut into flesh on jaws that extend outwards towards prey independently of the skull. </p>



<p>“This mechanism does not occur in mosasaurs, even if <em>Xenodens</em> has a shark-like tooth shape,” Jiménez-Huidobro says. “No lizard can do that.”</p>



<p>For Longrich, <em>X. calminechari</em>’s discovery helps paint a picture of the late Cretaceous’ tropical seas as teeming with biodiversity before a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impact-volcanism-earth-dinosaurs-deccan-mass-extinction">dinosaur-era-ending asteroid</a> hit Earth (<em>SN: 6/17/20</em>). The ocean ecosystem was thriving at the time, so there may have been dozens of mosasaur species in a single habitat, he says, and they weren’t done producing weird prototypes like <em>Xenodens</em>. </p>



<p>“The mosasaurs were still experimenting with new ways of feeding, new morphologies, new lifestyles just before that asteroid came down,” Longrich says.</p>



<p>Learning more about this nimble, barracuda-like sea lizard will reveal more of the evolutionary experimentation going on at the time, but gaining that understand requires the discovery of more fossil material, which could take a while, Longrich says. In half a dozen years of searching, he’s seen only one fossil of this species.</p>



<p>“Eventually something has to turn up, but it’s a waiting game.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>As anyone who’s ever flunked a test will tell you, doing well at school or university isn’t just a simple matter of intelligence, ability, or even of how hard you’ve worked. In fact, there are plenty of things that can affect the way we perform, from the way we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/04/what-do-todays-students-get-right-and-wrong-in-how-they-take-lecture-notes/">take notes</a> to how we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/">revise</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">how much sleep we get</a> while we’re studying.</p>



<p>And according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-30956-001">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, something else might have an impact on our educational achievements: our assumptions about our professors. If we believe they have faith in our ability to change and improve, suggest Katherine Muenks from the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues, we’re likely to enjoy classes more, as well as achieve higher grades.</p>



<span id="more-41286"></span>



<p>The research focused on participants’ beliefs about mindset. Those with a <em>fixed </em>mindset believe that intelligence or ability is innate and can’t be changed; those with a <em>growth</em> mindset believe that ability is malleable, and that if we work hard or adopt new strategies we will grow and learn.</p>



<p>Research has shown that our own mindset is likely to have an impact on how we behave, how motivated we feel, and what we achieve. But the new study looked at how students’ perceptions of their STEM professors’ mindset affected their experience and engagement in classes.</p>



<p>In the first experiment, participants watched a short video clip from the first day of a university calculus course in which a professor expressed his beliefs about what it took to do well in the class. In one condition, the professor expressed beliefs suggesting a fixed mindset (“You either have the skills or you don’t”), in another expressed growth mindset beliefs (“The assignments are designed to help you improve your skills”), and in the third expressed no mindset beliefs.</p>



<p>Those who watched the fixed mindset video anticipated feeling significantly less belonging and less engagement in the class than those who were shown the growth mindset video, and expressed more concerns about being evaluated negatively. Meanwhile, those who watched the growth mindset video anticipated higher engagement in and effort towards the class than either the fixed mindset group or the control group, and expected to perform significantly better than their fixed mindset group counterparts. In a second study, replicating the first, growth mindset group participants also reported lower levels of impostor feelings and less likelihood of dropping the course.</p>



<p>The third study looked at how students felt about their professors’ mindset beliefs in the real world. Participants who were enrolled in STEM courses at three US universities completed a survey reporting their perceptions of their professors’ mindset beliefs, and provided their personal mindset beliefs and SAT scores. They then completed surveys measuring engagement and psychological experiences as in the previous two studies. As expected, those who saw their professors as having fixed mindset beliefs had greater concerns about the course, greater feelings of being an impostor, and increased negative affect in classes.</p>



<p>A final longitudinal study replicated these results, also finding that participants who felt their professor had fixed mindset beliefs were more likely to skip class than those who felt their professor had a growth mindset. There was also an indirect effect on actual performance in class: those who believed their professor had a fixed mindset felt less of a sense of belonging, which in turn predicted lower grades.</p>



<p>Mindset beliefs are clearly hugely important, both in terms of how people experience the classroom and their outcomes at the end of a course. But while changing student mindset beliefs may go some way to improving learning, it’s not enough — as the team suggests, the learning environment itself might need to change. Staff could be informed of the potential impact of their mindset beliefs, for instance, and be encouraged to help students adapt to particular courses or new skills.</p>



<p>Other studies have also suggested that women and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">first-generation university students are at greater risk of experiencing impostor syndrome</a>, particularly within STEM courses. Building confidence and reducing impostor feelings and psychological vulnerability could therefore improve not only student outcomes but diversity in STEM fields more generally — a serious incentive for teaching staff to think about their mindsets.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">COVID-19 precautions may be reducing cases of flu and other respiratory infections</a></h4>

<p>Heading into the dead of winter, doctors and scientists have noticed something odd: Missing cases of non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses, specifically flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing very low numbers of both of these infections, even now, while we’re in the peak season,” says Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist at Princeton University. “We really should be seeing cases go up.”</p>



<p>Instead, positive flu tests reported in December are a little less than one one-hundredth of all of those tallied in December 2019, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV’s drop in reported cases — to one two-hundredth of those a year earlier — is even bigger.</p>



<p>This dramatic dip is probably due to COVID-19 precautions. The same handwashing and social distancing that can prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can prevent the spread of other viruses and pathogens. But that could mean trouble ahead. A lack of cases ironically leads to a growing population susceptible to infection, so future outbreaks could be larger and more unpredictable.</p>

<p>In a typical year in the United States, RSV hospitalizes an estimated 58,000 children under age 5 and more than 177,000 older adults. “Most people recover in a week or two,” says Benjamin Silk, an epidemiologist at the CDC. “But RSV infections can be serious, especially for infants, older adults and people with certain chronic medical conditions.” Worldwide, 3.4 million children under 5 years old are hospitalized with RSV each year, accounting for about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616310121">5 percent of deaths in this age group</a>.</p>



<p>Highly contagious, RSV is transmitted through respiratory droplets, which can remain infectious for more than six hours on hard surfaces. Prevention is rooted in strict hand hygiene — using hand sanitizer or washing with soap and water.</p>



<p>In the United States, RSV season usually starts in the fall, peaking between December and mid-February. This year, there essentially is no peak. In December 2020, the CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System — which collects voluntarily reported data —reported just 120 RSV cases, compared with 24,280 in December 2019.</p>



<p>“RSV, in particular, is so stable — it does the same thing year after year,” Baker says. “I don’t think there’s much else that could explain [the drop] apart from the COVID-19 phenomena as a whole, particularly the control measures.”</p>



<p>Influenza infections are also down drastically. Flu regularly infects <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/10/1511/4682599">between 3</a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/10/1511/4682599"> percent </a>and 11<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/10/1511/4682599"> percent </a>of the U.S. population and is especially deadly for older or immunocompromised people. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=While the impact of flu,61%2C000 deaths annually since 2010.">CDC estimates</a> that in an average year, flu kills around 36,000 people and hospitalizes almost half a million.</p>



<p>According to the CDC’s lead flu tracker Lynnette Brammer, the adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures in the spring of 2020 coincided with a drop in the percent of positive flu tests from more than 20 percent to less than 1 percent — and that number has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">stayed low through the fall</a> and now into winter (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). In December 2019, the CDC’s clinical lab FluVue reported 50,526 positive flu tests. In December 2020, that number was just 454. Preliminary data suggest this trend is continuing into January, when flu season typically peaks.</p>



<p>Brammer says the numbers of flu tests are steady, so it’s not that people aren’t going to get tested. They just aren’t spreading it around as much.</p>

<p>Positive tests for influenza and RSV have dropped drastically since COVID-19 prevention measures were put into place in March 2020.</p>

<p>Some other infections, like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/human-paraflu/natl-trend.html">parainfluenza</a>, also seem to have declined with COVID-19 prevention measures, but viruses like <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/covid-19-surveillance-report-20210102.pdf">rhinoviruses</a> continue near their normal season levels. It could be because these viruses, unlike flu and RSV, aren’t as thoroughly destroyed by handwashing and using sanitizers.</p>



<p>This great news comes with a warning, though. Fewer infections means fewer people being exposed and gaining immunity to these viruses, building up a population susceptible to these infections later. That could fuel <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30547">a deadly rebound in infections</a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30547"> post COVID-19</a>, Baker, the Princeton epidemiologist, and her colleagues reported December 1 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. In the analysis, the team assumed COVID-19 precautions would reduce RSV and influenza infections by 20 percent, but the decrease is proving to be much larger.</p>



<p>“We need to be prepared for offseason outbreaks and potentially large outbreaks,” Baker says.</p>



<p>That’s what’s happening right now in Australia’s New South Wales. Clinical nurse Gemma Saravanos and her colleagues observed a more than 85 percent <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30307-2/fulltext">reduction of positive RSV tests</a> during the peak of their season, between April and June, the team reported in the <em>Lancet</em> in September. But now, after beating back COVID-19 and lifting stringent protective measures, they have a record-breaking offseason RSV outbreak on their hands. In the last two weeks of December 2020, NSW reported more than 6,000 positive RSV tests — during a time they typically have a few hundred. In 2019, the RSV season peaked at around 4,695 detections in May.</p>



<p>“It’s really extraordinarily unusual,” says Saravanos, who works at the University of Sydney. “It’s never been seen before.”</p>



<p>A rebound outbreak might hit the United States, too, Baker says. Australia “could be an interesting foreshadowing of what is to come in the Northern Hemisphere.”</p>

<p>That worries Carla Burroughs, a mother of four and former medic in Mobile, Ala., who has experienced RSV first hand. “The first time I heard of RSV, I was working on an ambulance, and I [transported] a child who passed away [from it],” she says. Then in December 2019, Burroughs’ 3-year-old daughter, Kaylee, caught RSV and was hospitalized for three days. “The second the doctor told us RSV with Kaylee, it just brought flashbacks. It just sent me into such a panic mode; I immediately knew this is going to be bad.”</p>



<p>It did get bad. A week later, Burroughs’ infant twins caught RSV. One, Mackenzie, was intubated for two weeks and stayed in the hospital for over a month. Seeing her daughter struggling to breathe, Boroughs says, “just changed everything. It took more of a toll on me than I expected.”</p>



<p>Burroughs’ children recovered, and she says now the new data show just how important basic hygiene behaviors are to helping prevent the spread of these viruses, saving thousands of lives every RSV and flu season — even without a pandemic. “It’s sad that [the pandemic] is what it came down to,” Burroughs says. “We should have already been doing all these things.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ship-tracks-exhaust-studies-overestimate-cooling-pollution-clouds">Ship exhaust studies overestimate cooling from pollution-altered clouds</a></h4>

<p>Among the biggest questions for climate change forecasters is how atmospheric aerosols shape clouds, which can help cool the planet. Now, a new study finds that one promising strategy for understanding how aerosols and clouds interact can <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abd3980">overestimate the cooling ability</a> of pollution-generated clouds by up to 200 percent, researchers report in the Jan. 29 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“Clouds in general, and how aerosols interact with the climate, are a big uncertainty in climate models,” says Franziska Glassmeier, an atmospheric scientist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Scientists know that aerosols — both natural, as from volcanoes, and human-caused, as from pollution — can change a cloud’s thickness, ability to scatter sunlight or how much rainfall it produces. But these complicated physical effects are difficult to simulate, so scientists have sought real-world examples to study these effects.</p>



<p>Enter ship tracks. Exhaust belched out of massive cargo ships crossing the oceans can form these bright lines of clouds. The tiny exhaust particles act as cloud nuclei: Water vapor condenses on the particles to form cloud droplets, the watery stuff of clouds. Ship tracks are “this prime example where we can see this cause and effect,” Glassmeier says. “Put in particles, and you can see the clouds get brighter.” Brighter clouds means that they are reflecting even more sunlight back into space.</p>



<p>Visible and measurable by satellite, the tracks offer a potential window into how larger-scale industrial pollution around the globe might be altering the planet’s cloudscape — and perhaps how such clouds might affect the climate. Satellite-derived analyses of ship tracks involve measuring the density of the water droplets in the clouds from the images, and calculating how the brightness of the clouds changes over time.</p>





<p>To assess how well ship tracks actually represent the overall impact of pollution on clouds, Glassmeier and her colleagues compared the cooling effect of ship track clouds with that of simulated pollution-derived clouds, such as might occur over a city. In particular, the researchers wanted to simulate how both the thickness and the brightness of the clouds — and therefore their cooling effect — might evolve over time, as a result of processes like rainfall and evaporation.</p>



<p>The problem, the team found, is that the ship tracks don’t tell the whole story. Ship tracks are short-lived, because the source of pollution is always on the move. But industrial pollution doesn’t tend to happen in a brief pulse: Instead, there is a steady influx of particles to the atmosphere. And that difference in inputs affects how natural clouds respond over time.</p>



<p>In both the ship track studies and the simulations of industrial pollution, clouds initially brighten and produce a cooling effect. That’s because, in both cases, the addition of abundant aerosol particles to the atmosphere gives water vapor numerous surfaces on which to condense, creating many small water droplets that form this brighter cloud and reflect incoming radiation.</p>



<p>After a few hours, however, as a ship moves on, the ship track goes away, and the pulse of pollution ceases, Glassmeier says. The initial brief bit of cooling subsides as the preexisting natural clouds return to their original, nonpolluted state.</p>



<p>But in the case of industrial pollutants, the natural clouds don’t return to their original state, the simulations show. Rather, the pollutants hasten the clouds’ demise. That’s because the tinier aerosol-seeded droplets begin to evaporate more quickly than larger, natural cloud droplets would. This increased evaporation thins the original cloud, allowing more heat through than if the pollutants never arrived. And that can ultimately have an overall warming, rather than cooling, effect on the climate, the team says.</p>



<p>“There is this timescale effect that needs to be taken into account,” Glassmeier says. Relying solely on ship track data to understand all sources of pollution misses this gradual thinning effect. “I wouldn’t throw all the ship track data away; we just need to interpret it in a new way.” Current climate models tend to omit this thinning effect, she says.</p>



<p>The new study is “really useful for helping to interpret aerosol-cloud relationships in satellite data,” says Edward Gryspeerdt, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study. It “demonstrates that the cloud response to aerosols is not instant, but evolves over time.”</p>



<p>Scientists have been aware that <a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.3589">ship tracks may not lead to cooling</a>, says Graeme Stephens, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. For example, Stephens notes that he and others have previously found that ship tracks can speed up cloud thinning by increasing the rate of evaporation at the tops of the clouds, while at the same time suppressing rainfall, which maintains some of the cloud’s thickness. These two competing responses make determining a cloud’s ultimate fate tricky.</p>



<p>But what ship tracks can do is act as “a controlled laboratory of sorts,” Stephens says. They “offer us a way to examine aerosol influences on clouds in a direct, concrete way.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/02/01/saving-the-catheter/">Saving the Catheter</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Bloodstream-infection-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nephrologists deal with catheter malfunctions and non-functional catheters on a daily basis, usually related to thrombosis. Nephrologists want every patient on chronic hemodialysis to have a more permanent type of vascular access such as a fistula or graft, but for some patients, this is not suitable or they may require a catheter while a fistula or graft is developing. In the United States in 2018, more than four out of every five patients receiving hemodialysis were using a fistula or graft (82.4%; 65.7% fistula and 16.7% graft). Meaning about 17.6% were using a catheter.</p>
<p>Given the time spent on trouble-shooting catheter malfunction or dealing with bloodstream infections, I’m always looking for new ways to prevent these complications related to catheters.  An <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02243-y">article by Richtrova <em>et al</em>.</a>, published last week in <em>BMC Nephrology</em>, looked at whether rt-PA vs trisodium citrate would prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections, catheter malfunction, or catheter non-function. It was a small study with only 18 patients, with the authors originally planning to recruit 80 patients. However, the recruitment rates are not unexpected given the efforts to keep catheter use low and increase fistula and graft use. Even with the small numbers, there are some findings worth keeping in mind. There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low in their population. Catheter patency (also known as being unobstructed) was more related to the time interval between sessions and if there were prior catheter malfunctions as opposed to the use of agents. The longer period without the use of a catheter will predispose catheter thrombosis leading to malfunction or non-function.</p>
<blockquote><p>There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low</p></blockquote>
<p>Other agents have been used to prevent thrombosis leading to catheter dysfunction. The most common anticoagulant locking solutions (meaning solutions used to fill catheters in between hemodialysis sessions to prevent clotting) are heparin and 4% citrate. In fact, the <a href="https://www.asdin.org/page/A2">American Society of Diagnostic Interventional Nephrologists</a> recommends that both heparin and 4% citrate are acceptable catheter locks. Thrombolytic agents like rt-PA have been looked at before. It has been <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/92/6/499">previously shown</a> that rt-PA is significantly more effective than heparin in preventing clot formation in hemodialysis catheters. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011376">Another study</a> previously compared rt-PA to heparin as a locking solution, concluding that there was a significantly reduced incidence of catheter malfunction and bacteremia. So why not switch to rt-PA as a locking solution for one out of three sessions per week? First, there is an issue of cost. Overall, nephrologists tend to use rt-PA as a treatment to fix the catheter when it stops working rather than as a prevention strategy.</p>
<p>Even though there are significant efforts to have a more permanent vascular access such as a fistula or graft, there are individuals that can only dialyze via a catheter. Since dialysis vascular access is a lifeline for hemodialysis patients, we should continue to look at options for maintenance and optimization of catheter function. The complications related to catheters, especially infections, have an unfavorable effect on morbidity, mortality, and cost. In addition, infections are the second most frequent cause of death in dialysis patients. This is why I’m always on the lookout for ways to preserve my patient’s catheter function.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Mozart famously started playing the piano and composing while still a young child. But if he hadn’t started musical practice then, would his future achievements have been as impressive? Is there, in other words, a “sensitive period” in which the brain is especially susceptible to musical stimulation, and during which a person must start to acquire musical skills in order to achieve their full potential — as is the case for visual perception, say, or language acquisition? There has been a lot of debate about this, but now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014">major new study</a> of professional musicians and identical and non-identical twins in Sweden suggests not. </p>



<span id="more-41275"></span>



<p>The 310 musicians studied by Laura Wesseldijk at the Karolinska Institute and colleagues were all either professionally active or students at a music college. They were aged between 27 and 54 (to match the age range of the twin sample) and had started musical training between the ages of two and 18. These participants reported on when they started that training and how many hours a week they had spent in music practice up to the age of 18, as well as in adulthood. Their musical aptitude was measured using an online test of ability to discriminate pitch, melody and rhythm. They also reported on their level of musical achievement, giving details of how many works they had composed and had performed, any radio or TV recordings, and any music awards, for example.</p>



<p>The twin data came from the Swedish Twin Registry. Some 7,786 twins reported having played music at some point in their lives, and of these, 4,814 had taken the same musical discrimination test, and 4,887 had provided information on their musical achievement (giving details of any compositions and amateur performances, or awards, for instance).</p>



<p>The team did indeed find that for both the professionals and twins, those who’d started their musical training before the age of 8 went on to develop greater musical aptitude <em>and</em> higher levels of achievement.</p>



<p>However, when the researchers took total lifetime hours of practice into account, only the link with musical aptitude remained — and it became limited. Starting training at a younger age was associated with better pitch — but not rhythm — discrimination. (This tallies with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895917/">some recent work</a> finding that children who received musical training before the age of 7 did better on melody, but not rhythm, tests than children who’d started their training later.)</p>



<p>And when the researchers looked more closely at the twin data (by considering, for example, pairs of identical twins who had started musical training at different ages, and data for identical vs nonidentical twins), they found that the association between starting training earlier and doing better later could be fully explained by shared genetic and environmental factors . That is, there was no need to invoke a “sensitive period” to explain why kids who start musical training in early childhood tend to do better later, but instead musicians (professional or amateur) who start tuition earlier and do better on the tests later may have benefitted from inheriting “musical” genes from their parents <em>and</em> from growing up in a musical environment at home. Their parents may have been better able to spot and foster musical talent in the children, and organised tuition for these children at a younger age, which made for more lifetime practice hours.</p>



<p>In fact, the new results “provide little direct support that early training has a specific, causal effect on later performance and achievement,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>There are other fields — notably sport — in which it’s also been suggested that there’s a sensitive period for training in childhood, to maximise later performance. However, findings in this area have been mixed, too. Some studies that have found a benefit to starting early have failed to take into account total lifetime hours of practice, the researchers point out. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923322/">One 2017 study of athletes</a> even found that those who’d won medals had specialised in their main sport significantly later than non-medallists (though they had been involved in other sports for longer).</p>



<p>In the field of music, starting early is clearly associated with better later performance. But if you’re worrying that perhaps you’ve missed a critical window of greater brain responsiveness for your own child to start musical training, the lesson from the new work seems to be: don’t.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014">Why Is an Early Start of Training Related to Musical Skills in Adulthood? A Genetically Informative Study</a></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diabetes-pregnancy-gestational-heart-trouble-later-life">Diabetes during pregnancy is tied to heart trouble later in life</a></h4>

<p>Diabetes brought on by pregnancy might set a woman up for heart trouble later on, even if her blood sugar levels snap back to normal. That finding, from a large, long-term study, suggests that doctors should pay careful attention to the hearts of people who previously had gestational diabetes.</p>



<p>The results, published online February 1 in <em>Circulation</em>, come from data collected by the CARDIA Study, a project designed to track heart health in young adults in the United States. Starting in 1985, CARDIA enrolled equal numbers of Black and white people, ages 18 to 30, from four cities. Following these people for 25 years, researchers looked for coronary artery calcification, or CAC, a hardening of blood vessels that can signal future heart disease.</p>



<p>More than a thousand participants gave birth during the study. Of these women, 139 had gestational diabetes, an often-temporary condition in which blood sugar levels spike. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047320">About a quarter of women who had this pregnancy complication</a> — 34 women — went on to have CAC, even when post-pregnancy blood sugar levels normalized, researchers report. A smaller proportion of women who hadn’t had gestational diabetes — 149 of 994, or about 15 percent — went on to have CAC.</p>



<p>The study doesn’t indicate whether some aspect of gestational diabetes causes CAC, only that the two are linked. But it’s possible that changes in blood vessels that can accompany gestational diabetes may play a role in heart health later, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Although the link between gestational diabetes and future CAC is disheartening, “the majority of women with gestational diabetes do not develop coronary artery calcification,” says Khadijah Breathett, a cardiologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson who was not involved with the study. Still, the results highlight the importance of keeping blood sugar under control, she says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-treatment">The antidepressant fluvoxamine could keep mild COVID-19 from worsening</a></h4>

<p>The antidepressant fluvoxamine could prevent people from getting seriously ill with COVID-19, curbing hospitalizations, new data show.</p>



<p>The results come from real-world use of the drug to treat workers at the Golden Gate Fields horse racing track in Berkeley, Calif. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofab050/6124100?searchresult=1">Of those who opted to take fluvoxamine, none got sicker</a>, and within two weeks, their symptoms cleared. In comparison, 12.5 percent of those who turned down the drug wound up hospitalized. Two got so sick they were put on a ventilator to assist with breathing, and one died, researchers report February 1 in <em>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>The data need verification from ongoing larger clinical trials. However, some experts say that the new findings, along with cell, animal and human observational data, suggest that a two-week course of fluvoxamine, which costs about $10 and is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, could be considered for patients at high risk of suffering severe COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Racetrack physician David Seftel and David Boulware, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, led the real-world test of fluvoxamine after <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/11/25/how-did-200-racetrack-workers-at-golden-gate-fields-get-covid-19">hundreds of workers became infected with the virus</a> around Thanksgiving. Earlier that month, Seftel had heard about fluvoxamine during a presentation by tech entrepreneur Steve Kirsch, whose <a href="https://www.treatearly.org/">COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund</a> supports research on existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat coronavirus infections.</p>



<p>Kirsch shared results from a fund-supported randomized trial in which none of 80 newly diagnosed <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773108">COVID-19 patients assigned to a two-week course of fluvoxamine</a> became seriously ill. By comparison, six of 72 patients, or 8.3 percent, who took placebo tablets worsened and needed hospitalization, researchers reported in November in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just the trial results that intrigued Seftel, however. “I immediately dove into the biochemistry,” he says.</p>



<p>The drug’s biochemistry implied it might be able to regulate cellular responses to stress and infection. Fluvoxamine, which is sold as Luvox, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI, typically prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disorder. SSRIs increase levels of the chemical messenger serotonin in the brain. The drugs, most notably fluvoxamine, also activate a protein called the sigma-1 receptor that prevents production of chemical messengers that exacerbate inflammatory reactions.</p>



<p>In a 2019 study that inspired the randomized trial, mice that lacked sigma-1 receptor died from systemic inflammation known as sepsis, whereas <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/478/eaau5266.abstract">fluvoxamine treatment protected animals</a> from deterioration and death. In addition, lab dish experiments described in the Dec. 4 <em>Science</em> showed that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6521/eabe9403.long">knocking down levels of sigma-1 receptor</a> in cultured cells lowered infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Fluvoxamine also blocks activation of platelets, blood components important for clotting. This anti-platelet activity, together with the mouse and cell data, explain how fluvoxamine might squelch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-genetics-immune-responses-severe-cases">out-of-control immune activity</a> and prevent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-dangerous-blood-clots">blood clots</a> — both key features of severe COVID-19 (<em>SN: 9/25/20; SN:11/02/20</em>).</p>

<p>Seftel shared the emerging data on fluvoxamine with 113 infected track workers and offered a 14-day course of fluvoxamine — 50 milligrams taken twice a day — provided by the racetrack facility at no cost to those who could safely take the drug. The group was predominantly male and Latino, and 30 percent had chronic medical problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>



<p>Sixty-five people chose to take the drug, and 48 declined. The treatment group had a higher proportion of Latinos and tended to be sicker — 62 percent entered the study with COVID-19 symptoms compared with 42 percent of the group that declined treatment. No one who chose to take the drug suffered serious complications and, after 14 days, none reported lingering symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue and brain fog. But six of 48 people who declined fluvoxamine were hospitalized and one died. What’s more, 60 percent still reported experiencing a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath and muscle and joint pain two weeks after their diagnosis.</p>



<p>The racetrack study adds to evidence that there may be a benefit to giving the drug even though it wasn’t a randomized, controlled trial, which many consider to be the gold standard for clinical evidence. “It wasn’t blinded. Overt and unconscious bias can occur when you know who’s getting treatment or not,” says Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious diseases physician at UCLA who was not involved with the research. But “it definitely reduces the likelihood that the first study was just by chance.”</p>



<p>Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis are testing fluvoxamine in a larger, randomized <a href="https://stopcovidtrial.wustl.edu/">nationwide trial</a> financed by Kirsch’s fund and other philanthropic sources. Participants get pills, either fluvoxamine or placebo, shipped to their homes, along with a thermometer, pulse oximeter and blood-pressure monitor. They take the pills for 15 days and log symptoms on a web-based platform. So far, the trial has enrolled 168 people, says coinvestigator Angela Reiersen, a child psychiatrist. The team is hoping to collect data from 880 people.</p>



<p>Randomized trials in <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04711863">Korea</a>, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04727424">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04718480">Hungary</a> are also investigating fluvoxamine as a possible treatment in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate illness.</p>





<p>Typically doctors wait for clear answers from large, randomized trials to decide how best to treat patients. However, given the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/health/covid-drugs-antivirals.html">dearth of treatment options</a> and the urgency of the pandemic, Klausner says doctors should consider counseling patients about promising treatment options despite limited data that awaits more definitive evidence from ongoing studies.</p>



<p>“I am not ready to see fluvoxamine recommended in national treatment guidelines just yet,” he wrote in a Jan. 27 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/01/27/covid-19-experimental-treatments/">op-ed in the <em>Washington Post</em></a>. “But I am ready to try it with individual patients who are at increased risk of bad outcomes.”</p>



<p>Reiersen agrees. Considering the wealth of data from cell, animal and clinical studies, “there is a reasonable amount of evidence that it is probably helpful — more for fluvoxamine than [for] pretty much anything [else] out there for outpatient treatment,” she says.</p>

<p>As more COVID-19 vaccines show signs of being able to protect people from getting really sick, they’re fueling hopes that some sense of normalcy is within reach. Two vaccines have been authorized for emergency use in the United States and are slowly getting into arms across the country. And two more vaccine makers have just reported fairly positive results — a crucial step on the path toward adding tools to quell the pandemic.</p>



<p>As a result, people are looking forward to finally being able to safely hug loved ones, travel and go to work, school or the store without fear of falling ill. But the rocky vaccine rollout across the country — plus ensuring enough people are vaccinated to reach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-herd-immunity-immune-response-antibodies">herd immunity</a> and slow the virus’ spread — means it’s likely going to take time for such hope to become reality (<em>SN: 10/19/20</em>). Exactly how much time is unclear, though public health experts have said it may take until late summer or fall.   </p>



<p>Still, every shot means that the person who received it is less likely to get sick. And every vaccinated person, along with continued public health measures like wearing masks, brings us one step closer to the end of the pandemic and a breath of relief.</p>



<p>Amidst the whirlwind of information about the peril and promise of COVID-19 vaccines, here are answers to some commonly asked questions about the shots.</p>





<h4>How many different vaccines are there in the United States?</h4>



<p>Two mRNA vaccines — developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — are making it into arms across the United States. And the shots could soon be joined by at least one or two others.</p>

<p>Novavax announced January 28 that its vaccine has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">89.3 percent efficacy against COVID-19</a>, according to a Phase III clinical trial in the United Kingdom. However, that vaccine is less effective against a coronavirus variant that has emerged in South Africa (<em>SN:1/28/21</em>).</p>



<p>And Johnson &amp; Johnson announced on January 29 that its vaccine had an efficacy of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-results-variants">72 percent against moderate to severe COVID-19</a> in the United States. That vaccine is also less effective against preventing that level of sickness in people exposed to the variant from South Africa, though it did prevent deaths (<em>SN: 1/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to submit applications for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early February. It is unclear whether Novavax will do the same, as the company’s clinical trial in the United States is ongoing.   </p>



<h4>The FDA said the mRNA vaccines were safe when it OK’d their use. Is that still true?</h4>



<p>Yes. Health experts have been watching newly vaccinated people closely and so far, the vaccine has proven safe.</p>



<p>“We really have to weigh [vaccine risks] against a very imminent risk [of] becoming infected and becoming sick with this virus that is circulating everywhere,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. And so far, both Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines come with low risks compared with those of COVID-19.</p>



<p>The FDA required vaccine developers to have two months of safety data from clinical trials before applying for emergency use authorization. The vaccines do have some side effects, including fever, arm soreness, redness at the injection site, headache and feeling sick. Such symptoms are not unexpected, as they are a sign that the immune system is kicking into gear and are common side effects for vaccinations in general.</p>



<p>Some people have had severe allergic reactions to Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines. But all were quickly treated and none died.</p>



<p>Two U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–led studies found that both vaccines have higher rates of allergic reactions — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm?s_cid=mm7002e1_w">11.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses</a> for Pfizer’s and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e1.htm">2.5 cases per 1 million vaccine doses</a> for Moderna’s — than allergic reactions to the flu vaccine, which is 1.3 cases per 1 million doses. Still, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-severe-allergic-reactions-extremely-rare-cdc">such reactions</a> are “exceedingly rare,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory diseases said in a Jan. 6 news briefing (<em>SN:1/6/21</em>).</p>



<h4>Why is it so hard to get a vaccine?</h4>



<p>Vaccine distribution in the United States has been plagued with problems. Not only are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-last-mile-logistics-pfizer-moderna">limited doses available</a> to people in currently eligible groups but everyone who gets Moderna’s or Pfizer’s vaccines needs two shots for full protection (<em>SN: 12/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>The logistical issues also come in part because each state — sometimes down to the county or town level — is handling the situation in their own way, Barry Bloom, an immunologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said January 28 in a call with journalists. Who is even eligible for the shots varies from place to place, causing confusion and frustration. Such a local response “is very difficult to coordinate, which I think is a real tragedy and a hindrance to knowing exactly where the vaccines are needed, exactly how many doses should go, which vaccines they have the facilities for,” Bloom said</p>



<p>The situation may change as the Biden administration begins implementing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-biden-administration-plan-response">plans to help states fast-track vaccine rollout</a>, including administering at least 100 million doses before April 30 (<em>SN: 1/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>There are also stark disparities among which regions of the world are getting vaccines. The great majority of vaccine doses — more than 39 million — have gone to the world’s richest 49 countries. So while vaccines are hard to come by in places like the United States, it’s even more difficult in countries with lower incomes. </p>



<h4>After getting a shot, do we need to continue to wear masks and social distance?</h4>



<p>Yes, wearing a mask and keeping distance are still essential, even for individuals who have already gotten a shot.</p>



<p>The vaccines are very effective at preventing people from developing COVID-19 symptoms, but it’s unknown whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccines-questions-social-distance-mask-transmission">vaccinated people could still get infected without having symptoms and unknowingly spread the coronavirus to others</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/20</em>). Not all vaccines stop both disease and transmission. Vaccinations for influenza, pertussis and polio, for example, can stop people from getting severely ill if infected, but those people could still be contagious.  </p>



<p>People who have been vaccinated should follow public health guidelines to protect those who have not yet gotten shots, at least until scientists know more about the vaccines and transmission. Also, Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective, meaning not everyone who gets vaccinated develops a robust immune response that protects against COVID-19. So, with transmission rates still high in many parts of the world, including the United States, and large swaths of the population still unvaccinated, it’s best to err on the side of caution.</p>



<h4>The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine reported lower efficacy than Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. Should I get it?</h4>



<p>Here are some reasons why it’s worth getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine if that’s the one available to you.</p>



<p>It was 85 percent effective at preventing people from dying of COVID-19. That’s still a really high level of protection. In clinical trials, vaccine efficacy measures how many fewer cases of disease happen in vaccinated people compared with in unvaccinated people.</p>



<p>“We would be celebrating a seasonal influenza vaccine with 60 percent efficacy,” Jay Butler, the CDC’s deputy director for infectious diseases said January 29 during a news conference sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. (Flu shots are typically around 40 to 60 percent effective.) “While it’s disappointing compared with the 95 percent efficacy from the Phase III clinical trials of the [Pfizer and Moderna] vaccines… it’s still not something that would make me want to not utilize or receive the vaccine myself,” Butler said. </p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>It’s also a single shot, so people don’t need a second vaccination to get full protection. Besides only needing to get jabbed once, that also means less of a logistical hassle to try and set up multiple appointments.</p>



<p>And if the FDA authorizes Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine for emergency use, that would make millions of additional doses available in the United States and help alleviate dose shortages. That could speed up vaccinations and get us back to normal faster.</p>



<h4>I’m vaccinated. Can I spend time with other people?</h4>



<p>Yes, but still with proper precautions for now.</p>



<p>Having highly effective vaccines on hand certainly changes the ways we might evaluate risk, Dean says. But since it’s still unknown what the vaccine might mean for transmission, vaccinated people should follow guidelines like masking up around people who haven’t yet gotten a shot and staying physically distanced. So, for instance, a vaccinated employee should still mask up at work if their colleagues and the people they might encounter aren’t vaccinated yet.</p>



<p>But if all members of a group have been fully vaccinated — and it’s been at least a week after the second dose to let the immune system mount optimal protection — there is some room to be more lenient.</p>



<p>“There are things I would be more willing to do once vaccinated,” Dean says. For her, that means spending time outside with a friend who also has been vaccinated. That equation may be different for others.  </p>



<p>Vaccination status is only one piece of the puzzle. It’s also important to consider how much transmission is happening in the community or how many people others in the group are in contact with, Dean says, since the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective.   </p>



<p>And for now, it’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0128-sc-detects-COVID-variant.html">best to avoid travel</a>, especially with emerging, more contagious variants, the CDC says. One that originated in the United Kingdom is on track to become <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain">the dominant strain</a> in the United States in March (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). And the first two cases of a worrisome South Africa strain were detected in South Carolina on January 28. Neither person had traveled nor had connections with each other, suggesting that variant is already circulating in communities.</p>



<h4>When will researchers figure out if COVID-19 vaccines can stop transmission?</h4>



<p>It’s hard to say.</p>



<p>Some preliminary clinical trial data from Moderna hint that its vaccine might not only protect vaccinated people from developing symptoms, but also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval">prevent infection in general</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/20</em>). If people aren’t getting infected in the first place, then they won’t spread the virus to others. It’s still unclear if that’s the case, however, and clinical trials that could help figure that out are still ongoing, Dean says.</p>



<p>One way that researchers could figure out if vaccinated people are still getting infected but not showing symptoms is by monitoring their blood for immune responses against parts of the virus that aren’t in the vaccine. The primary target of a vaccine-induced <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">immune response</a> is the coronavirus’s spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells <em>(SN: 4/28/20).</em> But if people have antibodies against other parts of the virus, too, it’s a sign that they probably were infected by the real thing.    </p>



<p>Even if the vaccines don’t prevent infection, they might still reduce transmission. Vaccinated people who get infected with the coronavirus may have fewer symptoms or carry less virus in their bodies, for instance. So they might be both less infectious and only able to spread the virus for a shorter time. That would require specialized studies to determine, though.</p>



<p>“It’s pretty easy to see if the vaccine is preventing an infection, so if it’s doing a great job against that then we have our answer,” Dean says. But if a vaccine’s protection falls in-between — curbing transmission but not infection — that will take more time to confirm.    </p>





<h4>What about these new coronavirus variants? Will vaccines protect people from them?</h4>



<p>The vaccines appear to provide some protection. Recent studies have shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">antibodies circulating in the blood can still stop some viral variants</a> from getting into lab-grown cells (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>).</p>



<p>In the lab, antibodies still recognize a coronavirus variant called B.1.1.7 that was first identified in the United Kingdom. Another variant that emerged in South Africa, called 501Y.V2 or B.1.351, appears to pose a tougher challenge for current vaccines, evading some — but not all — antibodies.</p>



<p>Researchers are now getting hints at how that might play out in the real world. While Novavax’s vaccine had an efficacy of 85.6 percent against B.1.1.7 in a clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom, efficacy dropped to 60 percent against B.1.351 in a South Africa clinical trial. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine had 57 percent efficacy in South Africa, but did prevent people there from getting severely ill.  </p>



<p>The emergence of such variants makes it all the more crucial to bring infection levels down, says Stuart Ray, a virologist and infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University. More infections mean more chances for the virus to mutate even more and dodge our defenses.  Multiple vaccine makers — including Novavax, Pfizer and Moderna — are designing new vaccines based on the emerging versions of the coronavirus.</p>



<p>But for now, even with effective vaccines, public health measures like wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowds are still essential tools to help reduce infections and control the pandemic.</p>



<h4>If we still have to wear masks and physically distance, what’s the benefit of getting the shot?</h4>



<p>On a personal level, getting vaccinated make it less likely that you’ll get sick and require hospitalization.</p>



<p>Bigger picture, if fewer people are getting severely ill because they are getting vaccinated and because they continue to wear masks and physically distance, that’s fewer people in the overwhelmed health care systems that are already struggling to take care of severely sick COVID-19 patients.</p>



<p>And eventually, once enough people are vaccinated, hugs, travel and other rituals of normalcy will become less perilous. When is unclear, but every vaccination is a step closer.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-results-variants">One-shot COVID-19 vaccine is effective against severe disease</a></h4>

<p>A single-shot coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson is 85 percent effective at preventing severe disease and death, even against new variants of the virus, the company announced in its interim analysis January 29.</p>



<p>The vaccine didn’t fare as well at preventing more moderate cases of COVID-19, particularly in Latin America and South Africa, where variants that spread more easily have arisen. Depending on location, the shot was only 72 percent to 57 percent effective against moderate to severe bouts of the illness.</p>



<p>Other vaccines, particularly the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval">two mRNA vaccines</a> that have emergency use authorization in the United States, have reported levels of overall efficiency of up to 95 percent against the coronavirus (<em>SN: 12/18/20</em>). That discrepancy could make people reluctant to accept a less effective vaccine, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a Jan. 29 conference call about the results. It shouldn’t, he added.</p>



<p>“If you walk up and say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 to 95 percent [effective vaccine]. Go to the door on the right and get 72 percent.’ What door do you want to go to?’” But what people need to understand, he said, is that real importance of the vaccine is keeping people out of the hospital and preventing the most severe complications of the disease.</p>

<p>That’s what the new vaccine does, Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical division, said during the news conference. “We can prevent COVID, in many cases,” he said. “We can prevent hospitalization. In those that that contract COVID and have moderate disease, [they] have a milder course of disease. Nobody doesn’t benefit from this vaccine.”</p>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine uses a common cold virus — adenovirus 26 — that has been altered so that it can’t replicate in the body to cause disease. The adenovirus ferries instructions for making the coronavirus’s spike protein into human cells. Human cells then make the spike protein, triggering the immune system to produce antibodies and fire up cellular immune defenses from T cells, which attack the coronavirus should it be encountered later.</p>



<p>The company has used this adenovirus system to make an Ebola vaccine as well as still-experimental vaccines against Zika, HIV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Using adenoviruses as carriers, or vectors, has also been used for COVID-19 vaccines made by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">University of Oxford with AstraZeneca</a>, the Canadian-Chinese company <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response">CanSino</a>, and for the Russian <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-russia-vaccine-testing">Sputnik V</a> vaccine (<em>SN: 11/23/20; SN: 7/21/20; SN: 8/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson tested their vaccine in 44,325 adults in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and the United States. Among the participants, 468 cases of COVID-19 arose, the <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial">company</a> and <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/janssen-investigational-covid-19-vaccine-interim-analysis-phase-3-clinical-data-released">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a> each reported in <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/janssen-investigational-covid-19-vaccine-interim-analysis-phase-3-clinical-data-released">news release</a>s.</p>



<p>Deaths occurred in the placebo group, but none in the vaccine group. But the company declined to give specific numbers of cases and deaths in both groups until it files for emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That filing could come next week.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Effectiveness against moderate to severe disease varied by region, ranging from 72 percent in the United States to 66 percent in Latin America to 57 percent in South Africa. Overall, the vaccine is 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe disease. The vaccine was similarly effective in young adults and people 60 and older, and for people with and without underlying health issues, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor">obesity</a>, type 2 diabetes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable">other conditions that increase the risk of complications</a> from COVID-19 (<em>SN: 4/22/20; SN: 3/20/20</em>).</p>



<p>At first glance, the declining effectiveness in Latin America and South Africa might appear discouraging, Mammen said. More transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have been discovered in Brazil and South Africa.</p>



<p>The South Africa variant, known as either 501Y.V2 or B.1.351, has been causing particular concern because of both its increased transmissibility and ability to evade some antibodies that provide protection against the coronavirus. But the vaccine protects against the most severe consequences of the disease even against those variants, Mammen said. “Not a single South African after 28 days post-vaccination ended up needing to go to the hospital. No South African died that was vaccinated.” </p>



<p>The other companies ran their studies at a different stage of the pandemic before the new variants appeared, so the numbers aren’t really comparable, Mammen said. “The pandemic has changed.” Now, “the majority of cases are coming from an evolved set of viruses.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">Novavax</a>, a Gaithersburg, Md.–based company, announced January 28 that its protein-based vaccine prevents illness with 89 percent effectiveness, but was also less effective against the South Africa variant (<em>SN: 1/28/21</em>). The same day, officials in South Carolina announced that two unconnected people with no history of travel had contracted the South Africa variant. That finding probably means the variant is circulating undetected in the state and elsewhere in the country.</p>



<p>Despite lower efficacy, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine has some advantages over the mRNA vaccines. It is given in a single shot instead of two, so it can vaccinate twice as many people with the same number of doses. It needs to be refrigerated, but not <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">frozen</a> the way those vaccines do (<em>SN: 11/20/20</em>). And the vaccine has milder side effects than the already authorized Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Some people had fever, fatigue or pain at the injection site after inoculation, but “the vast majority of people felt nothing at all,” Mammen said.</p>





<p>Other public health officials and scientists point out that the coronavirus vaccines have greater effectiveness than many approved vaccines for other diseases.</p>



<p>“We would be celebrating a seasonal influenza vaccine with 60 percent efficacy,” Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said January 29 during a <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-with-cdc-experts/">news conference</a> sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “While it’s disappointing compared with the 95 percent efficacy from the Phase III trials of the two mRNA vaccines prior to the emergence of these variants, it’s still not something that would make me want to not utilize or receive the vaccine myself.”</p>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson says that it could produce 1 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine — enough to vaccinate about an eighth of the world’s population — by the end of the year. That includes <a href="https://www.jnj.com/our-company/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-in-principle-with-gavi-to-supply-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-to-lower-income-countries-in-2021">100 million doses promised to lower-income countries</a> through the Vaccine Alliance, or Gavi, and the World Health Organization’s COVAX program. The United States has a deal for <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-100-million-doses-of-investigational-covid-19-vaccine">100 million doses</a>, with an option to buy 200 million more doses.</p>



<p>If authorized by the FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world, the vaccine could be an important public health tool, which is crucial as more contagious variants of the virus continue to emerge, experts say. “This virus will continue to evolve and to mutate for certain,” Fauci said. That’s an incentive to use every available safe and effective vaccine available, he said. “The best way to prevent further evolution of a virus is to prevent it from replicating, and you do that by vaccinating people as quickly as you possibly can.”</p>

<p><span id="more-2988"></span></p>
<p><strong>Scientists create a whole-organ 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers in diabetes</strong></p>
<p>Islets are groups of cells in the pancreas that are important for glucose metabolism. Pancreatic islets contain several types of cells, including insulin-producing β cells. Previous studies have shown that islet cells receive dense input from nerve fibers and that this innervation controls blood glucose; thus, elucidating the detailed anatomy of the pancreas in diabetes may provide new insights into metabolic disease. The pancreas, however, is highly heterogeneous and our understanding of its anatomy and function remains incomplete. Here, <a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/stanleylab/meet-the-team/">Dr. Sarah Stanley</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" class="" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and her research team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33036983/">used tissue clearing and whole-organ imaging to create a high-resolution 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers and identified a new mechanism of neural input remodeling in diabetes</a>. Specifically, researchers used the tissue clearing technique iDISCO<sup>+ </sup>and 3D volume imaging and analysis to determine the distribution of β cells, glucagon-producing α cells, and neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200)-positive input fibers in the pancreata of healthy and diabetic mice. NF200 is a neuronal marker that is thought to reflect neural remodeling. They also examined islet and nerve structure in pancreatic tissue from five healthy and three diabetic human donors. Dr. Stanley and her colleagues found that the innervation of the endocrine pancreas was enriched in healthy mice, and innervated islets were larger than non-innervated islets in healthy mice and humans. Islet nerve density and NF200 were increased in the islets of two mouse models of diabetes. Also, nerve density and the proportion of innervated islets was increased in pancreatic tissue from diabetic humans compared to healthy subjects. Researchers also suspected that nerve innervation may change during the development of diabetes. To address this, they used streptozotocin (STZ), a drug that is toxic to β cells, in mice to induce diabetes and found that islet nerve density increased over time compared to control mice. Overall, these findings show that nerve input into islets is maintained in diabetic humans and may be remodeled during disease development. This work constitutes a “3D atlas of pancreatic nerve innervation”, serving as a tool for researchers to quantify β cell mass, define islets, map pancreatic innervation, and assess the interaction between islets and innervation across species. Altogether, this work may help further our understanding of diabetes and lead to novel treatment targets.</p>

<p><strong>Maternal responses to the cries of pups are driven by both innate and plastic mechanisms </strong></p>
<p>The brains of mammals seem to be hardwired to respond to the cries of our infants. However, a virgin mouse will not respond to the cries of another’s pups until she is co-housed with a dam and her litter. This suggests that there may be a re-wiring of the auditory cortex during this experience that enables pup retrieval behavior. But what enables this tuning of the brain to the cries of pups? Here, the lab of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/robert-c-froemke">Dr. Robert Froemke</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" class="" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and his team at New York University recently <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33029014/">demonstrated that after co-housing with pups, cortical plasticity and the oxytocin system rapidly re-tuned neurons in the auditory cortex of virgin mice.</a> The virgin mice also learned to recognize pup cries and retrieve pups. Thus, neural mechanisms triggered by pup experience build upon hard-wired instincts, and drive parenting behavior. In the study, researchers co-housed virgin female mice with a dam and her litter, and then assessed cortical re-tuning. First, they determined the inter-syllable intervals at which females responded to pups and established a library of both prototypical pup calls and morphed calls for later playback procedures. Then, using two-photon imaging and <em>in vivo</em> voltage-clamp recordings, they found that excitatory and inhibitory tuning and synaptic responses were altered by maternal experience. Next, they expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex of virgins and monitored temporal tuning throughout co-housing. This revealed that co-housing results in the coordinated plasticity of neuronal tuning. Finally, the researchers optogenetically inhibited hypothalamic oxytocin neurons of virgin females, co-housed those females with a dam and her litter, during the playback of various pup calls. They found that the oxytocin system is required for the re-tuning of cortical neurons. Altogether, these data demonstrate the importance of central oxytocin in synaptic plasticity processes within the auditory cortex for maternal behavior. Further, this study illustrates how the cortex tunes to the vocalizations of pups. While both experience and innate mechanisms are necessary for the development of maternal behavior, these data provide new insight into how the brain learns maternal skills.

<p><strong>Identification of a new fear circuit from the central amygdala to the globus pallidus</strong></p>
<p>While it has long been known that the amygdala is central to fear and emotional learning, the exact organization and function of its long-range outputs remain elusive. The central amygdala (CeA) is classically thought of as the output zone of the amygdala complex, but how do CeA projections modulate fear learning? Recently, <a href="http://bolilab.labsites.cshl.edu/">Dr. Bo Li</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" class="" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and his team from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and Stanford University sought to answer this question. In their new paper, the researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067362/">showed that the CeA projects to the globus pallidus (GPe) in order to relay information about a stimulus to regulate fear learning</a>. Specifically, they found that a subpopulation of CeA-GPe projections conveys information about the unconditioned stimulus (US) during auditory fear conditioning. During fear conditioning, the US is the electrical foot shock, whereas the stimulus that elicits a fear response (<em>i.e.</em>, freezing behavior) after it is paired with the US (<em>i.e.</em>, a tone) is called the conditioned stimulus. Researchers were interested in the inhibitory somatostatin positive (Sst+) neurons within the CeA and whether their circuitry helps regulate fear learning. To investigate this, Dr. Li’s team used a combination of state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques such as anatomical tract tracing, optogenetic modulation, fiber photometry, <em>in vitro </em>electrophysiology, and fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridization in male and female mice. First, using retrograde cholera toxin B tracers, they confirmed that the CeA sends a subpopulation of neuronal projections to the GPe. Using sophisticated labeling procedures, they next showed that the vast majority of GPe-projecting CeA neurons express Sst.  Anterograde tracing also demonstrated that projections from the CeA to the GPe originate predominantly from Sst+ neurons. Using a tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) viral method, they also showed that blocking neurotransmission within CeA-GPe projections abolished conditioned freezing, indicating that these projections are necessary for fear learning. Fiber photometry revealed that these projections are specifically relaying information about the US during auditory fear conditioning. Further, optogenetically inhibiting or activating GPe-projecting CeA neurons during US presentation blocked or promoted fear learning, respectively, demonstrating that these projections are essential for fear memory formation. Altogether, this team showed that a new CeA-GPe projection is critical for fear memory regulation. These data are critical for characterizing the circuits controlling fear learning-related behaviors, which is an important step toward the development of circuit-based therapeutics following aversive experiences.

<p><strong>The macaque ventrolateral prefrontal cortex boosts inferior temporal cortex population coding to allow rapid object recognition</strong></p>
<p>While the prefrontal cortex has long been known for its role in cognition and emotional processing, it is also critical for visual perception. There is also an emerging role for the inferior temporal cortex (IT) in object discrimination. But how do these two regions interact to enable the recognition of objects? Studying the computational functions within cortical circuits is critical in developing the next generation of models of visual intelligence, which will enable us to understand fundamental behaviors such as object recognition and discrimination. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <a href="http://dicarlolab.mit.edu/">Dr. James DiCarlo</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" class="" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

Their new study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33080226/">illustrates the role of connections between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the primate ventral visual cortex in robust core visual object recognition</a>. Specifically, they were interested in testing whether the vlPFC is an important node in the visual object processing network by pharmacologically inactivating this region and simultaneously recording IT activity with Utah electrode arrays in macaques. They found that reversible, pharmacological inactivation of the vlPFC with muscimol reduced the quality of the IT population code and resulted in deteriorations in object discrimination performance. During the visual discrimination task, this effect of silencing the vlPFC was significantly higher for the late-solved images than for the early-solved images. They also found that inactivation of the vlPFC reduced IT late-phase neuronal population activity. These results suggest that vlPFC is part of a recurrent neural circuit that boosts the performance of the ventral visual processing stream, as opposed to shallow feedforward systems. Studies such as this will one day help to elucidate a complete, mechanistic understanding of visual object recognition, from images to behavior, at the level of the neuron.

<p><strong>Swamp-dweller or landlubber?</strong> – <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/swamp-dweller-or-landlubber">Science News</a></em>, January 30, 1971</p>



<p>Through the years paleontologists have evolved a picture of the appearance and habits of various dinosaurs…. Giant herbivores with long necks and tails, such as the <em>Brontosaurus</em>, have almost invariably been presented as swamp-dwelling semiaquatic animals.… A young Yale University paleontologist, however, now maintains that the anatomy of the <em>Brontosaurus</em> points clearly to a life on land.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Debate over whether <em>Brontosaurus</em> and its fellow sauropods splashed through swamps or ambled over dry land has persisted for decades. In 1971, paleontologist Robert Bakker argued for a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/229172a0">landbound dinosaur</a>, based on the resemblance of its nostrils to those of terrestrial lizards. By the late 1980s, scientists had discovered that sauropods had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/huge-dinosaur-bones-discovered-hollow">hollow bones</a>. That suggested <em>Brontosaurus</em> and its kin were buoyant, though the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/huge-dinosaur-bones-discovered-hollow">finding did not prove the dinos swam</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/89, p. 261</em>). Later studies of pollen and plants preserved near <em>Brontosaurus </em>fossils have shown that the dino stomped through a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0037073804000119">semiarid landscape</a>, no floaties needed.</p>

What do these massive research programs have in common?

We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you.” </blockquote><p><br /> This claim would come back to haunt him in 2019, because (of course) he was nowhere close to simulating a human brain. In his defense, Markram said that his critics <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/748" target="_blank">misunderstood</a> and misinterpreted his grandiose proclamations.<sup><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></sup>  </p><p>Blue Brain is now <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/">aimed at</a> “biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain.” <br /><br /> </p><p><b><i>In Silico</i></b></p><p>Documentary filmmaker <a href="http://www.noahhutton.com/" target="_blank">Noah Hutton</a><sup><span style="color: #800180;">2</span> </sup>undertook his own 10 year project that followed Markram and colleagues as they worked towards the goals of Blue Brain. He was motivated by <i><b>that</b></i> TED talk and its enthralling prediction of a brain in a supercomputer (hence <i>in silico</i>). Originally entitled <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bluebrain-documentary-premiere/" target="_blank"><i>Bluebrain</i></a> and focused on Markram, the documentary evolved over time to include more realistic viewpoints and interviews with skeptical scientists, including Anne Churchland, Terry Sejnowski, Stanislas Dehaene, and Cori Bargmann. Ironically, Sebastian Seung was one of the loudest critics (ironic because Seung has a grandiose TED talk of his own, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome" target="_blank">I Am My Connectome</a>).<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>      </p><p> </p><p><i><a href="https://insilicofilm.com" target="_blank">In Silico</a></i> was available for streaming during the <a href="https://www.docnyc.net/film/in-silico/" target="_blank">DOC NYC</a> Festival in November (in the US only), and I had the opportunity to watch it. I was impressed by the motivation and dedication required to complete such a lengthy project.  Hutton had gathered so much footage that he could have made multiple movies from different perspectives.</p><p>Over the course of the film, Blue Brain/Human Brain blew up, with ample critiques and a signed petition from <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/updated-european-neuroscientists-revolt-against-eus-human-brain-project" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of neuroscientists (see archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140710070144/http://www.neurofuture.eu:80/" target="_blank">Open Letter</a>). <br /></p><p>And  Hutton grew up. He reflects on the process (and how he changed) at the end of film. He was only 22 at the start, and 10 years is a long time at any age. </p><p></p><p>Some of the Big Questions in <i><a href="https://insilicofilm.com" target="_blank">In Silico</a></i>:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>How do you make sure all this lovely simulated activity would be relevant for an animal's behavior?</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>How do you build in biological imperfections (noise) or introduce chaos into your perfect pristine computational model? “Tiny mistakes” are critical for adaptable biological systems.</li></ul><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>“You cannot play the same soccer game again,” said one of the critics (Terry Sejnowski, I think)</li></ul><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>“What is a generic brain?”</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>What is the vision? </li></ul><p>The timeline kept drifting further and further into the future.

One is a  fantastic, sober scientist … the other is a PR-minded messiah.”</p><p>Koch is Chief Scientist of the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/news-press/press-releases/allen-institute-announces-new-phase-neuroscience-research" target="_blank">MindScope Program</a> at the  Allen Institute for Brain Science, which focuses on how neural circuits produce vision. Another major unit is the Cell Types Program, which (as advertised) focuses on brain cell types and connectivity.<sup><span style="color: #800180;">3</span></sup> </p><p>The Allen Institute <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/" target="_blank">core principles</a> are team science, Big Science, and open science. An impressive recent paper by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X" target="_blank">Gouwens and 97 colleagues (2020</a>) is a prime example of all three.

<p>“It’s the first evidence of a full additional copy of the mitochondrial genome in a vertebrate,” says Chris Schneider, a herpetologist at Boston University not involved in the study.  Other vertebrates have only one copy of a mitochondrial genome. Mussels are the only other animal ever found to have two.</p>



<p>Mitochondria are tiny energy factories, and their genetic material is usually important in building the structures and keeping them running. Recent studies show that mitochondrial DNA plays major roles in aging and various human cancers, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cloning-method-targets-mitochondrial-diseases">metabolic, muscular and neurogenerative diseases</a> (<em>SN: 10/24/12</em>). Studying the mitochondrial genomes of other animals could offer clues to the inner workings of human disease, the researchers say.</p>





<p> “The mitochondrial genome is much more important than people realize, given its association with aging and disease,” says Robert Macey, a genomicist at the Peralta Genomics Institute in Oakland, Calif. “How that operates in an animal that ages slowly in a cool environment might tell us something significant about how mitochondria work.”</p>



<p>Efforts to decode the tuatara’s genetic makeup began in 2012, with the launch of the <a href="http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/centres-research/allan-wilson-centre/our-research/strategic-initiatives/the-tuatara-genome-project.cfm">Tuatara Genome Project</a> led by Neil Gemmell, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. After getting the blessing of the Maori people to sample the reptile’s blood (tuatara are a <em>taonga</em> (special treasure) to the Maori), the team found the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuataras-rare-reptiles-genes-longevity-cool-weather">its genome to be 50 percent larger than the human genome</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>).</p>



<p>This discovery led to deeper exploration of the mitochondrial part of the genome. Most techniques that decipher, or sequence, DNA chop it into small pieces, “read” it, then reassemble the pieces. That provides a high resolution look at individual puzzle pieces. Piloting a new technique that reads long DNA segments, Macey’s lab sequenced the tuatara’s mitochondrial genome in one fell swoop, showing its overall structure. The technique, called long-read sequencing, “is undoubtedly the future of gene sequencing, that we can sequence whole molecules in one pop!” Macey says.</p>



<p>Dan Mulcahy, a molecular biologist at the Smithsonian’s <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/global-genome-initiative" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Global Genome Initiative</a> in Washington, D.C., and Macey were mulling over the data when Mulcahy recalls saying, “I think there may be two mt-genomes!” </p>



<p>The revelation came from comparing both the chopped puzzle pieces and the overall structure, and noticing that sections from the same part of the mitochondrial DNA had striking differences in their gene sequences — like the way the notes of song might be arranged differently by two different composers. The variation raised eyebrows; mitochondrial DNA is usually inherited only from a mother’s egg, so the scientists expected to see a single copy of the mitochondrial genome, not two copies like they would see in nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both mother and father.</p>



<p>Together, the scientists painstakingly assembled two fully functional mitochondrial genomes. They found the genomes differed by an eye-popping 10.4 percent. In comparison, human and chimpanzee mitochondrial genomes differ by 8.9 percent. “The tuatara’s arrangement of genes is unlike any other vertebrate,” Mulcahy says.</p>



<p>When Lara Urban, a genomicist at the University of Otago, analyzed which sets of genes differed between the two genomes, she noticed changes in ones related to metabolism. An animal’s cell metabolism adjusts to help it cope with environmental extremes. The double mitochondrial genome might give tuatara flexibility in how their metabolisms respond to temperature extremes, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“The tuatara has the most complicated mitochondrial genome I’ve ever seen,” Macey says. Finding the genetic basis for the animal’s metabolic feats could clarify the mitochondrial genome’s function, helping to find treatments for human metabolic diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine is effective, but less so with some variants</a></h4>

<p>A COVID-19 vaccine made by Novavax is about 89 percent effective against illness, but doesn’t protect as well against a virus variant that arose in South Africa. The data also suggest that people who previously had coronavirus infections may not be immune to the South Africa variant, known as 501Y.V2 or B.1.351, which is now circulating in at least 30 countries.</p>



<p>The results came the same day that health officials reported the <a href="https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/south-carolina-public-health-officials-detect-nations-first-known-cases-covid-19">first two U.S. cases of COVID-19 caused by the South Africa variant</a>. It turned up in two people in separate parts of South Carolina with no connection to each other. Neither had traveled recently, so it’s unclear where they picked up the virus. </p>



<p>Novavax Inc., based in Gaithersburg, Md., presented the interim data from clinical trials in South Africa and the United Kingdom in a <a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3">news release</a> January 28. The studies are not yet complete and final effectiveness data are expected in February. The company is also conducting a large trial in the United States and Mexico for which data are not yet available.</p>



<p>Novavax’s vaccine, given in two shots 21 days apart, contains a rod-shaped nanoparticle studded with the coronavirus’s spike protein. It is the first protein-based COVID-19 vaccine for which there are effectiveness results. That signature protein prompts the body to recognize and make antibodies against the virus, setting up the tools to fight a later infection.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the company did a Phase III clinical trial to test the vaccine’s efficacy against a placebo in more than 15,000 people. Of the 62 cases of COVID-19 that arose among study participants, 56 were in the placebo group and six in the vaccine group. Most cases were mild or moderate. One severe case occurred in the placebo group.</p>



<p>Those data indicate that the vaccine protects against severe illness with 89.3 percent effectiveness. The vaccine protected nearly as well — with 85.6 percent effectiveness — against illness from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread">more transmissible variant</a> of the virus known as B.1.1.7 that has become prominent in the United Kingdom (<em>SN: 12/22/20</em>). In the United States, that strain has also been detected in more than half of the states and may become the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain">dominant strain by March</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>).</p>



<p>The South African trial included about 4,400 adults. As the trial got started, a variant of the coronavirus called 501Y.V2 became the predominant variant in the country. That variant is of concern because some evidence suggests it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">can escape antibodies</a> that prevent the virus from entering cells (<em>SN: 1/27/20</em>).</p>



<p>In the preliminary analysis of the South African trial, 44 participants got COVID-19. Of those, 29 — including the sole severe case — were in the placebo group and 15 were in the vaccine group.  The vaccine showed 60 percent efficacy at preventing severe COVID-19 in people who are HIV-negative. When HIV-positive people were added to equation, the vaccine was 49.4 percent effective at preventing disease.</p>

</aside>



<p>Researchers have determined the genetic makeup of the virus in 27 of the 44 cases in the study. The 501Y.V2 variant accounted for 25 of those 27 cases, or 92.6 percent.</p>



<p>About a third of the participants had antibodies in their blood at the start of the study indicating that they’d had previous infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But those previous infections didn’t protect against the new variant.</p>



<p>“The wave one illness experience is not providing immunity to wave two,” Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax said January 28 during a conference call with investors.</p>



<p>Still, the company is encouraged that the vaccine showed some protection against the variant, Glenn said. Other companies are testing whether their vaccines can also head off illness caused by the new variant.</p>



<p>Novavax already has new versions of its vaccine, including one that includes the 501Y.V2 variant, in development and expects to start clinical trials in the second quarter of 2021, Glenn said.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-mole-rat-colonies-speak-communicate-unique-dialects">Naked mole-rat colonies speak with unique dialects</a></h4>

<p>When one naked mole-rat encounters another, the accent of their chirps might reveal whether they’re friends or foes.</p>



<p>These social rodents are famous for their wrinkly, hairless appearance. But hang around one of their colonies for a while, and you’ll notice something else — they’re a chatty bunch. Their underground burrows resound with near-constant chirps, grunts, squeaks and squeals.</p>



<p>Now, computer algorithms have uncovered <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6528/503">a hidden order within this cacophony</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 29 <em>Science</em>. These distinctive chirps, which pups learn when they’re young, help the mostly blind, xenophobic rodents discern who belongs, strengthening the bonds that maintain cohesion in these highly cooperative groups.</p>



<p>“Language is really important for extreme social behavior, in humans, dolphins, elephants or birds,” says Thomas Park, a biologist at the University of Illinois Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study. This work shows naked mole-rats (<em>Heterocephalus glaber</em>) belong in those ranks as well, Park says.</p>





<p>Naked mole-rat groups seem more like ant or termite colonies than mammalian societies. Every colony has a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-mammal-joins-eusocial-club">single breeding queen who suppresses the reproduction</a> of tens to hundreds of nonbreeding worker rats that dig elaborate subterranean tunnels in search of tubers in eastern Africa (<em>SN: 10/18/04</em>). Food is scarce, and the rodents vigorously attack intruders from other colonies. While researchers have long noted the rat’s raucous chatter, few actually studied it. </p>



<p>“Naked mole-rats are incredibly cooperative and incredibly vocal, and no one has really looked into how these two features influence one another,” says Alison Barker, a neuroscientist at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin.</p>



<p>To start, she and her colleagues leveraged the computing power of machine learning to analyze over 30,000 “soft chirps” — a common vocalization — from seven laboratory colonies over two years. The analysis revealed that each colony had a unique sound, varying primarily in frequency and how much that frequency changes within a single chirp.</p>



<p>Naked mole-rats pick up on these differences too, replying to the sounds of their own colony with frequent chirping, but largely ignoring foreign dialects, the researchers found. “That surprised us, and suggests soft chirps might signal that a naked mole-rat belongs to the colony,” Barker says. The naked mole-rats aren’t just responding to voices they’ve heard before either, as artificially concocted calls matched to a specific dialect also elicited a response.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Mole-rat greeting</h3>



<p>Naked mole-rats often greet each other with a soft chirp, which can be used to communicate individual and colony identity. Different colonies have distinctive dialects, often varying in frequency, as can be heard by comparing these soft chirps from two separate colonies.</p>

<p>A bit of luck allowed Barker and her colleagues to test whether these dialects are learned or genetically encoded. Most colonies reject outsiders, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-mole-rats-colonies-territory-pups">sometimes pups from other groups can get adopted by a colony</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/20</em>). Multiple laboratory populations produced new litters around the same time, allowing the researchers to switch three youngsters to new colonies. If dialect stems from genetics, these outsiders should still sound like outsiders. But if dialects are learned, transplanted pups should sound like their new brethren.</p>



<p>The latter was true. And the closer to birth a pup was moved, the more closely it matched the dialect of its new home. </p>



<p>“A sample size of three is small, but these are really difficult experiments to do,” says Chris Faulkes, an evolutionary biologist at Queen Mary University of London who wasn’t involved in the study. Still, he says the results strongly suggest that dialects of naked mole-rats are learned, similar to those of humans, cetaceans and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-throated-sparrow-song-variation">some birds</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/20</em>).</p>



<p>While a colony’s sound is distinctive, it’s not fixed. In periods of anarchy — when a queen dies and is not yet replaced — dialects started to dissolve, becoming much more variable, the researchers found. Once a new queen emerged, the colony cohered again, suggesting that in addition to suppressing reproduction, queens also somehow control a colony’s voice.</p>



<p>Dialects probably play a role in maintaining the “exquisite cooperation” of naked mole-rat societies, Barker says. But they also reflect how vocal communication is another means by which queens suppress the individual interests of colony members for the good of the group.</p>



<p>“We tend to think of this communication and cooperation as positive aspects of naked mole-rat culture, but individuals are rigidly controlled in their behavior by the queen,” Barker says. “It gives them a huge survival advantage, but it’s a bit like living in an oppressive regime.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>At the start of a new year it’s customary to look forward, imagining what we might want to achieve in the months to come. It’s what lies at the heart of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/">New Year’s resolutions</a>: they may be maligned for their persistent failure to stick, but do at least represent a great degree of hope for the future — a hope to become fitter or more productive, or to learn something new. </p>



<p>In the current circumstances hope is certainly in short supply. But if you <em>can</em> manage to stay hopeful you might be able to avoid risk-taking behaviours like drinking, taking drugs, gambling or overeating, argues a new <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09989-4">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Gambling Studies</em> from Shahriar Keshavarz and team at the University of East Anglia.</p>



<p>The study focuses specifically on “relative deprivation” — the belief that your lot in life is somehow worse than other people’s. Previous research has suggested that those who score highly on feelings of relative deprivation are more likely to engage in “maladaptive escape behaviours” including risk-taking. But hope could ameliorate such behaviour, the team argues, protecting people from potential harm.</p>



<span id="more-41249"></span>



<p>In the first study, 51 participants started by filling in two measures. One looked at hope, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements related to goal-directed energy (“I energetically pursue my goals”) and alternate routes to success (“I can think of many ways to get out of a jam”). The second looked at relative deprivation — how deprived or privileged participants felt compared to other people.</p>



<p>Next, the participants took part in a risk-taking task. They saw an animated cannon, which could fire balls that land anywhere between 0 and 100 metres away, and were asked to bet on where they thought the ball would land. When selecting the distance, participants had three options: a high risk option, which let them cover a five metre range (e.g. the ball landing between 20 and 25 metres away), a medium risk option, which offered a ten metre range (e.g. 20 and 30 metres) and a low risk option (e.g. 20 to 40 metres). The higher the risk, the more money participants could win.</p>



<p>Participants who felt relatively deprived showed an inverse relationship between goal-directed energy and risk-taking. That is, among this group risk-taking was lower for those who had a greater sense of “hope” in the form of directing energy towards achieving their goals. (Those who felt relatively privileged showed the opposite pattern, with risk taking increasing among those with greater hope).</p>



<p>In the second study, 50 participants again filled in measures related to hope and relative deprivation, before being shown their position on a (fake) “Comparative Discretionary Income” index, showing how deprived or privileged they were compared to others based on their income. Some participants were shown a score that indicated they were deprived, while others were told they were comparatively privileged. They then completed the risk-taking measure from the first experiment.</p>



<p>The team found that inducing people to feel deprived led them to take more risks — but again, those who reported more feelings of hope regarding their goals took less risks than those with low levels of hope.  This suggests hope for the future may act as a protective factor against risk-taking in those who feel relatively deprived. Relatively privileged participants again showed the opposite pattern, with hope increasing risk taking.</p>



<p>The final study looked at 122 participants who had gambled at least once in the last year. Participants completed the hope and relative deprivation scales, as well as an index measuring how severe their gambling was on a scale from one (no problem) to four (problem gambling). Results from this measure suggested that 27% of participants had no gambling problems, 26% had low levels of problems, 38% had moderate problems and 9% were problem gamblers with possible loss of control.</p>



<p>As in the previous studies, among participants who reported being relatively deprived, those who showed more goal-directed energy were less likely to have problems with gambling. There was no relationship between hope and gambling severity amongst those who felt relatively privileged.</p>



<p>Hope may therefore be a vital tool for those experiencing difficulties in their life, buffering against risky or potentially harmful behaviours like gambling, drinking or drug-taking. The team posits that those who feel relatively deprived engage in risky behaviours in order to allay or sublimate negative feeling; understanding the importance of hope in such a situation may be a good start in developing behavioural interventions.</p>



<p>It can be difficult to feel satisfied with what you’ve got, especially if those around you appear to be thriving financially, socially or romantically. Looking for ways out of your situation, energetically pursuing goals and thinking of new solutions to problems may not solve all of your problems — but it could make the temptations of risk-taking easier to deal with.</p>

<p>What is science? It is somewhat frustrating for a scientist to not be able to answer this question precisely. Yet it is a very important question, in particular in the public debate. For example, how are we to convince people to listen to science if we cannot explain what is special about science? What makes science better than the opinion of any given person or institution?</p>
<p>Naturally, this has been a central question in philosophy of science. For a while, it was thought that science is characterized by a particular method, a set of rules that one can follow to produce new truths about the world. This is impossible, because for any finite set of observations, there is an infinite number of general propositions that agree with those observations. Then came Karl Popper: he proposed that a scientific proposition is a proposition that can in principle be falsified, that is, such that there exists a statement that would logically contradict it (whether it is actually true or not). For example, “all penguins are black” can be contradicted by the statement “this is a blue penguin”. Popper’s motivation was to distinguish between science and pseudo-science or religious discourse. For example, it is not possible to contradict the existence of God because any fact can be interpreted as what God wants.</p>
<p>Although still very popular today, in particular among biologists, falsifiability has been heavily criticized. There are several fatal shortcomings in this idea. A simple one is that it tends to classify pseudo-sciences as sciences, for a simple reason: they can be falsified because they actually have been falsified. So the criterion is not sufficient. Other arguments show that it is not necessary (or meaningful) either.</p>
<p>Other analyses have shown that methods used by scientists are rather flexible both historically and, more importantly, across disciplines. Physicists do not use double-blind tests with control groups. Paleontologists do not produce empirical knowledge by experimentation. So if there is a scientific method, then which one is it? It is not that there is no scientific method. Rather, scientific methods are objects of scientific activity (things that scientists develop, use and discuss) rather than definitions of it.</p>
<p>Paul Hoyningen-Huene proposes a new theory of the nature of science, called systematicity theory, which brings some interesting ideas to this question. It is published in a <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199985050.001.0001/acprof-9780199985050">recent book</a>, and formerly <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-007-9100-x">in a short article</a>. First, the original angle is that instead of comparing science with pseudo-science, he compares science with everyday knowledge. With this perspective, it becomes clear that there is something special about not just natural sciences, but essentially all academic fields including human sciences. History, for example, is distinctly more scientific than anecdotes that you could tell at dinner.</p>
<p>The main thesis is that what characterizes science is that is more <em>systematic</em> than non-science (on a similar subject). This idea of systematicity is developed in several dimensions. It must be noted that his goal is descriptive, nor normative.</p>
<p>For example, scientific descriptions tend to be systematic, e.g. with taxonomy, axiomatization, periodization (for history). Take the recent <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/452">discovery of actin rings in the axon</a> of neurons thanks to super-resolution microscopy. This is purely descriptive. Is it not science because it is not a test of a theory, maybe on the epistemic level of a news article? No, it is clearly science: it is part of an effort to systematically describe what a cell is made of. Writing the state of the art in a thesis, for example, is an exercise to systematically cover everything relevant about a particular subject, and it is an important skill that a scientist must acquire. Not crediting and referencing a relevant study is considered a professional error.</p>
<p>A particularly important dimension of systematicity is the defense of knowledge claims, that is, the way scientific claims are backed up. In mathematics, for example, there is the formal proof, a systematic way of demonstrating the validity of a claim. In other sciences, one may try to systematically consider and rule out alternative interpretations. All sciences develop field-specific methods to avoid errors. It is not that there is a method that is guaranteed to produce truths. Rather, there is an effort in each discipline to systematically develop ways of tracking errors. This includes social practices, such as peer review. In peer review, the author must systematically address all contradictions raised by a reviewer.</p>
<p>The book addresses many other aspects. It is not a particularly entertaining book, in fact I suspect that the author has made a particular effort to be systematic in his treatment of the subject. But the thesis is interesting because it covers many distinctive aspects of science that are usually not reported when discussing the nature of science. It also gives a more satisfying account of how science differs from pseudo-science. Pseudo-science is typically selective rather than systematic: claims are supported by a careful selection of evidence; objections are dismissed rather than systematically rebutted.</p>
<p>Although the thesis is not meant to be normative, I think it provides an interesting perspective on several aspects of modern science that are currently discussed, and which are also relevant to the politics of science. I will briefly discuss two.</p>
<p>One is the spread of scientific story-telling. In so-called “high-profile” journals, in particular in biology, there is considerable pressure to present a “good story”, something that is coherent, appealing, entertaining. And as publishing in those journals basically determines whether you can remain a working scientist, this is considerable pressure on all scientists. A scientist must also be a good communicator, story-telling advocates say. Obviously, it is better to have a well-written paper than a poorly written paper. Yes, but everything else being equal. Here unfortunately making a good story means selecting and ordering results so as to construct a coherent narrative, while dismissing every observation, remark, or previous study, which weakens or confuses the narrative. This clearly goes against systematicity. What then distinguishes such scientific “stories” from pseudo-scientific claims misleadingly backed up by carefully selected facts? It seems clear that systematically acknowledging all facts and interpretations that are not in line with the thesis of the authors, or simply that require specific explanations, is critically important in a scientific study. Yes, it might make the paper less entertaining and exciting. But that should not be the primary goal: the primary goal a scientific paper is a systematic report on a study. Developing scientific writing skills does not necessarily mean making up stories.</p>
<p>Another and related aspect is the idea, in particular in the research funding system, that good science must be disruptive, paradigm-shifting - only innovative ideas must be funded. Yes, because it is better to do ground-breaking science than ground-scratching science. This is the key principle of the ERC, for example. But again, this is not what science is about. This might be what product development is about (not even sure about that). But science is about systematically consolidating, expanding and connecting existing pieces of knowledge. Occasionally extraordinary discoveries are made, or new fields emerge. But that is nowhere near the core of science, which relies on systematic, rigorous examination. Without this, what we are left with is a bunch of TED talks - entertaining, occasionally informing, but you cannot learn to build rockets by watching TED talks.</p>
<p>I do not think that systematicity theory exhausts the question, however. What seems missing, in particular, is that science is about telling truths about the world. Science is a systematic activity, but not any activity: it is an activity whose goal is to document truths about the world. This means that being a scientist is not just following some practices, but also making an ethical commitment: a commitment to an ideal of truth. This is in my view a critical point when discussing the politics of science - how science should be organized, evaluated, communicated.</p>
<p>While it certainly does not exhaust the subject, what is satisfying about Hoyningen-Huene’s book is that, while it is lucid enough to acknowledge that there is no universal scientific method, it still convincingly argues that there is something special about science, something that may be worthwhile.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/disease-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Implementation Science is a growing field that seeks to accelerate the science into real world practice, an event that can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241518/">often times take 17 years to achieve.</a> While we are exploring the factors that affect the translation of science, we also need to understand why ineffective practices continue to persist and why effective practices are ended. This is what the study of mis-implementation seeks to answer. In particular, in the United States, it is estimated that only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18287919/">60% of public health practices are actually evidence based</a>. That leaves the question about what is happening with the other 40% of practices.</p>
<p>In our research published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, our team conducted a national survey of state health department chronic disease employees to gather more information on how often they felt mis-implementation was occurring in their departments and what could be the possible factors that affect these types of decisions. As the United States has witnessed in the past year, State Health departments are significant drivers of public health interventions. Chronic Diseases are considered a considerable risk factor for cancer and it is estimated that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fundingprofiles/">$1.1 billion is annually expended to state cancer control and chronic disease prevention programs</a>. But despite this large number, a small amount of that is actually used towards primary prevention programs such as physical activity and nutritional intervention programs. Given the scarce resources available, it is crucial to know that every dollar is being used towards the most effective and wide-reaching programs. And unfortunately, that may not always be the case.</p>
<blockquote><p>50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued.</p></blockquote>
<p>From our national survey, we found that 50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming reason being funding priorities changed or ended. State Health Department funding is based heavily on time limited grants and it’s not always guaranteed that a successful program will continue to see its funding continue. This is consistent with the literature around evidence-based decision making that <a href="https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-018-0717-x">engaging with policymakers around programming funding can enhance the sustainment of evidence based programs.</a></p>
<p>On the flip side of the mis-implementation coin, 48.5% of state health department employees stated that sometimes, often or always continued programs that should have ended. While funding was still a prominent factor with inappropriately continued programs, policymakers and agency leadership were also significant factors in this decision making outcome.</p>
<blockquote><p>Leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked further about factors that affect these outcomes, participants revealed that organizational &amp; agency factors have a significant influence. Most significant is that too many organizational layers in a state health agency can impede decision-making. Also leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes. Organizational capacity can be a major influence in the success of a programs outcomes. It is simply not enough to have an effective public health program. We also need public health agencies that have the organizational capacity to deliver them effectively and understand when programs should not be continued.</p>
<p>The study team is continuing to build on this initial data by conducting qualitative case studies to highlight the mis-implementation challenges and success that state agencies have been met with in implementing these programs. The team has also partnered with a group at the Brookings Institute to create agent-based models that can help further describe and highlight how these decision-making processes play out in state agencies. These models can eventually be a tool for facilitating better decision-making in the eventual hope that it helps decrease the prevalence of mis-implementation in state health department chronic disease programs.</p>
<p>There is still much to learn about mis-implementation and how implementation science can improve our public health systems. Our study is one of the firsts to really identify these factors across state public health agencies in the United States. We hope that lessons learned from this study can eventually contributed to improved chronic disease health outcomes locally, nationally and globally.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>“Two boats are sinking and you can save only one. One holds two dogs, the other a person. Which do you save? If you’re not sure, you can say, ‘I can’t decide.’” When I put this to my 11-year-old, his response was immediate: “Save the dogs!” In his defence, he has grown up with a pet dog, which he adores — and, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398">a new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, most other kids would say the same thing.</p>



<p>To adults, these findings might seem a little alarming. Indeed, when the team put similar questions (varying the numbers of dogs, pigs and people) to adult participants, 61% opted to save one human over 100 dogs (which does mean of course that nearly 40% didn’t), and 85% of people prioritised one human over one dog, while 93% opted to save a human rather than a single pig (3% went for the pig).</p>



<p>When the team asked 249 kids aged between five and nine about what they thought, though, they found that just over 70% opted to let a person die to save 100 dogs. When it came to one human vs one dog, only about a third of the children opted to save the person, 28% were clear on going for the dog, and the rest couldn’t decide.</p>



<span id="more-41239"></span>



<p>When pigs, rather than dogs, were pitted against people, the children’s responses were also revealing. Of course, pigs are not generally kept as pets, but for many of these urban, US-based kids (whose religion, if any, was not ascertained), are rather sources of food. And yet only 57% prioritised one human over one pig, and 18% reported that they’d save the pig. The child’s age had no impact — the 9-year-olds made the same judgements as the 5-year-olds. However, both kids and adults who had regular exposure to dogs showed less of bias in favour of people over dogs; for the kids, this also extended to a lower bias in favour of people over pigs.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study of fresh groups of adult and child participants, the team kept the same varying human vs dog or pig ratios but altered the question to ask what “Mr X”, who “always does the right thing” would do. They did this to be very clear that they were asking for moral judgements. The results were very similar to those from the first study.</p>



<p>In the first study, the team had also asked the adults and kids to rate humans’, dogs’ and pigs’ intelligence and also capacity to feel pain, sadness and fear. Both adults and kids gave similar ratings for all three species, and agreed that people scored higher on these counts than dogs, who scored higher than pigs. “Yet despite this,” the team notes, “children and adults gave different moral judgements, which suggests that perceived intelligence and sentience does not fully account for moral judgements.”</p>



<p>So why do adults have a much stronger pro-human bias? The team suspect that this is something that is learned relatively late in childhood. “Adolescents may learn and internalise the socially held speciesist notion — or ideology — that humans are morally special and deserve full moral status, whereas animals do not,” they write.</p>



<p>They do note, however, that their groups of US-based, primarily white, English-speaking participants from mostly urban areas is not exactly globally representative. It would be interesting, of course, to explore whether kids who grow up on farms, say, have different ideas about the relative importance of particular animals vs humans. </p>



<p>Given my son’s (not unexpected) reaction to the dog vs people questions, the findings on kids are a little reassuring: he’s not unusual in feeling that way. I’m fairly sure, though, that if I’d got more personal, and asked him to choose between saving his younger brother or Dottie, our dog, he’d have gone for his brother, if only for my sake… I can tell him that he’s less “speciesist” than me, at least.</p>

<p>Knitting thick yarn is exponentially quicker than thin yarn, so I am already approaching done. Gunhild is knitted, steek-ed, and has edgings – just a soak, then blocking (persuading the knit fabric to reach its final intended shape).</p>



<p>There was one major setback on the way – I ran out of the main colour yarn after adding some much needed bust space. And so, it turns out, had every yarn store on the continent. That particular burnt orange nuance was backlisted months in 50 different yarn stores. I should in retrospect of course have gotten an extra ball of yarn of each color; I only got an extra ball of the gray contrast yarn. So this Gunhild is unique, with contrast coloured half sleeves, and slightly different edging.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Whatever your political affiliation, making appeals to people’s morality can be a powerful rhetorical tool. Politicians frequently use language that refers to moral principles of harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity, in order to defend policy positions, appeal to new voters and appease old ones. And it’s an approach that seems to work. Research suggests that people are far more likely to take action once they connect a particular issue with their own moral or ethical convictions — even to the point of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00254.x">committing acts of violence</a>.</p>



<p>But how and when politicians use moral language shifts with changes in the political landscape, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397">a new study</a> from the University of Toronto’s Sze-Yuh Nina Wang and Yoel Inbar, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>. Looking at Democrat and Republican politicians in the US, they found that moral language increased as political power <em>decreased, </em>suggesting that its use is not fixed. </p>



<span id="more-41228"></span>



<p>The first study looked at public tweets posted by members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; some, like Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, had millions of followers, while others had thousands. Using a text-analysis technique, the team coded nearly 700,000 tweets posted between January 2016 and January 2018 from 578 politicians in Congress (385,206 from Democrats and 302,154 from Republicans).</p>



<p>The team focused on five moral foundations — harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity — and their positive and negative aspects (“virtues” and “vices”). For the analysis, the tweets were compared to a dictionary containing words related to each virtue and vice, to see how close the language in each tweet was to these words. </p>



<p>Overall, Democrats used moral language more frequently than Republicans. And while moral language was used more by both parties after the 2016 Presidential election, this increase was greater for Democrats, who were more likely to go on using moral language. This was also the case for those moral foundations more traditionally associated with Republicans (loyalty, authority and purity).</p>



<p>A second study looked at transcripts of all debates and proceedings in Congress between 1981 and 2017, utilising the same text-analysis technique as in the first study. In both the House and the Senate, the minority party was far more likely to use moral language related to almost all of the foundations (a notable exception was language related to authority, which was sometimes used more frequently by the majority party).</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that the use of moral language is dynamic rather than static, and likely to change over time depending on context. This makes sense — moral language is often ramped up during national crises, perhaps because there is more at stake.</p>



<p>Future research could look at what subjects are being discussed using moral language — is it being used on specific issues, or more broadly to condemn the opposing party? <em>Who</em> is using such language also seems relevant. There are a huge range of divergent views even within a political party itself — a left wing politician like Bernie Sanders or Ilhan Omar is unlikely to share the exact moral values of the more centrist Nancy Pelosi, for example, even though they all belong to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2016/1/25/egypt-revolution-18-days-of-people-power">masses marched to Midan Tahrir</a> in Cairo, triggering a protest movement that resulted in the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. “People are fed up of Mubarak and of his dictatorship and of his torture chambers and of his failed economic policies,” an <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/1/26/three-dead-in-egypt-protests">Egyptian blogger told al-Jazeera</a> at the time: “If Mubarak is not overthrown tomorrow then it will be the day after. If it’s not the day after it’s going to be next week.”</p><p>Ten years later, Mubarak is gone, but the country remains under the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/egypt-constitution/">tight grip of a military leader</a>, who recently extended his rule until 2030. Since April 2017, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has upheld a state of emergency which provides his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4f334481cb12c1acadc57623/t/589d8f9f37c5811653d89cd4/1486720954695/2016+Report+English.pdf">security forces, known to terrorize political opponents and ordinary citizens</a>, with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/egypt">unchecked power</a>. In 2019, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/24/egypt-new-ngo-law-renews-draconian-restrictions">Human Rights Watch reported</a> that 2,000 independent organizations have been shut down, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/2/9/egypt-shuts-el-nadeem-centre-for-torture-victims">including the Nadeem Centre for victims of torture and violence</a>. In December 2020, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0427_EN.html">EU warned that the human rights situation in Egypt had deteriorated sharply</a> over the last year, citing the arbitrary detainment of 4,000 citizens, imprisonment of 60,000 people on political grounds, the systematic enforced disappearance of political opponents, grave violations to the right to  life, and more.</p><p>In this climate, could we expect new mass protests to mark the ten-year anniversary of the Arab Spring? Based on interviews with participants and non-participants in the 2011 Egyptian and Moroccan uprisings, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://t.co/Sd3yRjdUoi?amp=1">new research</a> investigates the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/data.php">cognitive processes</a> underlying the protests. The findings show that individuals joined the uprisings based on hot, positive emotions, which translated into protest decision with great speed. In contrast, decisions to stay at home were based on slow and cool reasoning processes focused on individual safety.</p><p>Safety considerations were so strong that they encouraged large numbers of people to abstain from the Arab Spring even if individuals approved of the protests and rejected the ruling regime. In the words of a non-participant: “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/files/cogs.12762.pdf">When people are killed, we must be careful. There are more important things than protest: safety and stability</a>.” On the other hand, positive emotions of courage to face the government, hope that protest would succeed, solidarity with other protestors, and national pride were major contributors to the Arab Spring. These emotions were themselves triggered by the successful mass uprisings in Tunisia, unprecedented numbers of protest at home, and fellow citizens sacrificing their lives to face violent state authorities.</p><p>The current situation does not display these emotional triggers, but countless grounds for safety concerns. Nevertheless, hot cognition and emotion-based reasoning <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557">happen fast</a>, and researchers have observed that mass protests take off very suddenly, so that they “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~public.econ.duke.edu/~tk43/abstracts/articles/ab_article_18A.htm">will unavoidably continue to catch the world by surprise</a>.” When Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, nobody would have anticipated the subsequent Arab Spring. Similar triggers will occur in the Arab world, with the potential of translating into new uprisings. In the words of a Moroccan participant of the Arab Spring: “I am convinced that totalitarianism will disappear. For me it is not a question if that will happen, but how that will happen.”</p><p><em>Featured image: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tahrir_Square_-_February_9,_2011.png">Tahrir Square</a>, by Jonathan Rashad (CC BY 2.0)</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/">Safety first?

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>When the US National Basketball Association (NBA) was forced to pause the season due to Covid-19 on March 11 last year, the fans were naturally devastated. When the season resumed five months later, with the top 22 teams bubbled together and playing every game in Orlando, Florida, this was great news for the sport, and the fans — and a pair of US researchers. Andrew McHill at Oregon Health and Science University and Evan Chinoy at Leidos Inc, in San Diego, realised that the restart provided a perfect natural experiment to explore the effects of travel on play. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2">Their study</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, reveals some insights into causes of the well-documented sporting home-side advantage.</p>

<p>The “home-court” advantage, as it’s known in basketball, is apparent in the results tables: teams win more often at home than away. In normal circumstances, it’s hard, though, to disentangle all the possible variables that might underlie it. These include home-crowd noise, the discomfort of air travel, and time zone changes. In regular seasons, NBA teams do regularly travel long distances across the US, through one, two or even three time zones, to play away games. Many NBA players report resulting sleep loss and fatigue, and harmful effects on their performance, recovery and mood, the researchers note. Disruption to circadian rhythms has been considered the mostly likely culprit, though the rigours of travel and sleeping away from home have also been highlighted as potentially play a role.</p>



<p>To explore just how travel affects play, the researchers looked at the results of the 22 teams’ games before the pause, compared with their results while none were travelling and all were playing in one location, in Orlando. The pair also considered various aspects of the teams’ performances in each game.</p>



<p>In the first portion of the season, teams won 63.8% of their home games, and 50.8 % of their away games. McHill and Chinoy found, though, that there was only a disadvantage to playing away when a team had to travel across time zones, and not when they played away within the same time zone (the detrimental effects of travelling across time zones mostly occurred when teams travelled westwards, rather than eastward). When the teams were later all playing in Florida, with no travel (and only virtual fans), though a “home” and “away” team was designated for each game, there was no “home” advantage. </p>



<p>The researchers then looked more closely at various aspects of play. They found that when teams travelled across time zones, their shooting accuracy suffered. They also lost more possessions and scored fewer points per 100 possessions (indicating that they were playing more defensively). But even when a team played away and didn’t cross time zones, they played a more defensive game, and they got a lower percentage of the offensive rebounds (an event that gives the offensive team another opportunity to score).</p>



<p>McHill and Chinoy also found that when the teams did not travel, while bubbled, the typical home-court advantages for shooting accuracy and rebounding were reduced. “Thus, home-court advantage in professional basketball appears to be linked with the away team’s impaired shooting accuracy and rebounding,” the pair writes. They add that these “may be separately influenced by either circadian disruption or the general effect of travel, as these differences manifest differently when teams travel within or across multiple time zones.”  </p>



<p>Athletes in other major sports, including baseball, also travel regularly across time zones. If basketball shooting accuracy is taken as a measure of movement precision, and this is worsened by such travel, this could help to explain the home-side advantage — or the away-side disadvantage — in these sports, too. As the researchers also note: “Future work is needed to explore other athletic events where travel schedules can impact performance to further elucidate travel and circadian factors.”</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Humans process and recognise faces as a whole, rather than by examining individual features</strong>. Now new work suggests that some species of wasp also process faces in this “holistic” fashion, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/humans-wasps-seem-recognize-faces-more-sum-their-parts">reports Cathleen O’Grady</a> at <em>Science Magazine</em>. Golden paper wasps were better at recognising other wasps when shown pictures of the whole face rather than just part of it, the researchers found.</p>

<p><strong>When we lie to someone, we may end up mimicking their body language. </strong>That’s according to a study in which participants cheated while solving a puzzle, and then either told the truth or lied about their cheating to another participant. When the participant lied, pairs’ movements were more similar than when the participant told the truth, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264607-lying-makes-us-mimic-the-body-language-of-the-people-we-are-talking-to/">reports Christa Lesté-Lasserre</a> at <em>New Scientist.</em></p>

<p><strong>In the past year, have you found yourself endlessly scrolling through social media as the world falls apart? </strong>If so, you’re not alone — “doomscrolling” seems to be pretty common. At <em>Cosmic Shambles</em>, <a href="https://cosmicshambles.com/words/blogs/deanburnett/doomscrolling">Dean Burnett explains</a> just why this seemingly stressful activity is so appealing.</p>

<p><strong>Non-invasive brain stimulation might help to alleviate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29">reports Diana Kwon</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. Researchers found that transcranial alternating current stimulation delivered over the brain’s orbitofrontal cortex reduced compulsive behaviours in people who had OCD symptoms. But it remains to be seen whether similar results are found in people with a formal OCD diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>The COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out across the country — but can we also inoculate people against misinformation about the virus? </strong>At <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-misinformation-scientists-create-a-psychological-vaccine-to-protect-against-fake-news-153024">Sander van der Linden and Jon Roozenbeek explain their approach</a> to proactively protecting people from fake news.</p>

<p><strong>Teenagers “catch” moods from their peers — and this is particularly the case for bad moods, </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/20/teenagers-can-catch-moods-from-friends-study-finds">reports Sally Weale</a> at <em>The Guardian</em>. To figure out how moods were transmitted within teens’ social networks, researchers asked young musicians to keep diaries of their mood and social interactions during concert tours. The team also found the participants’ popularity wasn’t related to their mood.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/XZpljA2M98A/">PLOS and the Big Ten Academic Alliance Announce Publishing Deal</a></h4>

<p>The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for BTAA members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program. The agreement ensures time to test and evaluate this new community-based model and allows BTAA researchers to publish in <em>PLOS Biology </em>and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> without incurring fees. The BTAA and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.</p>



<p>The BTAA is the largest consortium globally to participate in both CAP communities, meaning that every member has committed to the full three-year pilot. As some of the largest research institutions in the world and major contributors to both journals, the BTAA commitment ensures this new collective action-based model kicks off with a strong foundation.</p>



<p>The Big Ten Academic Alliance members are: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Rutgers University–New Brunswick, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Maryland–College Park, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Chicago. PLOS has extended the benefits of this agreement to include most system, regional, and branch campuses of these universities.</p>



<p>“The Big Ten Academic Alliance’s commitment to this community-driven model demonstrates the power of collectives to transform scholarly publishing. This collaboration has been a partnership from the beginning and BTAA’s members and administration have been vital in helping us build and execute on this new experiment in sustainable highly selective publishing.” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.</p>



<p>Maurice York, BTAA’s Director of Library Initiatives, adds: “One of the key strategic questions in front of us is how to advance the growth of open science and open scholarship through collective and intentional action. We are actively seeking pathways to create a sustainable, scalable open knowledge ecosystem for our researchers and scholars. We are pleased to join together with PLOS to take up this pilot in common cause.”</p>



<p>PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">here</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing">here.</a></p>



<p>The BTAA publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS in 2020, following other agreements with the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a>.</p>

<p>In this episode, Emily Reynolds, staff writer at <em>Research Digest</em>, explores modern psychology’s relationship with race and representation. It’s well-known that psychology has a generalisability problem, with studies overwhelmingly using so-called “WEIRD” participants: those who are Western and educated and from industrialised, rich and democratic societies. But how does that shape the assumptions we make about participants of different racial identities or cultures? And how can top-tier psychology journals improve diversity among not only participants but also authors and editors?</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Personality traits were once thought to be fairly stable. But recent research has suggested that our personality can alter over time — whether that’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/">due to ageing</a> or because we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/">decide to change our traits ourselves</a>. And as personality is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/04/here-are-the-personality-traits-most-strongly-associated-with-being-environmentally-conscious/">linked to our behaviour</a>, it follows that we might see different life outcomes as our personality shifts or grows.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620957998">new study in <em>Psychological Science</em></a><em>, </em>Kevin A. Hoff and team look at the personality changes of teenagers as they move into adulthood. And they find that certain shifts in personality can result in real-world benefits during the early years of a career, suggesting that interventions that increase particular traits and skills could make all the difference at work.</p>



<span id="more-41171"></span>



<p>The team examined data from two longitudinal samples of young people from Iceland, who were followed over twelve years from their late teens to early adulthood; at several time-points, participants had rated their Big Five personality traits. The team also examined standardised test scores from the teenagers’ final year in education and noted the highest degree each participant had attained.</p>



<p>The researchers also rated participants’ “occupational prestige” once in the workforce — how high or low status their work was seen to be in general society. Participants also shared how much money they earned, and indicated how satisfied they were with what they had achieved in their career thus far and in their current job. </p>



<p>As expected, the personality traits of the teens changed as they entered young adulthood. The largest increases were seen in agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness, while extraversion decreased. Personality traits at adolescence were stronger predictors of participants’ academic achievement than personality <em>changes</em>: those who were more conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable were more likely to attain a higher degree. Emotional stability and conscientiousness at school-age were also the strongest predictors of occupational prestige.</p>



<p>Those personality changes, however, were also important. Participants who became more emotionally stable and those who became more extraverted were more likely to receive a higher income, while increases in emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness were the strongest predictors of career and job satisfaction across the samples.</p>



<p>We already know that we can change our personality and increase how outgoing, agreeable, or open we are. And given the results of the study, it also seems possible that targeted interventions to help young people develop the skills associated with particular personalities could help them achieve certain goals. The fact that personality growth was the strongest predictor of the subjective measures of career and job satisfaction also indicates that growth is an important part of <em>how</em> young people think about their success.</p>



<p>Though this study focused on work success, other areas of life could also be explored in future research. For some people, relationships, social skills or self-image are more important than their careers, and understanding how personality change can impact these dimensions would also be interesting. Certain personality traits are also likely to be more valued or useful in certain lines of work, so further exploration of this might also help teenagers work out which elements of their personality they would like to develop depending on their goals.</p>



<p>Helping teenagers understand that their personality is not fixed, the team concludes, is one of the most important takeaways from the study: while our personalities clearly play a part in our lives, we’re by no means fated to stay the same forever.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Good negotiators are more likely to secure a pay rise, get the house or job they want, and keep the peace at home. No end of psychological studies have explored which attitudes, behaviours, and settings will help a negotiation go your way. Here, we take a look at some of the key findings:</p>



<span id="more-41166"></span>



<p><strong>What’s the best way to prepare for a negotiation?</strong></p>



<p>Plenty of studies have found that people in positions of low power tend to do worse in a negotiation than people with high power. A job interviewer or someone with a desirable house to sell falls into the high-power category. So if you’re about to walk into an interview, or start negotiating over a house or car, say, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167215577365">it would help if you first engaged in a little self-affirmation</a>, according to a study on MBA students. Before going into a meeting in which they were acting as the would-be buyer of a biotech plant, some of the participants spent five minutes writing about their most important negotiating skill. In the subsequent negotiation, for this group, the typical high-power advantage of the “seller” was significantly reduced, and they secured lower sale prices.</p>



<p>Rather than going into a negotiation with the view that a gain for one side is a loss for the other (a so-called “win-lose mindset”), it’s worth remembering that, depending on the terms of the deal, it could be win-win. That’s according to the authors of a study published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> in 2019. The team found that <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000427">people in a position of financial vulnerability were more likely to hold the win-lose mindset</a> by default, and less likely to capitalise on any opportunities for both sides to gain. “By holding this win-lose mindset, financially disadvantaged people may continue to make poor deals, perpetuating their situation,” says Marko Pitesa at the Singapore Management University, who was involved in the research. But being aware of this mentality might help to stop it happening.</p>



<p><strong>How do I kick off a negotiation in the right way?</strong></p>



<p>A work-related negotiation doesn’t have to happen in the office, of course. In fact, a far better location would be a restaurant that serves food on sharing platters… This, at least, was the “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830633">shared plates, shared minds</a>” finding of a study published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2019. Pairs of participants who’d shared a single bowl of crisps and salsa went on to require, on average, nine rounds of negotiation to resolve a theoretical wage dispute, four rounds fewer than pairs who’d eaten the same snack from their own bowls. The shared eating promoted cooperation, the team thinks. “Basically, every meal that you’re eating alone is a missed opportunity to connect to someone,” says co-author Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago. “And every meal that involves food sharing fully utilizes the opportunity to create that social bond.”</p>



<p>A small alcoholic drink <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/17/a-small-alcoholic-drink-could-benefit-business-negotiations-study-finds/">could be a helpful addition to the meal, too</a>. When both participants in a bargaining game had one 350ml glass of beer, they became more collaborative, compared with those who’d drunk juice. “In settings in which skepticism can lead to a breakdown in negotiation, alcohol consumption can make people drop their guard for each other’s actions, thus facilitating reaching an agreement,” the team explains.</p>



<p><strong>Will anger help me get what I want? </strong></p>



<p>The idea that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/11/why-you-should-add-a-bit-of-grrrrr-to-your-negotiations/">you should add a bit of grrr to your negotiations</a> has a long history. While some studies have found that it isn’t a good idea, others have suggested that pretending you are angry can be helpful, especially if the person you are negotiating with is in a pretty weak position. However, the effect of anger <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/07/09/effect-of-anger-on-negotiations-depends-on-cultural-context/">does depend on the cultural context</a>: a 2010 study found that while it could help in a negotiation with someone from a European background, it backfired in negotiations with someone from an East Asian background, where traditionally such behaviour is regarded as inappropriate.</p>



<p>And the effect of getting angry on the negotiation will also depend at least partly on what you <em>expec</em>t it to be. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-29279-001">2017 study</a> published in <em>Emotion</em> found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/20/the-effect-of-emotions-on-your-behaviour-depends-partly-on-your-expectations/">participants in a negotiation task who’d been led to believe that anger would be helpful and who felt more angry during the task did make more money</a>. But for those who had not been guided in this way, whether they felt angry or not made no difference to how much money they made. As the team wrote: “At least in some cases, what we expect emotions to do may determine what they actually do.”</p>



<p><strong>Is face-to-face negotiation always best?</strong></p>



<p>Well, that depends… If you have Dark Triad tendencies — if you’d score highly for narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism — <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915300738?via=ihub">then yes, you’d be much better off negotiating in person</a>, according to a study of 200 Canadian students. The team asked the participants to negotiate for concert tickets, as a buyer or seller, either face-to-face or via text on a computer. Those who ranked higher on the Dark Triad spectrum did better in face-to-face negotiations than negotiations via the computer, whereas those who’d ranked low in these traits did better online compared to in-person. In fact, when negotiating via computer, those who’d placed higher on the Dark Triad spectrum were significantly less successful than the others. Whatever the ability of such people to charm, manipulate or intimidate others in person, they lose this edge when negotiating online, the team concludes. This also implies, of course, that if you think your boss might have Dark Triad tendencies, it could be better to conduct a negotiation over a pay rise by email rather than face-to-face.</p>



<p>When it comes to negotiations via text, there are a few other things to consider. For instance, a negotiating pair is more likely to reach mutually agreeable terms in an online discussion <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/07/physical-distance-boosts-the-success-of-computer-based-negotiation/">when they think of each other as being physically distant, rather than physically close</a>. In this study, two people did the negotiating. But what if you used an Artificial Intelligence agent to do your negotiating — a task that AI agents, or bots, are tipped to take over? This does affect our negotiation strategies, according to a recent study in the US. Among other things, the team found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/27/were-more-willing-to-use-deceitful-tactics-when-a-bot-does-the-negotiating/">less experienced negotiators are more likely to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What about negotiating at home?</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t like a job offer, or a bid for your house, you don’t have to take it. But if you’re in a relationship, and want to stay in it, you will have to find ways to negotiate your way through all kinds of disagreements, from the minor — such as plans for the weekend — to the major (whether to take a job in another country, say.)</p>



<p>In all these situations, it would be worth bearing in mind the results of a recent analysis of data on more than 32,000 people from nine different countries: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/25/how-making-sacrifices-for-a-partner-or-saying-you-will-affects-wellbeing/"> if you feel that you would in theory be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both</a>. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just <em>says</em> that they would), it’s a different story. The data suggests that in these situations, the person actually making a sacrifice tends to feel the burden of it. Gaining a major concession from your partner could clearly, then, end up being a case not merely of win-lose, but lose-lose.</p>



<p>So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology/">What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?</a></h4>

<p>You know the way Google search will sometimes finish your sentences for you? Or, when you’re typing an email, there’s some ghostly predictive text that floats just in front of your cursor? Well, there’s a new kid on the block that makes these gadgets look like toy tricks out of a Christmas cracker. Give it a sentence of Jane Austen and it will finish the paragraph in the same style. Give it a philosophical conjecture and it will fill the page with near-coherent academic ruminations. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1">GPT-3</a> is essentially just predicting what words should come next, following on from the prompt it’s been given. That the machine does so well is partly because it’s been trained on an unimaginably huge database of samples of English (reputedly, $13 million worth of training). A similar machine can predict, from a sequence of amino acids, how the resulting protein will fold, short-cutting months of lab work and in some cases years of human ingenuity (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold</a>). But what is going on inside the machine? What is it keeping track of inside its huge neural network “brain”?</p><p>We face the same question, of course, when we look at the human brain—a seemingly inscrutable organ of even greater complexity. Yet neuroscience is beginning to make sense of what’s going on inside: of patterns of activity distributed across millions of neurons, flowing into other patterns; coupling and modulating; unfolding in a way that opens the organism to the world outside, projected through its inner space of needs and drives, bathed in the wash of past experience, reaching out to control and modify that world to its own agenda. We can now see what some of these patterns of activity are, and we have an inkling of what they are doing, of how they track the environment, and subserve behaviour.</p><p>Neuroscientists are recording these patterns with new techniques. But what do the patterns mean? How should they be understood? Neuroscience is increasingly tackling these questions by asking what the activation patterns <em>represent</em>. For example, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308009434">“representational similarity analysis”</a> (RSA) is used to ask whether the human brain processes images in the same way as the brain of the macaque monkey. Surprisingly, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619.short">similar techniques</a> can be used to compare the human brain to an AI computer system trained to perform the same task. These AIs are deep neural networks, cousins of the seemingly unfathomable GPT-3 and AlphaFold brains we met at the start. Astoundingly, it turns out that sometimes the deep neural network is processing images in roughly the same way as the human brain. In a general sense, both are performing the same computations en route to working out that they are looking at a picture of two cats on a sofa. In other cases, we see the brain using a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~papers.nips.cc/paper/9104-better-transfer-learning-with-inferred-successor-maps">hexagonal code</a> to represent physical space—and more abstract conceptual spaces—and to reason about them.</p><p>All of this means that representation has become something of a hot topic in cognitive neuroscience. Representation has always been around, of course, working away in the foundations ever since the “cognitive revolution” showed that we could explain behaviour in terms of internal processing without having to feel embarrassed about intelligent homunculi or ghosts in the machine. What we have now are much better ways to see those representations in the brain and to marry them up with the computational story about how the organism intelligently deals with its environment.</p><div><blockquote><p>“representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour”</p></blockquote></div><p>What we still need is a proper understanding of what representation is—an understanding of how there come to be things in the head which stand in for, and allow creatures to deal with, things in their environment. A once-unconventional idea in contemporary philosophy (originating with Ruth Millikan, David Papineau, and Karen Neander) is that this is intimately tied up with function—biological functions based on natural selection. Although a connection to function may have always been implicit in some scientific practice, it is now being recognised explicitly (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3017">Hunt et al. 2012</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2">Richards et al. 2019</a>). For example, in a recent manifesto for the role of representation in computational cognitive neuroscience, Kriegeskorte and Diedrichsen (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-080317-061906">2019</a>) argue that representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour. Meanwhile in philosophy, appealing to natural teleology to explain representation has moved into the mainstream, being embraced by researchers from diverse disciplinary starting points (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9432-4">David Haig</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-metaphysics-of-representation-9780198850205">Robert Williams</a>), alongside recent landmark contributions from early advocates (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mark-mental">Karen Neander</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/beyond-concepts-9780198717195">Ruth Millikan</a>).</p><p>The devil is in the details, of course, but it is beginning to look as if we have the main ingredients in place: internal states that stand in useful relations to things in the environment, internal processing which relies on those relations, and the functions that serves for the organism. Just as the cognitive sciences come to lean on representation ever more heavily, it seems that we now have the resources to understand this foundational notion.</p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stock.adobe.com/images/brain-data-ai-technology-robotic-molecule-of-chemical-atom-cell-science-hacker-online-cyber-network-system-of-background-illustration-3d-rendering-futuristic-cloud-storage-deep-learning/271835259">issaronow</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/what-is-representation-in-the-human-brain-and-ai-systems/">What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/641921470/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/641921470/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/" rel="nofollow">Safety first?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/fDxkkE9i7GI/">PLOS and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network Announce Community Action Publishing Deal</a></h4>

<p></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA and OTTAWA, ON — The Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for CRKN members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program, a new collective action publishing model from PLOS, enabling 19 participating CRKN institutions to publish fee-free in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> and<em> PLOS</em> <em>Biology. </em>This model shifts publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history as affiliated with corresponding and contributing authors. The group collectively contributes to the shared cost recovery target and any surplus revenue collected by PLOS is redistributed to members.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to welcome PLOS’ very first Canadian partners to our Community Action Publishing program. Despite a very difficult budget landscape, Canadian institutions’ commitment to community-driven Open Access experimentation remains as strong as ever,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “As ever, we’re excited to partner with institutions sharing our mission to further equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing.”</p>



<p>“CRKN members’ participation in this innovative publishing initiative from PLOS highlights Canada’s dedication to furthering open access,” commented Clare Appavoo, Executive Director of CRKN. “Bold ideas drive our community forward, and it is inspiring to see publishers like PLOS advancing new business models for open scholarship. We look forward to collaborating with PLOS as the model and program develop.”</p>



<p>CRKN participating members include: Brock University, McMaster University, Mount Allison University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Ontario Tech University, Queen’s University, Simon Fraser University, Université Laval, University of Alberta, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa, University of Saskatchewan, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, Western University, Wilfrid Laurier University, and York University.</p>



<p>Under the Community Action Publishing agreement, which began on January 1, 2021, authors from participating CRKN institutions will have unlimited publishing in <em>PLOS Medicine </em>and<em> PLOS Biology</em> through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating CRKN institutions are eligible, and new institutions are permitted to join the agreement at any time during this initial three-year period. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.</p>



<p>CRKN, which represents 81 academic and research institutions across Canada, joins the University of California and Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) among others in signing open access publishing agreements with PLOS in the last year.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We all know that using a smartphone interferes with our ability to focus on other things — like driving. But in 2017, a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462">surprising result</a> made international headlines: the mere presence of a switched off smartphone on the desk can impair working memory. Now a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020301975?via=ihub">new study</a> in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em>, which has partially replicated and extended this investigation, has <em>not</em> found evidence to support the “brain drain” effect. However, the researchers, led by Matthias Hartmann at University of Bern, Switzerland, say that we shouldn’t start putting our phones back on our desks just yet.</p>



<span id="more-41158"></span>



<p>The 2017 study was led by Adrian Ward at the University of Texas, Austin. His team found that people who’d been instructed to put their phones in another room performed significantly better on tests designed to measure their cognitive capacity than those who had their phones on the desk. They also did slightly better than participants who’d put their phone in a pocket or bag. It didn’t matter whether their phones were off or on or face up or down; just having the phone easily accessible meant that people had to resist the impulse to use it, which used some of their available cognitive capacity, the team concluded. This meant they had less to spare on the tasks, which drew on working memory.</p>



<p>Hartmann and his colleagues decided to investigate possible impacts on two other types of memory: short term memory and also prospective memory — remembering to do something in the future. They recruited 302 participants with a mean age of about 22, and asked all to put their phones into flight mode. Half were told that they could leave their phone on their desk, while the other half had their phones taken by the experimenter and placed on the opposite side of the room, so that, they were told, they would not be distracted by them. (Since it’s normal to ask study participants not to use their phones, the team didn’t expect this to alert them to the nature of the study.)</p>



<p>The participants were then presented with a series of pictures of easily identifiable objects paired with unrelated words. They were told to read each word aloud and to memorise the pictures. Every so often, they were asked to say out loud as many of the pictures as they could remember from the previous block, and an experimenter wrote these down. This was the test of their short-term memory. Before embarking on a second series of word-picture presentations, they were told to inform the experimenter whenever they saw a word that belonged in the category of “musical instruments”. This tested their prospective memory.</p>



<p>The team found that whether participants’ phones were in clear view or on the other side of the room made no overall difference to performance on these memory tasks. The participants had also completed questionnaires measuring their impulsiveness and their levels of smartphone dependence, and, when the team took a closer look at this data, a link — albeit an unexpected one — did pop out. Those people who ranked low for smartphone dependence did poorer on the prospective memory test when their phone was in view.</p>



<p>What should we make of all this? Given the 2017 findings, “the lack of an effect of smartphone presence on short-term memory performance was surprising,” the team writes. There were some methodological differences between the two studies, they note. Further work to more perfectly replicate the initial study is now needed.</p>



<p>As for the prospective memory findings, “our results seem to suggest that the benefit of smartphone absence disappears for people with higher levels of smartphone dependency,” the team writes, “as if the negative effects of missing one’s own smartphone when it is absent counteracts the positive effect of smartphone absence.” However, given the limited data so far, it’s too early to draw any firm conclusions.</p>



<p>The researchers stress that there is strong evidence from a range of earlier studies that “personally relevant” stimuli — like our phones — can impair our performance on cognitive tasks. “Our results should therefore not motivate people to put their smartphones on their desks at work,” they conclude. </p>



<p>– <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020301975">Does a smartphone on the desk drain our brain? No evidence of cognitive costs due to smartphone presence in a short-term and prospective memory task</a></p>

<p><em>Ladds et. al</em> describes “long Covid” as fluctuating symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, fever, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations, cognitive deficits, myalgia, neurological symptoms, skin rashes, and diarrhoea beyond 3-4 weeks after infection. Despite the great advances in COVID-19 research, there is minimal knowledge about managing “long Covid”. This is emphasized by the participant’s instrumental role in the recruitment and development of this study. This online qualitative study reports the experiences of 114 participants from the UK weeks after their acute illness to better understand COVID-19. These focus groups reveal that those who experience “long Covid” endure difficulty accessing health services despite their uncertain prognosis and occasionally severe reoccurring symptoms. This study informs a basis to improve services while highlighting the importance of patient support groups to better navigate this ambiguous illness.</p>

<p>As cannabis consumption increases worldwide, it is crucial to investigate the effects of prenatal and maternal cannabis use on birth outcomes. <em>Michalski et al</em>. observe that pre-pregnancy cannabis users experience 2.0 times the odds of birthing an infant with low birth weight, small size for gestational age, or preterm birth. Here, 216 women self-reported cannabis use in their pre/early pregnancy period while disclosing low rates of concurrent substance use such as alcohol and tobacco. While many studies aim to investigate this trend among pregnant women, this Ontario-based study confirms the specific impacts of cannabis use on infant health. Although there is more research to complete in regards to other modes of cannabis consumption, this study emphasizes the need for clinical messaging to expecting mothers.</p>

<p><em>Boedeker et. al</em> performed a systematic review examining the prevalence of a widely overlooked national and international public health issue called unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning. This study identified that farm workers and farmers account for 385 million cases of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning cases and around 11,000 deaths per year due to occupational exposure. Boedecker and team conclude this only accounts for a fraction of annual poisonings as registers and hospitals may underreport non-fatal events. Unfortunately, unintentional acute pesticide poisoning can lead to chronic outcomes such as a decreased quality of life or even the inability to continue working arguing the imperative of enhancing the accuracy of national databases and improving access to medical care and education.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the availability of mental health care for migrant populations who continue to experience high levels of mental health issues. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 10 psychotherapists across Germany whom have experience in dealing with refugee’s mental health problems, the authors were able to identify three main challenges in this cross-cultural practice. These include, differing or unrealistic expectations of clients towards what psychotherapy may offer, challenges integrated in illness explanatory models and communication challenges. Aside from identifying the main challenges with cross-cultural psychotherapy the authors showed that psychotherapy with refugees can be extremely successful but identifies challenges that underline the importance of designing and introducing new structural approaches to training psychotherapists for the introduction of psychotherapy at scale. As the incidence of mental health problems among refugee populations continues to increase, the ability to provide appropriate mental health support to these vulnerable individuals becomes ever more important.</p>

<p>For Governments and health systems, dealing with end-of-life issues presents a major challenge. Despite progress in the introduction of relevant legislature, many barriers still exist to its proper implementation. By conducting 37 in-depth interviews with professionals and decision makers associated with the health care system in Israel the authors were able to identify 6 major barriers to coping with end-of-life issues. These include, Law procedures, Clinical aspects, Human aspects, Knowledge/skill, Communication and finally Resource allocation. They find that ubiquitously the relationship between the patient and their clinical care teams is important. With medical teams often in daily contact with the patient they inherit significant responsibility in implementation of end-of-life care. The authors conclude that by improving or championing accessibility to homes able to provide appropriate care for end-of-life needs, increased public and health system awareness, and support in understanding end-of-life laws, health systems and governments can aim to ensure the best care for end-of-life patients.</p>

<h4>To spike or not to spike?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f-PUy8OtUgBjR9CStS5Jzw.jpeg" /></figure><p>It is well known that a neuron is the main cell of the nervous system. It generates electrical pulses as large as 0.1Volts, has sprouts — axons (as long as 1 meter) and dendrites (several millimeters), and lives more than 100 years. You will not find another more marvelous cell in the body. Still, I will not write about biological details (despite how interesting they are). Rather, I will try to define the most important computational principles, which might help with the progression to artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Convergence towards principles always leads to simplification and generalization, but it can be dangerous. The brain is too diverse. You can simplify too much and lose something important. Let’s dare to try. Ultimately, it is an iterative process. We merely want to become less wrong with time.</p><h4><strong>Principle 1. Neurons are binary</strong></h4><p>A neuron generates and transmits electrical pulses (also called spikes). They are very similar in amplitude and duration, so they can be treated as binary events (spike=1, no spike=0). Yet, we don’t fully understand how exactly thousands and millions of neurons represent knowledge, perform basic calculations, and store casual relationships.</p><p>Some neurons transmit information by the frequency of spikes. For example, the more a motor-neuron activates in the spinal cord, the stronger the muscle contracts. For a long time, people thought that other neurons in the cerebral cortex send information in a similar way. After the famous Hubel and Wiesel experiments, we know that a neuron in a visual area has a higher spike frequency for a particular stimulus. If the cat sees the vertical line, a particular neuron activates very fast, but if we rotate the line — the neuron slows down. This can be summarized in a tuning curve:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/325/1*fpzzvLZv1y6FskcgHK0FCA.png" /></figure><p>For many decades, the idea of frequency coding was dominant. Even now, artificial neural networks use the same coding (real numbers). But a nasty problem ruins the frequency view: to “measure” the rate of firing you need to wait for a long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to average spikes.</p><p>However, the brain computes much faster. Humans need around 100 ms to recognize an object. Information travels from the retina to the thalamus, then is projected to the visual cortex, where it hops across three or four areas before reaching the IT area. Here the recognition of an object occurs. Taking into account the time for spike generation (2–5 ms) and spike propagation (roughly 10–20ms), there is just enough time to send 1–2 pulses… and no way to wait longer to “send” the frequency of firing.</p><p>Therefore, individual spikes (0 or 1) somehow should be enough to transmit information. Currently, the prevailing idea is that an individual neuron does not send a lot, but many of them can encode anything (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Population_coding">population coding</a>).</p><p>Once, my friend asked me: “How does the brain encode information? Perhaps with something super complex?”. “No”, I said. “Most likely, it uses a binary code similar to computers, but the principles are very different.” Neural coding is one of the most compelling areas of research with many mysteries and open problems. Intriguingly, it relates nicely to information theory. It is not just about data representation, but about something fundamental, about the organization of matter to reflect nature.</p><p>Though we are still far from fully understanding the neural code. There are bursting neurons that emit many spikes very fast. Can we simplify the burst of pulses as one binary event? Neuromodulators change how the neuron is excited. Possibly, different brain regions (like sensory and motor) use different coding schemes. Yet, most likely the main tasks like recognition, memory, and planning use binary codes (that can be modulated in various ways).</p><h4><strong>Principle 2. Neurons integrate information</strong></h4><p>A typical neuron in neocortex has around 10 000 connections and more than 100 of them are active simultaneously. Information integration means that a neuron “hears” all 10 thousand “calls” and compresses them to 0 or 1 (spike or no spike). Mathematically, 10 thousand neurons can be active in 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ possible ways (0 or 1 for each input). We could enumerate and put all of them into a table (two columns, 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ rows) but even the whole universe could not store it. Alternatively, we can write the table in a compact form as some function (y=f(x)).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/733/1*YKHv4Y7JMOot_27ipsYtnA.png" /></figure><p>Maybe the biggest advantage of a neuron is that it can change its inner parameters (like the weights <strong>w </strong>in artificial neurons). Biologically, these parameters are realized as synapses between neurons, or as a distribution of ion channels on a membrane, or other molecules that determine the excitability of a cell. By changing the parameters, a neuron can change its function, its answers to 10 000 inputs. Parameters add new columns to this gigantic table and can be written as a parametric function y=f(x, w). The number of different functions the neuron can realize is called expressivity. The larger the expressivity, the more ways a neuron can integrate information. And it is crucial for learning, which is essentially a search for the right function.</p><p>For the last 20 years, people showed that the expressivity of a biological neuron is much larger than previously thought. It turns out that the dendrites do not simply transmit the signal to the center of a cell but process it along the way. If a local dendritic branch gets activated too much, it can amplify the signal (an event called a dendritic spike).Thus, synapses that are active close in space and time excite the cell much larger than simultaneous but non-local signals. This is important: read it once more. Here is a helpful picture.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*T7fePm4EPGdF7FizBYzeaQ.png" /></figure><p>On the left, three axons (in color) bring the activation from three neurons and spread their synapses randomly. On the right, synapses concentrate locally. The right neuron is excited more, and more likely generates an action potential (the figure shows three axons for simplicity, usually a neuron needs more to fire).</p><p>Therefore, not only the strength of a connection is important but its location. Because of this, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00300/full">people argued</a> for a new learning paradigm: not only the weights but their locations also store information.</p><p>The larger the dendritic tree, the more ways to arrange synapses, thus the more ways to activate the neuron and the larger the expressivity. Interestingly, evolutionary smarter animals have a larger dendritic tree. The picture below shows the pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin (<a href="https://elib.oa.edu.ua/items/show/1153">source </a>in Russian). Similarly, humans have more elaborate dendritic trees compared to chimpanzees (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/10/2429/295312">source</a>). Maybe, with more powerful neurons animals get higher intelligence.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*kZMZ5wS_4_uVEPbB37y4Lw.png" />Pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin</figure><p>Old models of a neuron (like ReLU or threshold) are called “point” models. They do not include dendrites and are computationally weaker. Such models people still use in artificial neural networks and do not want to adopt new, more complex neurons. One of the reasons is that it’s not clear how to learn a new model with active dendrites. Another reason is that by collecting together many simple neurons you can achieve the same expressivity as a single complex neuron. So, more or less, a two-layer network corresponds to a biological neuron. Read a really <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/your-cortex-contains-17-billion-computers-9034e42d34f2">captivating article</a> that explains it in depth.</p><p>Yet, even this is an overly simplistic view — a real neuron is more powerful.</p><h4><strong>Principle 3. Neurons integrate information in time</strong></h4><p>Spike or not to spike is the final result of all preceding computations. Still, it doesn’t simply discharge like a capacitor. The neuron remembers what happened before. Mathematically, a neuron is a complex dynamical system with time-varying parameters. Simple neuronal models can not describe all phenomena. For example, the same inputs at one time elicit activation and at another — don’t. A neuron remembers not simply a correct combination of neurons among 10 000 but <strong><em>when</em></strong><em> </em>this combination occurs. As if the neuron looks over the window <strong>T</strong> back in time and makes a decision (0 or 1) based on (2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰)^T possible scenarios. It opens the way for remembering sequences by a single neuron.</p><p>One such mechanism of integration across time is the control of neuronal excitability. Once a neuron becomes active from a stimulus “A” it can change its inner parameter (for example the concentration of the protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB">CREB</a>) to make itself more easily activated in the future. Even after many hours, this neuron will be activated from another stimulus “B” with a higher probability. One neuron gets activated for two stimuli and links them together. Since the memory is stored distributed across many neurons there will be an overlapping population of cells that stored a causal relationship “A-&gt;B” . Changing neuronal excitability may be the way we form episodic memory (here is a nice <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069162.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190069162-e-7">review</a>).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*mo81zqIUIPg3rqjSSVSqVg.gif" /></figure><p>Another mechanism is when a neuron stores sequential information in other neurons. Active neurons excite other cells and shape a particular network activity (called the “context”). After a certain time, the context may cause the activation of some other neuron. This neuron encodes the previous history (a sequence) that shaped that context. This is the domain of recurrent neural networks in which it is extremely hard to unravel the chain of computations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*2CRtXL1zUu2SJLG3pnV8YQ.png" /></figure><p>Yet another way how a neuron preserves memory is via its spines, the places where axons attach the dendrites. They also have inner parameters that can be changed to store information. One hypothesis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_tagging">synaptic tagging</a>) proposes that spines “remember” the previous activation by expressing some tag. Later, the activation of a synapse interferes with the tag, which makes the connection stronger. That is why sometimes people argue for learning of different time scales (like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258">here</a>). Some parameters can change quickly in response to rapid events. And some change very slowly, reflecting things happening over minutes, hours and more.</p><p>The lesson is — the neurons are very variable. They can change themselves (ion channels, spines, other proteins…) to record the spatial and temporal activation of the network overall.</p><h4><strong>Principle 4. Neurons learn … to survive</strong></h4><p>A neuron is a living cell, and like any other it has needs. It consumes a lot of energy to fire electrical pulses. This energy must come from somewhere. Here neurons receive help from astrocytes, supportive glial cells, that live close to neurons, with around one astrocyte for three neurons.</p><p>Astrocytes sense when the neuron becomes active and change the permeability of blood capillaries to increase the flow of oxygen and glucose. These molecules are consumed by neuronal mitochondria that stores energy in the molecule ATP. Once, I had an Aha moment: “The goal of a neuron to become active to get nutrients. It activates and learns to survive!” Subsequently, I did not find any facts that support or reject this idea (that neuronal activity is the only way to get “food”). But the idea is interesting.</p><p>Another similar and verified idea is homeostasis: a neuron sustains a target level of firing. If the activity exceeds or falls under the target level, the neuron launches the mechanics to return to this level. For example, a neuron can strengthen or weaken its connections (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_scaling">synaptic scaling</a>) or change its threshold for firing an action potential.</p><p>An interesting idea is that to be active just enough neurons change not only themselves, but try to change other neurons. They compete and cooperate with each other. A neuron tries to become active and prevent its neighbors from firing, a process called “winner takes all”. Or neurons try to “help” other distant neurons by activating them (hoping they will return the favour sometime). Of course, it is just a story where neurons, like warriors on a battlefield, survive, fight, create alliances. Nevertheless, it helps to link many experimental facts. Neurons indeed can activate local inhibitory cells that in turn decrease activation of other local neurons (“competition”). In addition, neurons in the visual cortex create distant connections with other neurons that encode similar stimuli (“cooperation”). Still, to confirm the story many experiments need to be done. And hopefully we will answer one of the most important questions in learning — how neurons choose with whom to connect.</p><p>I wrote that a neuron tracks the combinations among 10 000 connected neurons. Actually, it learns to recognize among 100,000 neurons. If two neurons are not connected but the axon of the first is close to the dendrite of a second, a connection may arise. It is structural plasticity — the creation and deletion of connections. A typical neuron in the neocortex has approximately 100,000 potential candidates to form the connection. What a possibility to reshape the network!</p><p>Structural plasticity is prominent especially in children, who have a lot of excessive synapses. With aging (till around 30 years) the connections are pruned and the most valuable remain. The speed of this process varies in different brain regions: in some, like the parietal and frontal cortex, it takes longer to fully mature. But how to choose which connections to delete? One of the answers is the principle “use it or lose it”. Connections that are used rarely get eliminated. It is a highly selective procedure — one axon may climb to a particular neuron avoiding everyone else on its way.</p><p>Many theories of synaptic plasticity explain the changing of the strength of connections. Still, it is not completely clear how precise this strength might be. In artificial neural networks, the weight is a real number, for instance, 0.63737. True, neuronal spines vary in shape and size and a neuron can change the number and effectiveness of ion channels through which the positive ions pass and excite it ( ehh, I have to skip so many fascinating details). <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778">Some estimates</a> show that a synapse can store 4.7 bits of information, so it has 2^(4.7)=26 different states. Hence, learning is the change from one state to another. However, it is still debatable how long and how reliably the spine can remain in a given state. At least, we can treat the spine as one bit of information: are the two neurons connected? (And a couple more bits for the location of the synapse on a dendrite).</p><h4><strong>Principle 5. Neurons make errors and it’s okay</strong></h4><p>In reality, synapses are very unreliable and stochastic. Often, neurons fail to transmit the signal, neurotransmitters may be “stuck” inside the axon. The successful transmission happens with some probability. That is why it is hard to reason about the strength of the connection. Interestingly, it may be not the weakness of evolution that could not invent reliable wires, but the discovery of how to make learning more efficient. Some theories suggest that stochastic connections may actually help. Neurons in some animals can change the probability of synaptic release as a way of learning (see a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2634">good review</a>). How common is this phenomenon in the human brain? How important is it computationally? We don’t know. New research is needed.</p><p>Not just synapses, but neurons can be noisy as well. Sometimes they can even die. In some brain regions the death of neurons is very bad. Like in the brain stem where neurons control breathing, blood pressure, and sustain life. However, in most regions neurons might die and nothing terrible will happen.</p><p>In contrast, the loss of some transistors could damage the whole chip and the computer stops working. Brain architecture is evolved to be stable to errors, to failure of neurons and synapses. Information is encoded in a large population of neurons, from multiple modalities (vision, hearing…). Thus, there is no grandmother neuron, the neuron that encodes only the grandmother. Otherwise, when that neuron dies — the memory is lost. One neuron does not encode only one stimulus but many. One memory is encoded in many neurons. If some cells make errors, no worries, the information remains. In case of massive cell death, like in a stroke, a function of the neurons might weaken, but later neuroplasticity reassigns the overload among other neurons.</p><p>This is an important principle: if you build AI with brain-like neuronal networks, you must ask yourself “will my algorithm still work if I remove 10% of neurons? Or 20%?”</p><p>Surely, this was not a complete list of all principles. But these five are among the most important.</p><p>Hopefully, you will remember that a neuron is a living cell. It doesn’t care about information processing and computation, it just wants to survive. Yet, it is fascinating that, while surviving, a neuron makes computation.</p><p>I am thankful to <a href="https://medium.com/u/6bce9fc81f1f">Mark Humphries</a> for suggestions and saving this article from a grammatical mess :)</p><p>Follow on: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ai.territory">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/AiTerritory">Twitter</a>.</p><p>This is the fifth article in the blog series “AI Territory”.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/iKO_nh8kZdA/">Imagining a Transformed Scientific Publication Landscape</a></h4>

<p>Open Science is not a finish line, but rather a means to an end. An underlying goal behind the movement towards Open Science is to conduct and publish more reliable and thoroughly reported research. Increasing the transparency, reusability and connectivity of scientific outputs is a common desire shared among publishers and researchers, but progress can seem slow and implementation far from widespread. </p>



<p>Akin to how scientific understanding is often achieved through incremental progress, system-wide changes toward Open Science will only be achieved through earnest collaboration among funders, institutions, publishers and researchers. Looking at both pragmatic solutions and the underlying ideals, we imagine changes to scientific publishing in the context of four fundamental functions that publishers should provide: dissemination, verification, recognition and community building. </p>



<h3>Dissemination</h3>



<p><em>How can the future provide more usable, accessible and relevant dissemination? </em></p>



<p>The term “research article” is largely used as a catch-all for published discoveries. A research article is typically consumed as a static PDF that’s sent to publishers after results have been accrued and conclusions drawn. Readers must wait until the study is complete and the associated paper published before they can access the methodology, which may have been finalized months or years prior. </p>



<p>Breaking down the research article into more digestible and structured parts—or modules—can provide researchers with more opportunities to reuse and improve research. Incomplete reporting of methods in traditional articles can prevent research from being reused or reproduced. More opportunities to publish detailed and enhanced methods are the two article types coming soon to <em>PLOS ONE</em>: <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">Lab Protocols and Study Protocols</a>. </p>



<p>Lab Protocols, developed in partnership with <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a>, share the step-by-step instructions for verified methodologies and computational techniques. Utilizing the specialised features of protocols.io’s platform in conjunction with a peer-reviewed article on <em>PLOS ONE</em> that contextualizes the presented methodology, Lab Protocols will provide readers with the information needed to replicate a validated method in a precise and accessible format. Study Protocols are open for planned research studies, giving readers an opportunity to see design and analysis plans and helping reduce waste and bias in research. </p>



<p>In the future, studies should be presented as a collection of interlinked research objects and associated metadata. Data, code, protocols, and other elements such as reagents can all be independently identified and verified, allowing for readers to more easily find and access the elements most relevant to them. </p>



<h3>Verification</h3>



<p><em>How can widespread adoption of Open Science provide more reliable and reproducible research?</em></p>



<p>The ultimate test for the reporting and validity of a study is whether it can be fully reproduced by different researchers. The materials used, the steps of the methods and the experimental conditions must be precisely described for a study to be reproducible. Reproduction of previous research can be a jumping-off point for contemporary researchers that leads to new discoveries. In short, proper reporting helps advance the field and accelerate further discoveries. </p>



<p>On platforms such as protocols.io, researchers can verify if published protocols work for them. Alongside participating researchers, publishers are important in the verification of publications by organising peer review, which can be customised for different research outputs. For Lab Protocols, <em>PLOS</em> will be organizing peer review of submitted manuscripts and content hosted on protocols.io: a small step toward extending the value publishers can offer in verifying the validity of research and improving trust in new research formats. </p>



<p>Transparency enables verification. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">Preregistration</a> enables interrogation of what was planned and what was carried out, and publishing peer reviews and preprints allow readers to view changes that occur during peer review. Direct links to deposited data and executable code gives an opportunity to work with the same material as the original authors. </p>



<p>Having these elements—protocols, data, code, review history—available and linked to research articles reduces dependencies on the original authors of a study, promoting efficiency. A study that can be replicated with available and easy-to-find information allows the research to be usable far in the future. </p>



<h3>Recognition</h3>



<p><em>How can reward and incentive systems be improved to provide researchers with credit for more of their research? </em></p>



<p>The perceived success of a researcher has traditionally been dependent on the credit they receive through publications. Career advancement and other rewards can be determined by how research outputs are valued and recognized, and thus recognizing diverse and more granular research contributions beyond publications is essential for researchers to be rewarded for their work appropriately.</p>



<p>The CRediT—required by all PLOS authors and publications—offers a more nuanced view of authorship and contributorship. By providing new opportunities for peer-reviewed publications that reward critical but sometimes overlooked contributions, such as a methods development, publishers can provide opportunities for diverse elements of the research process to be better recognized. </p>



<p>Peer-reviewed protocols give authors a formal publication that enables their methods to be cited, shared and used as a signal of accomplishment. Similar opportunities exist for sharing, describing and citing research datasets and software, which need to be more widely adopted by the wider scientific community, furthering chances for additional recognition. </p>



<p>Publishers are just part of the solution. Institutions and funders can work with publishers to recognise and reward researchers for working transparently and reproducibly. Researchers can benefit personally from presenting their research in open, reusable formats as this can drive collaboration and reuse—and can consider Open Science principles when assessing studies by their peers. </p>



<h3>Community Building</h3>



<p><em>How can Open Science provide more opportunities to collaborate and connect? </em></p>



<p>The scientific community has made great progress in making Coronavirus research as Open as possible. With authors across disciplines depositing their articles as preprints and publishers making relevant research fully accessible, the benefits of Open Science have been made even clearer. By connecting researchers through peer review and providing structures to make relevant research shareable and accessible without barriers, journals help researchers build and maintain their communities. The role journals have in supporting these communities will continue to evolve as innovative new ways for researchers to collaborate and connect develop.</p>



<p>If these sweeping changes have helped improve scientific discovery in a period of global need, they could be adopted in other areas of research. Comprehensive commitment to Open Science requires the full scientific community, as publishers alone cannot persuade such practices to be adopted. For research to be more efficiently disseminated, verified and credited, system-wide changes toward Open Access must be embraced across the scientific community.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong><u>Background</u></strong></p>
<p>Recent publications have focused excessively on the mode of delivery.</p>
<p>To go beyond the sole question of the mode of delivery, an ontological approach was applied to understand the observation of perinatal morbidity. Indeed, unmeasured fetal and maternal factors can at least partly explain the breech delivery dilemma (planned cesarean section or trial of labor).</p>
<p><strong><u>What are the unresolved questions?</u></strong></p>
<p>Neither the weakness of a unique randomized trial, nor the imperfection of the older observational population based studies could clearly help explain the observed increase of perinatal morbidity with breech delivery.</p>
<p>Some authors argue that planned cesarean section may decrease perinatal morbidity. However, this argument does not take into account potential complications for subsequent pregnancies and the maternal choice to avoid a cesarean section, especially in favorable cases of breech vaginal delivery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, planned vaginal delivery could also be harmful and potentially unethical in unselected women.</p>
<p>Therefore we identify a need for an individualized approach to the management of term breech presentation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12235" style="width: 570px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12235" height="420" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-300x225.jpg" width="560" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1: The complex puzzle of breech presentation</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><strong><u>Deterministic or accidental breech presentation? </u></strong></p>
<p>Several recent population-based data studies reported that breech presentation was associated with prenatal factors that could also be related to maternal and/or perinatal morbidity and mortality. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetal : fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, congenital fetal malformation, unknown breech presentation</li>
<li>Maternal : gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a history of CS, congenital uterine malformation</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings are in line with the greater risk of term antepartum stillbirth in breech presentation as compared to cephalic presentation (2-2.5‰ versus 0.5-1.5‰)</p>
<p>These points highlight the importance of screening for breech presentation of pregnancy at and beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy as well as estimating fetal weight (restriction or overgrowth) and well-being in cases of persistent breech presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Strict selection for favorable attempt breech delivery</u></strong></p>
<p>Most national guidelines now (American, British, French, Australian and New-Zealand) propose comparable pre-established criteria for a careful selection of favorable cases for breech vaginal delivery, allowing an informed maternal choice. In contrast, without such strict selection, intrapartum cesarean section accounts for a greater proportion of maternal and perinatal morbidity and maternal morbidity than planned vaginal / cesarean delivery.</p>
<p>Therefore, national guidelines and criteria for the management of term breech presentation should include: obstetric history, estimated fetal weight &lt;3,800 g, non-hyper extended head on ultrasound, no evidence of antenatal fetal compromise and adequate mother pelvic size.</p>
<p>While the use of pelvimetry remains a matter of debate, recent studies confirmed findings of an older randomized trial suggesting that adequate pelvic size measurement may improve the selection of delivery route.</p>
<p>Hence register studies support this view of a selection quality for candidate to vaginal breech delivery by the low conversion rate of vaginal to CS breech delivery.</p>
<p><strong><u>How might we maximize patient benefit from a safe external cephalic version attempt?</u></strong></p>
<p>Current guidelines recommended external cephalic version (ECV) to limit the increase in elective CS rate for cases of term breech presentation. The true impact of ECV may first be limited by the timely detection of breech presentation and contraindications. Such screening should allow timely ECV at 36 weeks’ gestation and a careful evaluation of potential underlying antenatal risks, considering obstetric history, estimated fetal weight/growth and potential gestational disorders before ECV.</p>
<p>Indeed, pregnancy with obstetrical factors (such as GDM) and fetal factors (such as footling breech or SGA), may particularly benefit from successful ECV at 36 weeks to avoid subsequent induction of labor with breech presentation.</p>
<p>Retrospective population based studies also highlighted that successful ECV for breech presentation are at increased risk for CS delivery, as compared with spontaneous cephalic presentation. Therefore, practitioners should understand that successful ECV is not the end of breech presentation management.</p>
<p><strong><u>Towards an individualized approach</u></strong></p>
<p>The mode of delivery and breech presentation is only the tip of the iceberg (fig 2). It implies that planned cesarean section without understanding the underlying obstetrical condition cannot fully prevent increased perinatal morbidity associated with breech presentation. It also means that without strict selection, the higher perinatal morbidity after planned ECV and vaginal delivery suggested by some studies (as opposed to planned cesarean section) may become a .</p>
<p>At 36 weeks of pregnancy, one must thoroughly consider obstetric history and fetal weight estimates based on clinical and ultrasound examinations, despite the large confidence interval of all available algorithms for producing such estimates, we advise that pelvic examination should be performed. Although radiologic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pelvimetry is not universally recommended, its contribution provides very useful criteria to rule out pathological pelvic contraction for the preselection of planned modes of delivery and the counselling of women.</p>
<p>Secondly, timely ECV should be proposed in light of the eligibility and possible benefit.</p>
<p>The experience of the health care team/ availability of clinical skills is important.</p>
<p>Thirdly, regardless of the planned mode of delivery, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy is needed and subject to decision-making based on the continuous evaluation of risk factors, medical history, possible underlying disorders and comorbidities.</p>

<p>This is not a new project, by any means, rather one of my long-running favorite projects – the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>. INCF has partcipated each year since 2011, and I have been the main org admin on ONCF’s behalf for all but the two first years.</p>



<p>I described GSoC in some detail in Swedish back in 2014 when I guest-blogged at Tidningen Curie (<a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/gastbloggar/malinsandstrom/en-snart-passerad-sommar-av-kod/">“En snart passerad sommar av kod”</a>). Many of the things I named as positive then are still true today;  it is in many ways a <em>fantastically</em> fun project to work with. The students are smart, motivated and enthusiastic over having the possibility to contribute to projects and tools that are needed and useful.  The mentors get a lot of development done for the price of regular mentoring, and the projects get new contributors – many continue to involve their students one way or another after the paid period, and some of them come back as mentors for the same project they started on. One former student, from 2018,  is even my co-org-admin! (Hi, <a href="https://arnab1896.github.io/">Arnab</a>!) As mentoring organization, we get the joyous task of helping our community members help each other; many of the participating software tool projects are developed an maintained on small or no funds by the researchers themselves. We know how many small gaps there are that need to be bridged to make community tools better, faster, and smarter. And all the developed and inproved resources are openly accessible for everyone to pick up and continue working on or extend. </p>



<p>January, now,  is the run up period – we have <a href="https://neurostars.org/t/incf-call-for-community-project-proposals-and-mentors-for-gsoc-2021-deadline-for-expressions-of-interest-january-15/17865">a call out for project suggestions and mentors</a>, and responses have just started trickling in. Usually the mentors/project owners come to us with specific, well-thought-out and well described ideas, and sitting at the other end reading them all is a great experience – it is a veritable fountain of scientific and technical creativity, and one of the high points of my year. Projects that are well scoped and described – nearly all the submissions – end up on our official Project Ideas List and form the most important part of our application (I think, nobody knows exactly what Google looks for). As soon as that list goes public, around the end of January/start of February, mentors start interacting with potential students, working out the students’ project proposals. But slowly. The real explosion in activity comes when Google announces the year’s accepted organizations, this year that announcement goes out on March 9 (usually pretty late in the day, since it is on US-compatible time). It is always a very nervous day.  </p>



<p>This year, Google has reshaped the program a bit, shortening the time spent coding and lowering the (high) threshold for participation. Which means we will get more students who are not hard core coders (yet) and need some support – which we as mentoring organization will be partly responsible for providing – and also the mentors and their community – all student projects start with an official community bonding period (genius idea). I distinctly remember being new to coding as a student, and hope that experience will help me be helpful. </p>

<p>It seems I have a lot going on this coming year, I was a bit surprised myself when I started counting out my projects and landed at 9 long before I was done. Here is a status update:</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1684">2021 projects, #1: social media critique</a><br />I have the book, digital now and paper on the way, but have not started yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/30/2021-projects-2-veganuary/">2021 projects, #2: Veganuary</a><br />Going well so far; veganizing breakfast was easy, quick work-from-home lunches depend mostly on what we ate the days before so they will veganize themselves in time. Dinner requires more adjustment, since I have two kids – relativley open to eating new things, but one of them is probably a supertaster. Most of my #veganuary updates will be posted on Instagram.</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1697">2021 projects, #3: test-knit a cardigan</a><br />Also going well, I have the yoke almost done. The only annoyance is my cable keeps unscrewing from the right hand needle, regardless of how hard I screw it stuck. Again and again. </p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-4-learn-something-new/">2021 projects, #4: learn something new</a><br />This project hit an unanticipated rock in the road – the Swedish AI course I joined, “Elements of AI”  in Swedish translation, which looked good at the start, turned out to be a disappointment. Weirdly formulated  problem statements – I supposed they aimed to be inclusive give simple questions, but missed the mark – and finnicky automated-response-checkers. Translation was great, though. The only term not well translated was Data Scientist.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-5-community-managers-resilience/">2021 projects, #5: community managers &amp; resilience</a><br />Community managers at large have been a positive force for good, this year. In late January, there will be a Community Manager Appreciation Day, themed “resilience”. Expect some posts on that.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-6-scouting-leadership/">2021 projects, #6: scouting &amp; leadership</a><br />We joined in late November, so the only scout meetings we have had so far took place on Zoom. But there are plans to be outside and DO things, which I look much forward to. And I am psyched to be a parent-leader; I have <em>so</em> many ideas for keeping the kids busy and entertained. </p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/">2021 projects, #7: books</a><br />This will be the most work, likely. All books in the apartment need to get sorted, a fair amount will be packed in boxes, and the equal amount of books will come up from the cellar storage. All books to be scanned and registered. And I need to go through, sort and tag all my 700 e-books.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/">2021 projects, #8: podcasts</a><br />This project, I think, will be a main contributor to keeping me sane. I plan to take long walks and listen to interesting things. I have already found a few new favourites to add to my listening rota (which so far is mainly EscapePod): the ORIONScience podcast, and the Svenskan i Samhället (Swedish in Society) podcast.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/">2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything</a><br />This is by far not my only upcoming work project. There will be Google Summer of Code, there will be INCF Working Groups, and literature search for the INCF Infrastructure Committee. And meeting new people, helping some people connect and collaborate… I will likely not have a boring moment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/">2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything</a></h4>

<p>This project is work-focused, but will surely frame my thinking and actions also beyond work. My latest work strategy meeting can pretty much be summed up in one sentence: RRIDs on <em>everythin</em>g (and if it doesn’t have an RRID yet, get one for it).</p>



<p>RRID is short for Research Resource ID, and is a type of identifier to inambiguously identify, mention and cite a research resource, taken broadly. Web portals, software tools, antibodies, cell/animal lines or bacterial strains. RRIDs grew out of the Research Resource Identification Initiative, whose key members also are part of the INCF community in the US, ands was launched as a recommendation in 2014, re-emphasized by successful trial results published in 2016.</p>



<p>If you have ever experienced an everyday name or identity collision – a similarly named classmate, a repeatedly mis-dialed phone number, getting emails meant for another person, having a neighbour or office colleague who gets your mail and you get theirs – you should already have a hunch about why identifiers are important, and what not having them means.</p>



<p>Simply put, identifiers give us a way to be more specific and precise than mere words can offer. There are existing identifiers for research papers (DOI:s, since old, ~2000s), people (ORCID:s, even older, Oct 2012), and research institutions (ROR in 2019, GRID in 2015). And since even longer, books have identifiers. ISBN, the International Standard Book Number, was published in <strong>1970</strong> as international standard ISO 2108. And identifiers typically are compact strings of characters, put together after a pattern, because you want them to be easy to use AND computer-readable .</p>



<p>But the existing set of identifiers did not cover all of research nearly enough: there were (and are still) problems with, for example: exactly and unambigously stating which antibod(ies) from which producer(s) you actually used. Or which breed of lab rat. Citing tools and specifying transparently which tools you use. Hence, RRIDs were conceived, and there is an ongoing campaign to get them broadly used.</p>



<p>Identifiers are useful on their own, but there are broader aspects – if you want to make science FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Internoperable, Reusable), <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dint_a_00025">identifiers will be a part of your toolset</a>. They also need to be machine readable, because computers deal with thousands of data points a lot better than most humans do, and it would be nice to be able to automate identification and information gathering. They need to be persistent, i.e stay the same and not start meaning something different regardless of how tech develops. They also need to be resolveable – there needs to be a service at the other end, likely a database – storing the associated info.</p>



<p>The idea is, if everything has an RRID, it doesn’t matter if information is spread out like a box of dropped tooth picks all over the formal and informal scientific digital landscape in preprints, papers, posters, websites, blog posts, social media – it is still findable, as long as it is digital, attached to a PID, and available for indexing. So my mission is, simply, to find out which important-to-neuroinformatics research objects are not yet findable, and change that.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05905-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">The micropolitics of implementation; a qualitative study exploring the impact of power, authority, and influence when implementing change in healthcare teams</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can healthcare implementation be understood through a political lens?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogers et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. explored the effect of micropolitics, the use of power, authority, and influence, on implementation processes in the healthcare context. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare teams, healthcare professionals have discipline-specific priorities and expectations. Thus, multidisciplinary teams must reach agreements in spite of their divergent organizational priorities.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rogers et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. sought to address how micropolitics influences implementation processes by utilizing a multiple case study design and a theoretical framework.</span></p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-12230 aligncenter" height="368" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/micropolitics-of-healthcare-300x156.jpg" width="707" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The qualitative analysis revealed that implementing change is an inherently political process in the healthcare context. Hierarchical systems were exemplified in both case studies; however, the impact of the hierarchy differed across settings. The first theme of the micropolitics of implementation was utilizing the hierarchy to exert influence. The physicians were identified as important “role models” in implementing change. Senior managers served similarly to senior physicians, though their role was perceived to have less influence on staff engagement. Additionally, clinical nurse managers played an important role as the “middle-man” to liaise between the disciplines. In one instance, the clinical nurse manager’s rejection of the intervention led to a lack of information amongst the team, negatively impacting implementation. In each instance, the hierarchy structure impacted how team members related to the intervention.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately le</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second theme that emerged was how traditional power structures constrained implementation. Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately leading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention. Furthermore, the hierarchy of the team impacted how the staff viewed the intervention relating to their influence on the decision. While some staff felt the intervention offered them an opportunity to participate as members of the team and to “have a voice”, which led to more consistent attendance throughout implementation, other members felt the implementation was irrelevant to their role, resulting in poor adoption of the intervention. Finally, silo working, or working in isolation rather than collaboration, negatively affected the dissemination of information within the medical team, limiting engagement. Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">us, the hierarchy also impacted cross-disciplinary interactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings ultimately apply the micropolitical concepts of power, authority and influence to the healthcare context in hopes of providing insight on how to develop more appropriate implementation strategies. The thematic analysis and knowledge of the “everyday politics” of healthcare will certainly help develop a framework for successful implementation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of the global opioid crisis, developing safe care parameters for people who use substances is essential. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urbanoski et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. conducted focus groups with a variety of individuals who use or used substances, focusing on the patient perspective of safe primary care. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants were recruited from peer-run organizations that provide support and advocacy to people who use substances. Participants were an average of 42.5 years, half identified as female and one quarter as Indigenous. Following several rounds of focus groups focused around the statement “I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”, the participants produced a cluster map as a “comprehensive and meaningful” representation of the data. The clusters can be summarized as the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act to prevent stigma: Don’t treat me like crap!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This cluster deals with the external and internal stigma associated with substance use.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey I’m human. Treat me right!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Similar to Cluster 1, this cluster reflects the importance of humane and compassionate care.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uphold professional standards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cluster 3 primarily focuses on professional competency, particularly around pain management and how providers can recognize patients’ experience of pain as legitimate.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you care about me? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can physicians develop trust with their patients? This cluster speaks to the importance of personalized care, continuity of care, and developing rapport. </span></i></li>
<li><i>Maintain my confidentiality in a welcoming and comfortable environment</i>. Cluster 5 articulates concerns around the waiting room environment and clinic practices. Participants described crowded waiting rooms and limited privacy in conversation as chief stressors.</li>
<li><i>Be a champion for advocacy</i>. How can primary care providers address issues of accessibility and support to improve perceived safety in accessing care? Cluster 6 states examples such as allowing the presence of advocates or friends at appointments, providing care in discrete locations, etc.</li>
<li><i>Acknowledge and accommodate my needs and circumstances</i>. Cluster 7 identifies how circumstances impact plans of care. Participants indicated the desire for increased forgiveness of missed appointments, understanding fear of being criminalized for the disclosure of drug use, and more. Each of these statements asked primary care providers to recognize the “structural conditions” that impact accessing healthcare.</li>
<li><i>Don’t red flag me: Recognize addiction as a health issue</i>. The final cluster addresses how a physician’s view of addiction as a health issue, not a criminal behavior, helps people who use substances feel safe in seeking care.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these focus groups provide a starting point for improving the delivery of compassionate primary care to people who use substances. This model provides concrete, patient-centered suggestions for improving primary care processes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work focuses on the most effective method to competitively map human contamination from ancient faunal DNA with reduced losses of data, thus acting as a beneficial tool within ancient DNA research. This was achieved through the sequencing of genomic data from 70 ancient and historical mammalian specimens, including an ancient favorite: the wooly mammoth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia’s sexual minority adult population (LGBTQIA+) are difficult to estimate as the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not publish or collect any data on sexual identity. Therefore, this work attempted to provide this estimate and fill the gaps in the latest census data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining data from multiple national surveys and population data, average prevalence rate produced an estimate of Australia’s sexual minority population – utilising data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Household, Income And Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.  It was found that Australia’s sexual minority was higher in the younger population and steadily increased with surveys conducted in later years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposing a potential cohort effect for this trend, it is suggested sexual identities can be influenced by social attitudes and the legal environment of the time. Younger cohorts have spent their formative years within a time of higher acceptance of sexual identity and the willingness to disclose one’s identity. This cohort effect has the potential to impact future population surveys and the percentage of Australia’s known sexual minority population.  </span></p>

<p>Today was the informal start of our Veganuary. I went shopping for core vegan staples and a few upcoming easy meals, and we made our first vegan lunch: vegan gyros in pita bread, with oat créme fraîche, vegetables, hummus, roasted onion flakes, and vegan feta.  Everyone was postively surprised – the vegan gyros was tender and flavourful, the fraîche was to everyone’s liking, and the feta was eerily much like the original. </p>



<p>We also discussed implementation and focus, and came to agreement: 1) major focus: sustainability and being planet friendly. No flight transports or unneccessarily long transports if local alternatives exist. 2) secondary focus: health. We might as well diversify our carbohydrates while changing things around. More beans and lentils. 3) Needs to be family compatible. The kids will sometimes get their usual fare, but will be encouraged to try alternatives.</p>



<p>In addition, I aim to take a generally more planet-friendly month, focused on re-use and DIY, aiming for second hand and pre-used where available. </p>

<p><em>How does the brain work and how can we understand it? I want to make it a habit to report some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month at the end of each year – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications.

<p>Doing experiments in neuroscience means opening Pandora’s box. On a daily basis, you’re confronted with the vexing fact that the outcome of experiments is not only slightly, but much more complex and variable than any mental model you could come up with. It is rewarding and soothing to read published stories about scientific findings, but they often become stories only because things which did not fit in were omitted or glossed over. This is understandable to some extent, since nobody wants to read 379 side-notes on anecdotal and potentially confusing observations. But it leads to a striking gap between headlines with clear messages, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by complexity when doing experiments or going through a raw dataset. It is possible to overcome this complexity by nested analysis pipelines (‘source’ extraction, unsupervised clustering, inclusion criteria, dimensionality reduction, etc.) and to restore simplicity. But the confusion often comes back when going back to the raw, unreduced data, because they contain so much more complexity.</p>



<p>In this year’s write-up, I want to address this complexity of the brain from the perspective of self-organized systems, and I will try to point out lines of research that can, in my opinion, contribute to an understanding of these systems in the brain.</p>



<p><strong><em>Complex systems</em></strong></p>



<p>Two years ago, I have been writing about the limitation of the human mind to deal with the brain’s complexity, and the reasons behind this limitations (<a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/entanglement-of-temporal-and-spatial-scales-in-the-brain-but-not-in-the-mind/">Entanglement of temporal and spatial scales in the brain but not in the mind</a>). This year, I again have been thinking quite a bit about these issues. During summer, in the bookshelf of a friend, I noticed the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel)">Jurassic Park</a>, which my friend, to my surprise, recommended to me. The book, more so than the movie, tells the story of how a complex system – the Jurassic Park – cannot be controlled because of unexpected interactions within the system that were thought to be separated by design. This perspective is represented in the book by a smart-ass physicist who had worked on chaos theory. He not only predicts that all will be going downhill from the start, but also provides lengthy rants about the hubris of men who think they can control complexity.</p>



<p>This threw me back to the days when I studied physics myself, actually also with a focus on complex systems: non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, chaos control and biophysics. So, with some years in neuroscience behind me, I went back to the theory of complex systems. I started to go through a very easy-to-read book on the topic by Melanie Mitchell: <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/2/reviews/3.html">Complexity: A Guided Tour</a>. <a href="https://melaniemitchell.me/">Melanie Mitchell</a> is herself a researcher in complexity science. She did her PhD work with Douglas Hofstadter, famously known for his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>. Mitchell summarizes the history and ideas of her field in a refreshingly modest and self-critical way, which I can only recommend. As another bonus point, the book was published in 2009, just before deep learning emerged as a highly dominant idea – which also suppressed and overshadowed many other interesting lines of thought.</p>

<p>For example, Mitchell brings up John von Neumann’s idea of self-organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, Douglas Hofstadter’s work, Alan Turing’s idea of self-organization in simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern">reaction-diffusion systems</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine">cybernetics</a> movement around Norbert Wiener, Hermann Haken’s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)">Synergetics</a>, and Stephen Wolfram’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science">A New Kind of Science</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of these ideas about complex systems were intellectually inspiring, and certainly influenced many people; but at the same time they often did not really hold their promise and did not have a similar real-work impact outside of the philosophical realm, in contrast to for example the development of semiconductors or the backpropagation in neuronal networks. On one side, ideas around self-organization like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">Autopoiesis</a> concept invented by Montana and Varela were riddled with ill-defined concepts and often connected to ideas like “emergence”, “cognition” or “consciousness” in very vague ways. On the other side of the spectrum, many very influential researchers like Douglas Hofstadter or Stephen Wolfram had a very strong mathematical background and therefore were fascinated by beauty and simplicity rather than truely high-dimensional chaos. I think it’s fascinating to proof that a cellular automaton like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is Turing-complete (i.e., it is a universal computer), but wouldn’t a practical application of such an automaton be more convincing and useful than a theoretical proof?</p>



<p>It is therefore tempting for an experimentalist and natural scientist to simply trash the entire field as verbal acrobatics that will not help to understand complex systems like the brain. However, in the next section I’d like to make the point why I think the concept of self-organized systems should still be considered as potentially central when it comes to understanding the brain.</p>



<p><strong><em>Self-organized systems</em></strong></p>



<p>Over the last years, I have become more and more convinced that complex systems cannot be easily understood by simply describing their behavior. Even for very simple complex phenomena like the Lorenz equations, where the behavior of the system can be described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor">strange attractors</a>, this description can only provide a low-dimensional description which allows to predict the behavior of the system, but it does not tell much about the generative processes underlying the respective phenomena.</p>



<p>Low-dimensional descriptions of brain activity are one of the most active areas of current research in neuroscience. This can range from a description of brain dynamics in terms of oscillatory regimes, to default mode networks of the human brain, or more recently to attempts to break down the population activity of thousands of neurons into a low-dimensional manifold. These are beautiful  descriptions of neuronal activities, and it is certainly useful to study the brain with these approaches. But does it provide us with a real understanding? From one perspective, one could say that such a condensed description (if it exists, which is not yet clear) would be a form of deep understanding, since any way to compress a description is some sort of understanding. But I think there should be a deeper way of understanding that focuses on the underlying generative processes.</p>



<p>Imagine you want to understand artificial neural networks (deep networks). One way would be to investigate information flows and how representations of the input evolve across different layers and become less similar to the input and more similar to the respective target label. This is an operative and valuable way to understand of what is going on. In my opinion, it would however allow for a deeper understanding to simply bring up the very organizing principles which underlie the generation of the network: back-propagation of errors during learning, the definition of the loss function and the deep feed-forward network architecture.</p>



<p>Similarly, I think it would be equally more interesting in neuroscience to understand the generative and organizing principles which underlie the final structure of the brain, instead of studying the representations of information in neuronal activity. It is clear that a part of the organization of the brain is encoded in the genome, for example as guidance cues for axonal growth or as the program of sequential migration of cell types, and in addition also the coarse specific connectivity across different cell types. However, the more flexible, and possibly also more interesting part, is probably not organized by an external designer (like a deep network) and also not directly organized by the genome. In the absence of an external designing instance, there must be self-organization at work.</p>



<p>Once we accept that this part of the generative principles underlying the brain structure and function is self-organization, it becomes immediately clear that it might be useful to get inspired by complexity science and the study of self-organized systems. This connection between neuroscience is probably evident to anybody working on complex systems, but I have the impression that this perspective is sometimes lost by systems neuroscience and in particular experimental neuroscience.</p>



<p><strong><em>Self-organizing principles of neuronal networks: properties of single neurons</em></strong></p>



<p>I believe that the most relevant building blocks of self-organization in the brain are single neurons (and not molecules, synapses or brain areas). A year ago, I have argued why I think this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective (<a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">Annual report of my intuition about the brain (2019)</a>), and I argued why would be interesting to understand the objective function of a single cell: so-to-speak the single-cell specific generative principle that underlies the self-organization of biological neuronal networks.</p>



<p>Realistically speaking, this is too abstract a way of exploring biological neurons. What would be a less condensed way to describe the self-organizing principles underlying single neurons that are analogous to back-propagation and loss functions for deep networks? I would tend to mention main ingredients: First, the principles that determine the integration of inputs in a single neuron. Second, the principles that determine the way that neurons connect and modify their mutual connections – which is basically nothing but plasticity rules between neurons. I am convinced that the integrative properties of neurons and the plasticity rules of a neuron when interacting with other cells are the main ingredients that are together the self-organizing principles of neuronal networks.</p>



<p>This is a somewhat underwhelming conclusion, because both plasticity rules and integrative properties of neurons have been studied very intensely since the 1990s. The detour of this blog post about self-organization basically reframes what a certain branch of neuroscience has been studying anyway. However, in addition it makes – in my opinion – also clear why the study of population dynamics and low-dimensional descriptions of neuronal activity aims at a different level of understanding. And it makes the point that the deepest understanding of biosimilar networks can probably be achieved by studying the aspects of self-organizing agents, plasticity rules and single-cell integrative properties, and not by studying the pure behavior of animals or neuronal networks.</p>



<p><strong><em>Studying self-organized neuronal networks and plasticity rules</em></strong></p>



<p>So, how can we study these principles of self-organized agents? Unfortunately, the last 30 years have made it quite clear that there is not simply a single universal plasticity rule. Typical plasticity rules (spike-time dependent plasticity; fire-together-wire-together; NMDA-dependent potentiation) usually explain only a small fraction of the variance in the experimental data and can often be only studied in very specific experimental conditions, and in most cases only in slice work. Usually, the conditions of the experiment (number of presynaptic action potentials to induce plasticity, spike frequency, etc.) are tuned to achieve strong effects, and absence of effects in other conditions are not systematically studied and often go unreported. In addition, plasticity rules <em>in vivo</em> seem to be somewhat different. Neuromodulation and other state-dependent influences might affect plasticity rules in ways that make them almost impossible to study systematically. In addition, it is very likely that there is not a single plasticity rule that governs the same behavior across all all neurons, since diversity of properties has been shown in simulations to provide robustness to neuronal circuits at many different levels. And evolution has would be a fool not to make use of this property that is so easy to achieve – evolution does not care about being hard to reverse engineer. This however makes it merely impossible (although still very valuable!) to dissect these principles systematically in experiments.</p>



<p>That is why I think that simulations – not experiments – could be the best starting point for understanding these self-organized networks.</p>



<p>There is indeed a large body of work going into this direction. If you google for “self-organizing neuronal networks”, you will find a huge literature which goes back to the 60s and is often based on very simplistic models of neurons (still heavily inspired by condensed matter physics), but there are also some interesting more recent papers that directly combine modern plasticity rules with the idea of self-organization (e.g. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.10.023.2009/full">Lazar et al., 2009</a>). And there are not few computational labs that study plasticity rules and their effect on the organization of neuronal networks, which is also some kind of self-organization, e.g. the labs of <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=m0v2CxEAAAAJ">Henning Sprekeler</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=jy5yBV4AAAAJ">Claudia Clopath</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=RsHPZroAAAAJ">Tim Vogels</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&amp;user=_IxvO8QAAAAJ">Friedemann Zenke</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2HXsblgAAAAJ">Richard Naud</a>, all of them influenced by <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=dqBH37QAAAAJ">Wulfram Gerstner</a>; or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ">Sophie Deneuve</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4z7V1oAAAAJ">Christian Machens</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WpvdH0AAAAJ">Wolfgang Maass</a> – to name just few out of many people who work on this topic. I think this is one of the most interesting fields of theoretical neuroscience. However, I would be personally very satisfied to see this field shift towards a better inclusion of the self-organizing perspective.</p>



<p>To give a random example, in a study from this year, Naumann and Sprekeler show how specific non-linear properties of neurons can mitigate a well-known problem associated with purely Hebbian plasticity rules (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/12/2020.02.11.944082">Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitationin the face of plasticity, 2020</a>). They basically take an experimental finding that has been made quite some time ago (pre-synaptic inhibition of the axonal boutons via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors) and builds a model that explains how this could make sense in the light of plasticity rules. This is a very valuable way of doing research, also because it takes biological details of neurons into account and gives the experimentalists a potential context and explanation of their findings. However, this approach seems to be the perspective of a designer or engineer, rather than the approach of somebody who aims at an understanding of a self-organized system. What would be an alternative approach?</p>



<p><strong><em>From engineered organization to self-organization</em></strong>  </p>



<p>I think it would be useful to take the perspective of a neuron, and in addition also an evolutionary perspective. Let’s say, a neuron with certain properties (rules on when and how to connect) joins the large pool of a recurrent network. The question which must be solved by the neuron is: How do I learn how to behave meaningfully?</p>



<p>I’d like to give an analogy on how I think this neuron should ideally behave: A human person that interacts with others in a social network, be it in real life or in the virtual world, must adjust their actions according to how they are received. Shouting loud all the time will isolate them, because they are blocking the receiving channels of others, and being silent all the time will let others equally drop the connections. To adjust the level of output and to adjust the appropriate content that will be well-received, it is crucial to listen to feedback.</p>



<p>This is what I think could be the central question from this self-organized perspective of neuronal circuits: How does the neuron get feedback on its own actions? And with feedback, I do not mean global error signals about the behavior of the organism via neuromodulation channels, but  feedback on the neuron’s action potentials and its other actions. Where does this feedback come from?</p>



<p>If we reduce the complex network to a single cell, we can immediately see the answer to this question, the feedback comes from the external world. A spike of this “neuron” has a direct impact on the world, and the world in return acts back upon the “neuron”. It is not clear how this scales up to larger networks, but I think that this inclusion of the external world, as opposed to a machine learning-style input-output task, could be the most important ingredient that makes the step from engineered network organizations to self-organized networks.</p>



<p>(There are many loose connections from here to reinforcement learning using learning agents and also to predictive processing, but let’s not go into that here.)</p>



<p><strong><em>Conclusion and summary</em></strong></p>



<p>The conclusions of this write-up might sound trivial from some perspective; and again others might say that these ideas will not lead anywhere, similar to many previous suggestions in the field of complex self-organized systems.</p>



<p>I’m glad to become convinced otherwise, but today I think that a very promising way to achieve a deep understanding of the brain could consist of the following ingredients, as motivated above:</p>



<p>1) To regard the brain as a at least partially self-organized network,</p>



<p>2) To use simulations together with evolutionary algorithms to explore the generative / self-organizing principles,</p>



<p>3) To consider properties and actions on the level of single neurons as the main parameters that can be modified during this evolutionary process and</p>



<p>4) To include an external world to transition from an externally organized to a self-organized system.</p>

<p>Podcasts have been growing quickly in numbers during the last years, and I didn’t really clue in to that until I re-joined LinkedIn in the middle of the year for other work purposes – and suddenly, it seemed whoever I checked and followed had a podcast. Or had just started a podcast – it is apparently the Professional Thing To Do in the 2020’s.</p>



<p>Currently, my life mostly lacks quiet time to sit down (or go for walks) and listen to podcasts, so I have been amassing an ever-growing long list of interesting, possible podcasts to listen to; it is very low effort to follow more podcasts now that they are available on Spotify.</p>



<p>I used to listen to a lot of podcasts some years ago, when the kids were still small enough to need daily long walks in a stroller. It was mainly <a href="https://escapepod.org/about-us/">EscapePod</a> and a few different Swedish Radio pods, and a very nice podcast with some of my favourite authors chatting about different things, the <a data-id="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/" data-type="URL" href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/">SFSqueecast</a>,  but it ended long ago.</p>



<p>So, my project for 2021 is: take the looong list of podcasts I currently subscribe to, and trial them to see which ones are worth keeping long term.  I have one nominee for the list already, the <a href="https://www.orion-openscience.eu/publications/training-materials/201902/podcasts">ORION Open Science podcast</a>.</p>

<p>I own a lot of books. Nowadays, I mostly buy Kindle books, since the bookshelves had to go when we got twins. I now own about 700 books on Kindle, of which 400+ are read at least once. This is the result of one single Twitter account (mostly), <a href="https://twitter.com/sfsignal">@SFSignal</a>, that tweets sales of SF and other fantastic fiction, under the tag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sff_eBookDeal?src=hashtag_click">sff_eBookDeal</a>. Some of the books go for as low as $1-$2, and that’s where the majority of my digital library comes from.</p>



<p>I also own a lot of actual, physical SFF books. Nearly all paperbacks. We used to have a high shelf for my books along the walls of our entry hall, but when we switched apartments a few years back, that had to go. It swallowed at least 150 books, that now lying in boxes in the cellar storage.</p>



<p>When we started the Matmolekyler project, we started out with buying useful books. I have a bunch of those in my bookshelves (including some I got myself, or as gifts: several books by HaroldMcGee, two priced *signed* books by Gordon Shepherd). Since then, I try to buy food-science-related books when I find them at reaonable prices. That collection is now about 50 books.</p>



<p>I also went through a period where I was thinking a lot about food and cooking history, so I tried to find some of the earlier real cookbooks (and school household training books) from the early 1900s. There are typically cheap and abundant at used book stores, so by now I have quite a few. Including one I got at a museum, which is a copy of a 1800s cookbook along with a companion book written by a historian). And a set of two old ~1800s household encyclopedias in a new edition from a Swedish agricultural society (I had to order them special and pick them up in person). Let’s say, another 40 or so books.</p>



<p>For 2021, I hope to rearrange all of our (mine, really) bookshelves so that I have more SFF books accessible (since I want to re-read them anyway). I hope to inventory and index all books, and maybe even get rid of some. I need to find some good book inventory software – I have Goodreads but haven’t really used it for sorting books yet.</p>

<p>My kids wanted to join the Scouts, so we put them in the queue for our local Scoutkår, Adolf Fredriks. Kids whose parents agree to help with (co)leading get boosted higher in the queue, and I do have earlier experience, so I indicated my willingness to help. And then we waited.</p>



<p>Not for long, it took maybe a month or so. No regular meetings were held, but we tried to meet up on Zoom each week (and if you have ever wondered why Zoom etiquette is needed, try meeting with a group of eight-year-olds and try to get them to follow a program).</p>



<p>There have been no outside activities yet, but that is our likely next step, so we have gone over what outdoor equipment we have and what we need. Black Friday let us buy two good sleeping bags for a good price. The kids’ great-grandmother gave them each a good outdoor backpack. I found myself hiking boots, outdoor trousers and a decent size backpack (~50 l ) on sales. Rainjackets, -trousers and boots/waterproof shoes we already have, because of Stockholm winters. We also got two pairs of skates and helmets for the kids, because one of the possible future activities is the skating ice frozen in the nearby Vasaparken, arranged every winter season by the local authorities.</p>



<p>So for the next year at least, I will be the co-leader of a troop of 8-year-old scouts (who will turn 9 during the year).  I have so many ideas for fun stuff to do, based on my own years in the Mjölby scoutkår at home.</p>

<p>The CMX holiday letter states: “<em> I just reviewed the data with the research team and one thing is crystal clear: community has become an irreplaceable part of business. In a year where a lot of businesses struggled, and there were many layoffs, community teams actually grew. And companies of all sizes, in all industries, are going to be investing in community in a big way next year</em>.”</p>



<p>I have a standing alert for community-related position ads on LinkedIn, and see clearly a parallell increase in community positions offered in science &amp; academia.  Where ads earlier have been implicit about the community aspects, hiding it under terms such as ‘field knowledge’, nearly everyone knows and admits to some degree that in academia, it is impossible to succeed without community support. It is built into the system that your peers will (hopefully) acknowledge you and lift your work up – this mechanism is seen in such academic pillars as peer review, recommendation letters, and hiring committees, to name some examples.</p>



<p>Since I did my AAAS Community Fellowship in 2017, a training program that ran twice and which has now transformed into an independent organisation called CSCCE, <a href="https://www.cscce.org/">Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement</a> , I have been an active member in the community that surrounds CSCCE. We have a lot of interesting activites and projects around community management – interest groups (I’m in the Open Science SIG and lurking in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion SIG), projects (I’m in one we started in 2017, aiming to describe and pin down community manager skillsets), and Working Groups (I’m in the Community Champions WG).</p>



<p>The theme for the <a href="https://cmxhub.com/announcing-this-years-community-manager-advancement-day-theme-resilience">2021 Community Manager Advancement Day</a>, which takes place on January 25, is resilience. A very fitting theme, after this Covid year. Resilience of self, when the world stops around you; resilience of communities to chaos and changes; resilience of organizations and society – where community has a huge part.</p>

<p>I have always sought out situations where I think I could  learn something interesting. 2021 will not be different. Many of the tings I have learned over the past decade are by Brownian motion and absorption  – spend enough time in a community, you will pick up their interests. So I thought it would be a nice thing to learn something in a more structured fashion.</p>



<p>If there is one thing – something <em>not</em> Covid – which has popped up repeatedly in the space around me this year, it is AI and machine learning. Many papers with new neuro tools using deep learning and other ML approaches. That fantastic protein folding study. The Semantic Scholar search enginge’s new amazing TLDR:s of papers. And I attended a very interesting webinar on the possible applications of AI in music (I think it was a <a href="http://stockholm.ai/about/">Stockholm AI</a> event, but their event calendar is bugging out on me currently, so I can’t verify).</p>



<p>What entices me is the amazing creativity I see in many approaches – there are obviously a wide range of AI applications that I had not been able to imagine. </p>



<p>So I have signed up for two courses, one translated into Swedish – mostly to pick up the Swedish terms if they even exist yet, also because the translation is fantastic – and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone">one in English from Coursera</a>.</p>



<p>My 2020 project was to learn Python. Since I effectively started it in September, I haven’t come that far yet (I am at the NumPy stage), so this will be a continuing project in 2021. Also, I was gifted my friend Benjamin Auffart’s new book on ML in Python, the <em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FArtificial-Intelligence-Python-Cookbook-next-generation%2Fdp%2F1789133963%3F%26linkCode%3Dwey%26tag%3Dbenman1-21&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0ZSTs0sOY9ztyF5csoepmuE1rgQ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence in Python Cookbook</a></em>, so I have resources to make this another branch of the AI learning project.</p>

<p>I have knit a ton of things over the last 15 or so years, but I have never tested someone else’s pattern, yet benefited from others testing patterns I then bought and used. This is sort of the knitting world’s equivalent to peer review – you invest your input in the system and it pays back to you (eventyally and indirectly).</p>



<p>I decided to start off easy, so when my friend Helena (who designs and knits <a data-id="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/helena-fredenbergs-ravelry-store/patterns" data-type="URL" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/helena-fredenbergs-ravelry-store/patterns">awesome and pretty complex sweaters</a> and hats) sent out a call for testers of a new cardigan, the Gunhild cardigan, I hopped on. In thick, wooly Alafoss Lopi – a much quicker knit than what she usually designs, and much esier as a starting point.</p>



<p>The test knit came out beutifully – exactly the right number of rows and stiches measured over 10 x 10 cm (the standard way; each pattern has/should have this info). But it required cable needles, and despite more than a decade of hoarding needles, I didn’t have enough of that kind in that precise size.</p>



<p>Ordering stuff online just before Christmas is no fun, but I found a new-to-me Swedish company that had the right needles and order the most expedited freight option. Then an excruciating week of waiting, before they finally arrived late last night. Which puts this project sqarely into 2021!</p>

The brain of a monkey, mouse, marsupial, monotreme, mosquito, or mollusk? Or <i>C. elegans</i> with its 306 neurons? “Yeah yeah, we get the point,” you say, “stop being so sarcastic and cynical.

<p>There is an international movement, started in the UK and calling themselves <a href="https://veganuary.com/">Veganuary</a>, who aim to inspire people to go vegan for a month, on a try. Internationally, it is big, with more than a million people in total signed up since 2014. In Sweden, it is probably still more of a fringe movement – but still involving tens of thousands of people –  supported by Djurens Rätt.</p>



<p>I have signed up for the international version. I already have a general ongoing ‘project’ to eat more vegetables, both in larger amounts and more varieties, so this should fit right in. I am mostly doing this for climate reasons, so expensive imported-by-flight ingredients are out. </p>



<p>I’ll be doing this in conjunction with needing to cook for and feed two kids, aged 8, omnivores. Wish me luck.</p>

<p><em>A message to the community from Dr. John Ngai, Director of the NIH BRAIN Initiative.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2932"></span></p>
<p>Dear BRAIN Community,</p>
<p>I am pleased to inform you that the recently authorized <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf">Omnibus</a> Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2021 provides $42.9 billion for NIH, an increase of $1.25 billion (or 1.5%) above fiscal year 2020. <strong>This appropriation includes $560 million for the NIH BRAIN Initiative</strong>, a $60 million increase over last year’s $500 million appropriation. We are deeply grateful for Congress’s strong and continuing support of our mission.</p>
<p>The spending bill includes $404 million of appropriated funds authorized in the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/cures">21st Century Cures Act</a>. The Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, allocates funding to NIH each year through 2026, for a total of $4.8 billion across all projects described in the Act. The BRAIN Initiative was one of four highly innovative scientific initiatives designated to receive multi-year funding through the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research-training/initiatives/nih-cures-innovation-plan.pdf">Innovation Fund of the Cures Act</a>, reflecting enthusiasm for the Initiative and its goals. This funding must be appropriated each year by Congress.</p>
<p>The $560 million appropriation for the NIH BRAIN Initiative includes $100 million in Cures Act funds. This legislation reflects strong bipartisan Congressional support for biomedical research, and will provide NIH with the resources needed to continue to work towards the goals in BRAIN’s strategic plan, which was initially outlined by the <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdf"><em>BRAIN 2025 report</em></a> and recently updated and enhanced through the BRAIN 2.0 <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf">neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/bns_roadmap_11_october_2019_sent_to_acd_for_oct_2019_revised_10282019_508c.pdf">neuroethics</a> reports. Importantly, this generous allocation for 2021 will accelerate the launch of two transformative projects outlined in those reports that “stand out in for their importance to human health and technical viability,” specifically: $40 million for the Human Brain Cell Atlas and $20 million for the Armamentarium for Brain Cell Access. Collectively, this funding will help accelerate BRAIN’s mission to develop and apply innovative tools and neurotechnologies, as well as to support researchers as they seek new ways to treat, cure, and ultimately prevent brain disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to the increased funds for the BRAIN Initiative, the Omnibus Bill:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides $1.25 billion, available until September 2024, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally;</li>
<li>increases funding by $300 million, to a total of $3.12 billion in fiscal year 2021, for <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Disorders/Alzheimers-Related-Dementias">Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research</a>;</li>
<li>includes no less than $270 million for the <a href="https://heal.nih.gov/">HEAL Initiative</a> targeted at opioid misuse and addiction, and expands the uses of these funds to include research related to stimulant misuse and addiction;</li>
<li>directs NIH to require its grantees to notify it when key personnel are removed for concerns of harassment, an essential step toward addressing the findings of the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/sexual-harassment-in-academia">2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on sexual harassment in academia</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

</ul>
<p>The spending bill will fund the government until the end of the current fiscal year on September 30, 2021.</p>

"The Board assesses that there are no scientifically acceptable explanations for why the notified researchers have fabricated research results in the manner that has occurred in the notified articles. Raw data also does not support the reported results. [..]
In summary, the Board finds therefore that the notified researchers have been guilty of misconduct in research."

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/22/our-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2020/">Our Ten Most Popular Posts Of 2020</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>This year has been like no other. The coronavirus pandemic has affected pretty much all aspects of our lives — so it’s no surprise that psychological research looked a bit different in 2020. At <em>Research Digest</em>, we’ve examined much of this emerging work on the effects of the pandemic, from studies exploring the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">process of psychological recovery</a> to those looking at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/">how to cope with the new reality of home working</a>.</p>



<p>But we’ve also tried to continue providing the broad coverage of psychology research that our readers have come to enjoy. And as we look back at our most popular posts of the year, it’s clear these stories about the human experience continue to educate and entertain, even in the midst of this <em>annus horribilis</em>.</p>



<span id="more-41086"></span>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>10) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/22/heavy-coffee-drinkers-want-coffee-a-lot-more-than-they-actually-like-it/">Heavy Coffee Drinkers Want Coffee A Lot More Than They Actually Like It</a></strong></p>



<p>This study has been all over the papers this month — but we first covered it way back in June. I suspect that many people’s coffee consumption has shot through the roof during the pandemic (I know mine has), so it’s perhaps not surprising that this was one of our most read pieces of the year.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong> 9) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/">Here’s How Our Personality Changes As We Age</a></strong></p>



<p>Personality was once believed to be stable, changing very little after the age of 30 or so. But recent work shows that our personalities actually shift throughout our lives. This study examined how the “Big Five” personality traits of tens of thousands of people changed through middle age and into older age.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>8) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">Cold Days Can Make Us Long For Social Contact — But Warming Up Our Bodies Eliminates This Desire</a></strong></p>



<p>The idea that temperature can affect our social perceptions — that being physically warm leads us to feel “warm” towards others — is contentious. In fact, this kind of social priming research is often at the centre of controversies about psychology’s replication crisis. But this year, a study suggested one possible explanation for the inconsistencies in past work: the researchers rarely take into account the <em>ambient</em> temperature while they’re conducting their experiments.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>7) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/19/why-some-people-find-it-harder-to-drag-themselves-to-bed-at-night/">Why Some People Find It Harder To Drag Themselves To Bed At Night</a></strong></p>



<p>Why do so many of us suffer from “bedtime procrastination”? Intriguingly, it might be related to the beliefs we have about our willpower. This study found that people who think that willpower is a limited resource that needs to be replenished are <em>more</em> likely to put off going to bed on a stressful day, perhaps because they feel they need more time to recover from their day before sleeping.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>6) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/">These Two Revision Strategies Can Prepare You For An Exam Much Better Than Just Restudying Your Notes</a></strong></p>



<p>Our posts containing practical tips often attract a lot of readers, and this one was no different. Many lab-based studies have identified strategies for more effective studying — but this was a rare case of looking at these approaches in an actual educational setting.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>5) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/22/heres-how-long-distance-runners-are-different-from-the-rest-of-us/">Here’s How Long-Distance Runners Are Different From The Rest Of Us</a></strong></p>



<p>What kind of person decides to run 50 or 100km — or even more? Well, it turns out that ultramarathon runners are actually pretty similar to everyone else. They do seem to be more resilient and better at using certain emotion regulation strategies — but whether that’s the cause or consequence of being a long-distance runner remains unclear.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>4) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">How Psychology Researchers Are Responding To The COVID-19 Pandemic</a></strong></p>



<p>The start of the first lockdown feels like a lifetime ago now. But as the world was learning to adjust to new routines, many psychologists launched projects to study the effects of the crisis and to inform our response to it. We looked at several of these projects in this story in March.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/07/psychology-research-in-the-coronavirus-era-a-high-stakes-version-of-groundhog-day/">follow-up feature in July</a> didn’t receive quite the same number of readers, but to my mind was more important. This time we explored the worries voiced by many researchers that in “crisis mode”, psychologists were falling for the old methodological pitfalls that the field has long been trying to move on from.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>3) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/">Musicians And Their Audiences Show Synchronised Patterns Of Brain Activity</a></strong></p>



<p>If you cast your mind back to a time when it was possible to attend a concert, you might remember experiencing a feeling of connection with the musicians as they played. That connection can happen even at the neural level, according to a study which found “inter-brain coherence” between a musician and their audience (essentially a correlation in patterns of blood flow in the brains of performer and observer). What’s more, this synchronisation was stronger during the pieces the listeners found more enjoyable. Another study this year found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/">parents also show patterns of synchrony</a> with each other.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>2) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/">Memory Complaints Are More Common Among Older Adults With Particular Personality Traits</a></strong></p>



<p>A second story about personality and age proved popular this year. In this post, we looked at a study on the link between personality and cognitive complaints in older adults. One factor stood out as predicting <em>fewer </em>cognitive complaints: openness to experience, a trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits and a willingness to try new things.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>1) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">First-Generation University Students Are At Greater Risk Of Experiencing Imposter Syndrome</a></strong></p>



<p>The competitive nature of STEM classes at university can lead many students to feel like they are an imposter — but first-generation students seem to be at particular risk of imposter syndrome. This, only the second story that we posted in 2020, clearly struck a chord: it was the most popular post of the year.</p>

<p>That’s it from us for 2020. Thank you for reading the <em>Digest </em>this year, and we’ll see you back here in 2021!</p>

<p class="">Every night, Steven spends over an hour preparing for bed. For many of us, preparing for bed involves routines like putting on pajamas, going to the bathroom, and brushing our teeth. But for Steven, his preparation doesn’t truly begin until after he has already done these things. </p><p class="">Once Steven is ready to get into bed, he goes downstairs. He turns out the lights, locks the door, and checks to make sure the stove hasn’t been left on. But he does more than just look at the stove; he also gently touches the dials to confirm they are in the “off” position. Then, he stares at the dials for 30 seconds to convince himself that touching them didn’t accidentally move them into the “on” position—even though this seems like it would be impossible with such a light touch. </p><p class="">Finally, he goes upstairs to get into bed. But he is stopped by the thought that maybe he forgot to make sure the door was locked. </p><p class="">He thinks he remembers doing this, but the memory isn’t as clear as he would like it to be. Regardless, there’s always the chance he might not have turned the lock completely. So, he goes back to check the lock again. The short amount of time that has passed suggests maybe he should check the stove one more time, too. So he does.</p><p class="">Once he gets into bed, he immediately begins to question if he turned off the lights. Or, maybe he brushed up against the dials of the stove on his way back upstairs, unintentionally turning it back on. The uncertainty is almost unbearable, and it would only take a short walk downstairs to relieve his anxiety. Thus, he goes through the whole process again. He’ll repeat these steps about 15-20 times before finally feeling like he’s able to stay in bed and go to sleep.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>OCD symptoms</h2><p class="">Steven has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a surprisingly common condition that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30946823/" target="_blank">affects up to 3% of the general population</a>. People with OCD are plagued by persistent, intrusive thoughts called <em>obsessions</em>. The obsessions are typically linked to <em>compulsions</em>, which are acts a patient feels compelled to do in order to mitigate the distress caused by obsessive thoughts. For some, compulsions involve observable behaviors (like Steven’s stove-checking), but for others they might consist of mental acts like praying, reviewing past events, counting, etc.</p><p class="">OCD obsessions often follow common themes like: fears of contamination (e.g., by germs), a preoccupation with symmetry, taboo thoughts (e.g., pedophilia, incest), and concerns about harming oneself or others. </p><p class="">It’s important to note that people with OCD are very unlikely to actually have taboo desires, or to intentionally hurt someone. Instead, they’re tortured by the fact that these types of thoughts can even appear in their consciousness. They go to great lengths, represented by their compulsions, to try to keep the thoughts from becoming reality.</p><p class="">OCD symptoms occur on a spectrum, and the disorder can look quite different from case to case. One patient may seem to be outwardly healthy but suffer from obsessive thinking that disrupts her ability to concentrate, sleep, and maintain relationships. Another patient may be clearly debilitated by the disorder. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165310/" target="_blank">One teenage girl</a>, for example, was afraid that pinworms might enter her mouth. To ward off the danger, she stopped speaking for 10 months and shunned eating until she needed to be hospitalized.</p><p class=""> </p><h2>OCD and the brain</h2><p class="">Neuroscientists are still uncertain about what happens in the brain to cause OCD, but one popular hypothesis suggests it involves brain circuits that connect the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/frontal-lobe" target="_blank">frontal cortex</a> with a collection of structures called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia" target="_blank">basal ganglia</a>. </p>

<p class="">According to this perspective, OCD symptoms begin with activity in a part of the frontal cortex called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/orbitofrontal-cortex" target="_blank">orbitofrontal cortex</a>, or OFC. The OFC sits just above the eye sockets (aka the orbits), and has diverse functions—most of which are still poorly understood. Research, however, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9829024/" target="_blank">suggests that areas of the OFC are highly active when we notice something dangerous or threatening </a>in the environment.</p><p class="">After we recognize that a threat is present, pathways that connect the OFC to the basal ganglia are activated. The basal ganglia are best known for their role in movement, but they are also involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions. They are especially important to: facilitation of goal-directed actions, development of habitual responses, and switching to a new behavior when it’s deemed necessary. The circuitry of the basal ganglia can be divided into two opposing pathways: the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/direct-pathway" target="_blank">direct pathway</a>, which facilitates action, and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway" target="_blank">indirect pathway</a>, which inhibits it. (See <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia" target="_blank">this article</a> if you want more details on how these basal ganglia circuits work.)</p><p class="">Let’s look at how a simplified version of this OFC-basal ganglia circuit might work in a healthy individual. First, they notice something in the environment that could be identified as dangerous, and the OFC is involved in recognizing it as a potential threat. Let’s say they touch a door handle in a public restroom, which of course carries a risk of exposure to germs. The OFC interacts with the basal ganglia via the direct pathway to initiate an action to mitigate the threat. This leads to the person using a few squirts of hand sanitizer. At this point, the indirect pathway kicks in and inhibits further action.</p><p class="">In someone with OCD, the pathway from the OFC to the basal ganglia tends to be overly excitable. OCD patients are hyper-aware of things in the environment that might pose a threat, and that level of awareness is linked to high levels of OFC activity. Thus, in the OCD patient, a threat might be detected not only when they touch the door handle in a public restroom, but also when they brush up against any surface that hasn’t recently been sanitized—even if it’s a countertop in their own home.</p><p class="">This extreme vigilance is associated with over-excitation of the direct pathway. When the direct pathway is activated, the individual is prompted to clean their hands. But the high level of activity in the direct pathway drowns out the inhibitory action of the indirect pathway, and the patient has a difficult time switching to a different behavior. Additionally, each time the threat is temporarily alleviated, the individual feels a transient sense of relief—which reinforces the response. All of this leads to compulsive behavior, and the hand-washing must be repeated a number of times before the patient is satisfied.</p><p class=""> </p><h2>Not the whole story</h2><p class="">This model of OCD is supported by a wealth of studies. Some have found increased activity among the circuits mentioned above in OCD patients, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24840803/" target="_blank">others have found a reduction in that activity in response to the most common treatments</a> for OCD (which include cognitive behavioral therapy and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris" target="_blank">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a>). </p><p class=""><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/" target="_blank">More recent research</a>, however, suggests that this model is too simplistic (a common refrain in neuroscience). For example, one problem is that the OFC is not a homogenous brain area, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/" target="_blank">while some OFC regions are hyperactive in OCD, others appear to be hypoactive</a>. Additionally, research indicates that other parts of the brain (like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/amygdala" target="_blank">amygdala</a>, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hippocampus" target="_blank">hippocampus</a>, and other regions) also play important roles in the manifestation of OCD symptoms, suggesting the model outlined above is incomplete.</p><p class="">Thus, although the OFC and basal ganglia seem to play important roles in OCD, the original model describing their interaction to produce OCD symptoms is likely only part of the story. Neuroscientists hope that further research will elucidate the neural circuitry behind OCD, and lead to better ways to help patients like Steven manage a disorder that can completely upend someone’s life.</p><p class=""> </p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Menzies L, Chamberlain SR, Laird AR, Thelen SM, Sahakian BJ, Bullmore ET.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What makes for a happy family? The answer — whether you’re talking about a couple or a family with kids — is psychological “flexibility”, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301952?dgcid=rss_sd_all">according to a new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science</em>. Based on a meta-analysis of 174 separate studies, Jennifer S. Daks and Ronald Rogge at the University of Rochester conclude that flexibility helps — and inflexibility hinders — our most important relationships.</p>



<span id="more-41079"></span>



<p>The pair analysed data from 203 separate samples, comprising almost 44,000 participants in total. They homed in on measures of psychological flexibility and inflexibility within these studies (which often gathered other data, too), and how they related to measures of family and relationship functioning.</p>



<p>A psychologically flexible person is characterised by a set of attitudes and skills: they are generally open to and accepting of experiences, whether they are good or bad; they try to be mindfully aware of the present moment; they experience difficult thoughts without ruminating on them; they seek to maintain a broader perspective when faced with a challenge; they continue to pursue important goals despite setbacks; and they maintain contact with “deeper values”, no matter how stressful a day might be (so, for example, a parent confronted with a screaming child who holds the value of being a kind, compassionate parent is able to bear this in mind when choosing how to react to the child). Psychological inflexibility describes the opposite of these thoughts and attitudes, and also entails feeling judged or shameful for holding negative thoughts and feelings.</p>



<p>The pair identified a host of specific links between aspects of flexibility or inflexibility and family functioning. For example, they found that inattention to the present moment and a tendency to respond to challenging experiences in a rigid, inflexible way were linked to weaker family bonds. These factors were also linked to lower levels of satisfaction with romantic relationships, and less “adaptive” parenting, suggesting that such an inflexible parent “might have a more difficult time responding to their children’s misbehaviour in sensitive, compassionate and responsive ways.” (In contrast, greater flexibility was strongly linked to more adaptive parenting). A lack of awareness of the present moment was also associated with more shouting and violence among couples and, along with some other measures of inflexibility, to stronger feelings of insecurity in relation to the relationship.</p>



<p>It’s important to note, however, that the overwhelming majority of links were correlational, so the direction of cause-and-effect is not clear. It could be the case that consistently poor child behaviour drives parental inflexibility, for example — or that the two exacerbate each other. The researchers themselves highlight this issue, calling for longitudinal studies to explore the direction and strength of the associations that they report.</p>



<p>But Daks and Rogge also point to potential practical implications of their findings. It might not seem especially surprising that psychological flexibility has emerged as being good for relationships. But in the past, research on flexibility has tended to focus on how it enhances an individual’s wellbeing, rather than the quality of romantic or familial relationships. In revealing the links between flexibility and family functioning, the work suggests a possible target for new interventions. A form of therapy called <a href="https://contextualscience.org/act">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</a> encourages the development of flexibility, and there is plenty of evidence that it improves an individual’s own functioning, the pair notes. Perhaps, given the new results, it could help family functioning, too — especially if a parenting-focused ACT intervention were to be developed. Since links between greater psychological flexibility in parents and in their children have been reported, such an intervention might in theory have benefits that transmit down through generations.</p>

<img alt="Photograph showing a shadowy woodland scene with autumn leaves covering the ground" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/Photo-long-covid-patient-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As we celebrate the significant milestone of the first person in the UK to receive an effective vaccine against Covid-19, it is easy to forget the devastation this virus has caused for so many lives. Yet, tens of thousands of people in the UK are still battling symptoms, months after their initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Press articles and television documentaries have revealed the daily struggles of these ‘long Covid’ sufferers, but up to now, there has been little published research on the lived experience of this illness.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06001-y">new study</a><strong> </strong>by a team of Oxford University academics, who worked in collaboration with 114 people from across the UK with long Covid, has systematically explored the story of this novel disease and the challenges its sufferers face.</p>
<p>In addition to the symptoms and their effect on people’s daily lives, the research reveals significant questions about the availability and consistency of NHS care. It identifies important lessons that must be learned in order to reduce the long-term impact on individuals and their families, the healthcare system, and the wider economy.</p>
<h3><strong>What is long Covid?</strong></h3>
<p>Long Covid is the name patients gave to COVID-19 symptoms that don’t resolve within the expected 4-week time frame. The number of people who develop it is contested, since many people who had Covid-19 were not formally tested, were not admitted to hospital (or even assessed in A&amp;E) and their continuing suffering remains undocumented.</p>
<p>Importantly, long Covid can affect anyone, even working-age individuals who were previously fit and well. Symptoms are diverse and confusing. Breathlessness, overwhelming fatigue, and muscle pains are common. Many people suffer problems with attention or memory, chest pains, persistent cough, blood clots, gastric reflux, tingling sensations, rashes, and other ‘surprising’ problems.</p>
<p>Some or all of these symptoms may be due to underlying organ damage, therefore patients should be properly assessed and receive appropriate tests where needed. However, many individuals have normal basic tests e.g. blood tests and X-rays and the underlying cause for their problems remains unknown. The causes and best treatments for many are still unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>What did the study team do?</strong></h3>
<p>Led by <a href="https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh">Professor Trish Greenhalgh</a>, the study team recruited 114 patients with long Covid using social media. They facilitated individual interviews and focus groups where participants shared their experiences of the illness’ invasion of their lives and their encounters with the NHS and healthcare professionals.</p>
<h3><strong>What did the study find?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body</p></blockquote>
<p>Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body. Many people were trapped in cycles of small improvements and crashing relapses and struggled to come to terms with the uncertainty and debilitation caused by the disease.</p>
<p>One participant captured the devastating impact on his personal life and occupational prospects:</p>
<p><em>‘I wasn’t able to go back to work and then I got made redundant. I can’t even imagine how I’m going to find a new job yet. In the last week […] it’s feeling possible finally, after nearly six months, that I might one day find a new job. But my life is just nothing like it was and it’s not really the life I want, you know; I need to improve.’</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care</p></blockquote>
<p>Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care. They experienced confusion between the GP and 111 services, difficulty with remote or online consultations, a lack of continuity, and uninformed clinicians. Patients therefore often found themselves with no choice but to manipulate or seek out their own pathways for accessing care – often private or through personal contacts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety</p></blockquote>
<p>Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety. Many had experienced encounters with ignorant or disbelieving clinicians, who dismissed their concerns. For example, a near heart-breaking account recounted how the participant was so breathless he called his GP whilst lying prone on his living room floor only to be told he didn’t sound very breathless and should take medication for anxiety. However, some participants did describe empathic, warm, caring clinicians who were supportive, and helpful, listening to their stories and sharing their distress – companions in their dreadful journeys.</p>
<h3><strong>Suggested quality principles for long Covid services</strong></h3>
<p>Channeling the anger, frustration, fear, and hopelessness expressed by participants, the study team worked closely with a small group of sufferers to identify what would make for a high quality long Covid service: <strong>the ABCDEF of long Covid.</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12222" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12222 size-large" height="356" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/ABCDEF-long-covid-quality-principles-1024x569.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">ABCDEF Patient-generated quality principles for a long Covid service. Image Attribution: Prof. Trish Greenhalgh</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>These include <strong><u>A</u></strong>ccess to appropriate care that is not overly <strong><u>B</u></strong>urdensome for patients and families, with <strong><u>C</u></strong>linical responsibility held by one clinician. An individualized, multi-<strong><u>D</u></strong>isciplinary approach should be followed using <strong><u>E</u></strong>vidence-based standards with <strong><u>F</u></strong>urther development of knowledge and services in collaboration with patients.</p>
<p>As one of the authors described, ‘It’s been a humbling and emotional experience to work with such a committed group of patients with such powerful stories to tell. It’s sadly too late to change many of their experiences but hopefully, our suggestions could contribute to improvements for future long Covid patients.’</p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/19/jul-2020-att-koka-kola/">Jul 2020: att koka kola</a></h4>

<p>En av mina tidigaste julförberedelser är att koka kola. Jag vill hinna med några sorter innan jul, och det finns ingen(?) som orkar dela och slå in mer än en sats kola per helg (~100 st).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Ingen fotobeskrivning tillgänglig." src="https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131984082_10159202852743615_5419744557807913794_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=4XU4M64MGnAAX9wi4ok&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-arn2-1.xx&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=960159d35a15a057d83b06b9ea68ba68&amp;oe=60025BBC" /></figure>



<p>I år har jag hittills kokat bergamott-kola, chokladkola med lavendel, och lakritskola (ovan).</p>



<p>Till bergamott-kolan använde jag Mitt Köks recept på <a data-id="https://mittkok.expressen.se/recept/citronsmorkola/" data-type="URL" href="https://mittkok.expressen.se/recept/citronsmorkola/">citronsmörkola</a>, av Michael Hoffman, fast med finrivet bergamottskal och -saft. Det <em>viktiga</em> att tänka på när man smaksätter med citrusskal är att ha i det absolut sist, precis innan man häller upp kolan. Annars försvinner mycket av smaken.  Bäst är därför att riva skalet riktigt fint på ett zestjärn, så det inte blir märkbara bitar i kolan.</p>



<ul><li>4 dl vispgrädde</li><li>4 dl strösocker</li><li>2 dl ljus sirap</li><li>150 g smör (normalsaltat eller osaltat)</li><li>Smaksättning alt 1 – citrus<ul><li>1 st ekologisk bergamott eller annan citrusfrukt, finrivet skal + saft</li><li>1 krm salt (eller mer, om smöret var osaltat)</li><li>Saften kan blandas med övriga ingredienser i början av koket, men det rivna skalet ska blandas i allra sist.</li><li><strong>Garnering</strong>: en eller ett par sorters fint strössel, gärna mindre bitar tex minipärlor + lite flingsalt</li></ul></li><li>Smaksättning alt 2 – choklad<ul><li>2 rågade msk/ 0.5 dl bra kakao, t ex Monbana.</li><li>en halv tesked salt (eller mer, om smöret var osaltat)</li><li>en halv tesked malt kaffe</li><li>en halv tesked malt lavendelsalt</li><li>ett kryddmått anchopeppar</li><li><strong>Garnering</strong>: en eller ett par sorters fint strössel, gärna mindre bitar tex minipärlor + lite flingsalt + finrivet limeskal</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Resultatet av receptet blev så bra att jag använde samma recept som utgångspunkt till chokladkolan, men med lite ändringar och tillsatser. Viktigaste ingrediensen i chokladkolan är riktigt bra, mörk kakao (nej, <em>inte</em> Ögonkakao). Jag gillar <a href="https://www.apotea.se/monbana-chocolaterie-kakaopulver-i-metallbox-200g">den här från Monbana</a> som brukade vara omöjlig att få tag i förr, men som nu finns på apoteket. Jag tog två väldigt rågade matskedar. Sedan spetsade jag chokladsmaken med att förstärka åt lite olika håll med (pyttelite) lavendel, ancho, (pyttelite) kanel, lite salt, och lite vanligt malt kaffe. Limeskal och flingsalt ovanpå – och lite snöflingeströssel – när jag hällt upp kolan i formen.</p>

<p>Till lakrits-kolan fick jag experimentera lite mer. Jag utgick ifrån <a data-id="https://www.kokaihop.se/recept/lakritskola-3" data-type="URL" href="https://www.kokaihop.se/recept/lakritskola-3">det första receptet</a> jag hittade som nämnde lakritsstång, ett från 2011 på Koka ihop postat av Anneli i Örnsköldsvik (som angav Apoteket som receptkälla), men eftersom jag ville bli av med två hela 3dl paket grädde skalade jag upp allt med 20%. Och från tidigare år mindes jag att en lakritsstång inte riktigt räckte, så jag tog två. Sedan hade jag också i en cup (~2.5 dl) melass för att bredda lakritssmaken lite grann. Och en halv tesked salt. Det blev en gigantisk hög kola, nästan 120 rätt stora bitar (dvs ~20 bitar per dl grädde).</p>



<ul><li><s>5</s> <strong>6</strong> dl grädde</li><li><s>500</s> <strong>600</strong> gram socker</li><li><s>5</s> <strong>6</strong> msk sirap ljus</li><li><s>2</s> msk <strong>2.25</strong> msk (34ml) flytande glykos</li><li><s>50</s> <strong>60</strong> gram smör</li><li><s>50</s> <strong>2*50</strong> gram lakritsstång</li><li><strong>2.5</strong> dl melass</li></ul>



<p>Det är jättelätt att starta ett kolakok, och använder man termometer rakt igenom är det inte stressigt heller. Det är efterarbetet – skära och slå in – som tar tid och ansträngning. För kokningen väntar man bara tills det är “klart”, en dryg halvtimme på 2/3 av maxvärme, och så tar man grytan av värmen. Stektermometer som kan ligga i smeten hela tiden gör det lätt som en plätt, se till bara att den inte nuddar botten på kastrullen. Det kan vara bra att röra runt lite då och då när temperaturen börjar gå över 120-125 grader, då börjar kolan vara trög och kan bränna vid i bottnen. Särskilt viktigt är det att röra om man har kakao i kolasmeten. <br /><br />Och när är “klart”? Det varierar med hur mjuk kola man vill ha. ICA har en bra och rättvisande <a data-id="https://www.ica.se/buffe/artikel/temperatur-kola/" data-type="URL" href="https://www.ica.se/buffe/artikel/temperatur-kola/">temperatur-guide</a>, jag citerar:</p>



<ul><li>Vid 122-125°C är knäck- eller kolasmeten lagom kokt för mjuk kola.</li><li>Vid 140-145°C får man hårda kolor som är lite sega mitt i.</li><li>Vid 160°C är smeten karamellfast.</li></ul>



<p>“<strong>Mjuk kola</strong>” är inte vad jag siktar på, precis. Jag tycker den blir flottig och obehaglig. Däremot är den klart lättast att skära.<br /><br />“<strong>Hård kola</strong>” vill jag inte <em>riktigt </em>ha, men ganska nära. Vid 140-145 grader blir kolan dessutom nästan omöjlig att skära om man väntar för länge, då får man skära kvickt när den svalnat lagom mycket och inte för mycket (~10-minutersintervall).</p>



<p>“<strong>Lagom kola</strong>” – ungefär 130 grader – brukar jag sikta på. OBS att chokladkola med kakao blir hårdare än vanlig kola och behöver vara några grader mindre varm när man slutar koka den.<br /><br />Bäst blir nog resultatet när man *precis* låter kolan passera 131 grader och häller upp den genast. En stek-termometer som sitter i smeten hela tiden (men INTE nuddar botten) är som tidigare nämnts en bra hjälp. OBS också att man bör  passa på att skära kolan innan den svalnat helt. Lägg de nyskurna bitarna separat med ett par millimeters mellanrum, annars flyter de ihop (om du t ex lämnar dem över natten). OBS att chokladkola med kakao blir hårdare än vanlig kola och  behöver vara några grader mindre varm när man slutar koka den.</p>

De flesta klarade sig, men några fick jag skära isär nästa morgon. </figure>



<p>Det är bra att förbereda en form. Antingen smord eller fodrad med bakplåtspaper (INTE smörpaper), eller hängsle-och-bälten style: smort bakplåtspapper. Jag rekommenderar baksprej, det är jättesmidigt. Annars funkar neutral olja, t ex solrosolja, bra – fukta ett hushållspapper och sprid ut olja tunt över bakplåtspappret. Kolan blir lite fet på ytan (= fastnar inte längre) när den svalnat, men medan den är smält fastnar den obönhörligt i alla ytor som inte är smorda, och sitter som järnet när den stelnat. Vi har förlorat minst en tallrik på för hård (lakrits)kola som fastnat och inte ville lossna.</p>



<p>Kola kokt som jag vill ha den blir riktigt hård och svårhanterlig när den svalnar, lite som glas men förstås inte lika hett. Kokar du till ~130 grader som jag rekommenderar jag att strategiskt skära kolan tvärs över några gånger medan den svalnar, sedan skära i de halvfyllda skårorna –  eller klippa isär, jättesmidigt med bra sax – det skårade kolaflaket till ~3-4 cm breda kola-remsor, sedan skära remsorna i ca 1-1.5 cm breda bitar. De måtten blir en lagom bit för antingen<br />*    lyx-varianten: färdiga kolapapper, finns dyrt på Panduro  (59kr/50 st). Billigare på andra ställen, leta i webbaffärer som <a href="https://www.lyckasmedmat.se/bakning/6124-sweet-kitchen-godispapper-cellofan.html">Lyckasmedmat.se</a> (25kr). Eller<br />*    budget-varianten: vik ett bakplåtspapper (<em>INTE</em> smörpapper) i fyra på längden, klipp i remsor, klipp remsorna i lagom stora bitar. Prova på en kolabit innan du klipper många bitar, det går åt lite mer papper än vad man tror om man ska snurra prydliga knut-rosetter i båda ändar på kolan.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Authors submitting their work to arXiv for the first time undoubtedly have questions. What file types are accepted? What licenses are available? How to format metadata properly? And what is metadata anyway?</p>
<p>Now, arXiv’s new Author Guide offers researchers helpful tips and information throughout the submission process.</p>
<p>Authors activate the guide by simply clicking a button from their <a href="https://arxiv.org/user/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">user account page</a> or on subsequent pages of the submission process. Once launched, the guide highlights and explains elements likely to be unfamiliar to new arXiv authors — and also provides links to more detailed information in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">help section of arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_843" style="width: 1024px;"><img alt="SCreen shot of Author Guide button on user page" class="wp-image-843 size-large" height="330" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/Author-Guide-Screen-Shot--1024x330.png" width="1024" />The Author Guide can be activated from the user account page or any page of the submission process.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Initial feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Data collected regarding guide usage shows that authors who use the tool are more likely to successfully complete the submission process. In responses to a survey built into the guide, users described it as clear, helpful, user-friendly, detailed, and efficient. And, nearly three quarters of survey respondents indicated that they expected to use the Author Guide again in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><b>“The submission process was much easier than before because of the Author Guide.” </b></p>
<p><b>“I think it is a positive add-on to the submission process.”</b></p>
<p><b>“It’s very useful to speed up the submission process.”</b></p>
<p>-Anonymous survey respondents</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Some authors suggested ideas for improvements, and that feedback will be considered for future iterations of the guide.</p>
<p>arXiv aims to help make authors’ lives easier, and the Author Guide is just one feature released recently to do just that.</p>

<p><em>This week, a series of daily blog posts highlight 28 new and reissued BRAIN Initiative funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) for 2021. Today’s post summarizes four award opportunities focused on developing, improving, and advancing our understanding of neural recording, modulation, and stimulation methods in animals and humans.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2867"></span></p>
<p>The first two FOAs aim to enhance our knowledge of the brain by funding research to develop and apply tools for neural recording, modulation, and stimulation. The awards build upon one another but fund separate projects. Proposed projects should involve invasive and/ or non-invasive <em>in vivo</em> technologies useable in behaving animals (vertebrates and invertebrates), and eventually in humans. Applications should include plans to develop new large-scale recording methods, develop tools for circuit manipulation, and/ or link brain activity to behavior.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-020.html">RFA-NS-18-020</a> <strong>New Technologies and Novel Approaches for Large-Scale Recording and </strong><strong>Modulation in the Nervous System </strong>(Reissue of RFA-NS-17-003; R01)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This FOA supports proof-of-concept testing and development of new technologies and approaches for large-scale neural recording and modulation. This award encourages applicants to creatively address major challenges in this area of research. Proposed projects are expected to be high-risk and can incorporate diverse types of signaling beyond neuronal electrical activity, and may use modalities such as optical, magnetic, acoustic, and genetic recording/ manipulation. Applications are due on <strong>May 4, 2021.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-019.html">RFA-NS-18-019</a> <strong>Optimization of Transformative Technologies for Large Scale Recording and </strong><strong>Modulation in the Nervous System </strong>(Reissue of RFA-NS-17-004; U01)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This FOA aims to optimize existing and emerging technologies related to recording and modulating neural activity. Funding is intended for the iterative refinement of tools that have already gone through proof-of-concept testing (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-020.html">RFA-NS-18-020</a>). Projects can utilize various modalities for neural signal recording and modulation. This award can support hardware/ software development and the broad dissemination of tools into regular neuroscience practice. Applications are due on <strong>May 4, 2021.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Despite recent advances in neurotechnologies, we know little about how they affect the brain at a basic cellular or circuit level. The next FOA funds research to study the biological effects of novel neural perturbation technologies, or invasive and non-invasive tools that stimulate, inhibit, or modulate neural activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/PXi-wm_ICoI/">Author Interview: Loes Janssen and Marie-Louise Kullberg on the Well-being of Parents and Adolescents in COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Loes Janssen and Marie-Louise Kullberg used their ongoing Parent-Adolescent Interaction study as a baseline to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">investigate the well-being of Dutch</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">adolescents and parents</a> in April 2020, about one month after the participants were initially subject to local lockdown procedures. I spoke with the two researchers about the biggest surprise of their study, the need for diverse coping strategies, and one lesson that they hope the general public can take from their paper as lockdowns continue. </p>



<p><strong><em>How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?</em></strong></p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suddenly had to work from home and pause the data collection of our PhD research project (‘RE-PAIR’). Within the RE-PAIR project, we already collected ecological momentary assessments (EMA) on mood and parenting behaviors in healthy adolescents and their parents during the past few years. Not being involved in any data collection due to the pandemic could mean having a lot of time to write papers… However, we both like to have some variation in the types of tasks we need to do. As for many researchers from all kind of disciplines—from immunologist to historians—the beginning of March also felt as an opportunity for us, psychologists, to investigate the impact of these exceptional circumstances.</p>



<p>Within our research group, we decided to repeat the EMA to investigate the impact of the pandemic on mood and parenting in daily life, as we already had nice and complete baseline data of our families. By assessing mood and parenting at multiple moments per day, we were able to gain fine-grained insight into the impact of the pandemic on well-being in daily life.</p>



<p><strong><em>Were any of your findings particularly surprising or were the results of your study relatively in line with your expectations?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, we were partly surprised by our findings. We expected that the COVID-19 pandemic would have had a more negative impact on well-being of parents, adolescents and parenting behavior, and we only found support for this regarding negative affect of parents. We also expected that a person’s intolerance of uncertainty would predict an increase in their negative affect and a decrease in their positive affect. This was not the case in our study.</p>



<p>However, we did expect and found individual differences among our participants: for some parents, negative affect increased, while for others it remained the same or even decreased. This makes sense, since spending more time together as a family could also have positive effects for some families. Moreover, our sample consisted of a fairly healthy group of parents and adolescents, living in favorable circumstances, which might make the situation more bearable as compared to families who struggle with mental or physical health problems or living in less fortunate environments.</p>



<p><strong><em>While the struggles that the parents and adolescents in your study face tend to differ (ex. the adolescents struggled with boredom whereas the parents did not), some of the coping mechanisms (watching tv-shows and online contact with friends and relatives) were effective for both groups. Why do you think that was the case with some but not all coping mechanisms?</em></strong></p>



<p>We feel it is important to acknowledge that persons from different ages/stages in life (as parents versus adolescents in our study) cope differently with negative situations and emotions: Adolescents are in a phase that they start to spend more time with friends and being away from their family, whereas parents often like to keep the family close and, for instance, cook and dine together. Nonetheless, almost everyone brightens up from some social contact (even online) or behavioral activation (e.g. cooking, walking, painting etc.), as can be seen in the image below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18575" height="572" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/Janssen_graph-1024x572.jpg" width="1024" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>The manuscript ends with advice for policy makers regarding the “one size does not fit all” effectiveness of coping strategies. Since this study occurred in April, have you noticed any improvements to the availability and diversity of coping strategies?</em></strong></p>



<p>Within the Dutch policy to control Corona outbreaks, regulate hospital admissions and protect vulnerable people, the government emphasizes to remain healthy, also by doing sports, for instance. Also, even though the numbers of corona-infected cases increased during a few weeks the past months (Fall 2020), schools remained open. As we know from recent research as well, this is important as children and adolescent friendships predict resilient functioning (van Harmelen et al., 2020). Going to school enables them to easily meet their friends.</p>



<p>However, we feel policy makers could inform citizens more on practical coping strategies for families to foster mental well-being. We know for instance that staying active and exercising can boost your mood, but without a regular commute to work and regular sports activities, it is good to provide some alternative strategies which fit all different levels of lockdown.</p>



<p><strong><em>Several potential factors that could be further studied are mentioned in the article, but do you think applying your methodology to other populations of people or during a different 2-week stretch of the pandemic would provide useful data?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, we believe that applying the methodology of EMA to other populations could provide us with useful information on which groups of people are struggling in the current situation. For instance, gaining insights in how parents or adolescents with psychological problems, such as anxiety or depression, are affected by the pandemic. </p>



<p>The timing of our study is also of importance. We have collected data during the first part of the lockdown in the Netherlands, without any prospect of relaxation of the regulations. If we would study mental well-being now, during the current—less strict but still prolonging—lockdown, we might get different results.</p>



<p><strong><em>If the general public were to take one lesson from your study, what should that be?</em></strong></p>



<p>As we will still spend a lot of time at home, conflicts and irritations among household members could make it hard to keep the atmosphere at home comfortable, a piece of practical advice to families is to cherish small positive interactions with each other on a regular basis. For instance, ask each other which person you admire and why, or go for a short walk together. Even those small activities or conversations could improve the overall family atmosphere. Above all, we need to keep in mind that all families are different, so within the possibilities, find what suits your family best to remain sane together.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you sit down to watch TV or a film these holidays, you might want to pay a little extra attention to how the soundtrack makes you feel. We all know that background music influences the tone of a scene but what, exactly, soundtracks do to our understanding of a character has not been studied in detail. In a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02242/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_1456740_69_Psycho_20201013_arts_A%5C">new paper</a>, in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>, Alessandro Ansani at Roma Tre University, Italy, and colleagues report work aimed at filling in some of the gaps.</p>



<span id="more-41061"></span>



<p>The team recruited 118 online participants who each watched a video clip that was just under two minutes long. It showed a man slowly walking towards tall windows in the columned corridor of an old building. The seaside was visible through the windows, in the distance. As the researchers describe it, he “walks, looks outside, stops, and moves out of the frame.” </p>



<p>At the same time, some of the participants heard the ambient sound that was recorded during the filming, while some heard an extract of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&amp;ab_channel=Variatio24">The Isle of the Dead</a>” by Sergei Rachmaninov (a “dogged and anxious” orchestral piece), and the rest heard “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoapxPvZy4&amp;ab_channel=DrMabuse05">Like Someone in Love</a>” by Bill Evans (a “soft, melancholic” piano jazz solo). The participants then filled in questionnaires that asked about their perceptions of the man’s emotions, thoughts and personality, and how pleasant they thought the environment was .</p>



<p>Compared with the other groups, those who’d heard the jazz reported feeling more empathy for the man, and perceived him to be more introverted. The Rachmaninov group felt him to be more conscientious, however. Participants who heard either music soundtrack perceived him to be more agreeable than those who only heard ambient sounds. Those who’d heard the jazz were also more likely to feel that the man was remembering a pleasant event in the past compared with the Rachmaninov listeners, who were more inclined to think that he was planning something. The jazz group also perceived his environment to be cosier. A second study with a batch of 92 students largely replicated these findings.</p>



<p>These findings highlight “the multifaceted influence of the soundtrack on the interpretation of a scene,” the researchers write. We humans have an incessant need to search for knowledge everywhere, they add, and to fill in gaps using inference and imagination. “To understand the plot of a novel or movie, we need to know the characters’ goals and personalities, and if we have no information whatsoever, we try to take advantage of any cue to guess them.” Music, it seems, can act as a complex cue, allowing us to build up a picture of a person and a scene.</p>



<p>Though the original group watched the film out of the lab, the results may not extend to typical viewers of movies. While the participants did consistently report particular impressions of the man’s personality and thoughts when asked to do so, that doesn’t necessarily mean that people spontaneously form such impressions unprompted while watching a blockbuster on their sofa. However, though we would all probably expect movie soundtracks to have an impact on us, this research does help to address a previous criticism that actual research in this field has been sparse.</p>

<p><strong>Neurobiology of Pain and Endogenous Opioids</strong></p>
<p>BRAIN aims to understand how neural circuit activity translates to sensory, emotional, and cognitive functions, all of which are closely related to or controlled by pain circuits and/ or endogenous opioid systems. Pain conditions and the opioid crisis are important national public health concerns. As such, the BRAIN Initiative is now funding projects to elucidate the basic neurobiology and circuits of pain processing, analgesia, and the brain mechanisms implicated in opioid use.</p>
<p>Please see notices <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-18-008.html">NOT-NS-18-008</a> (pain) and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-18-046.html">NOT-DA-10-046</a> (opioids) for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Data Science and Standardization</strong></p>
<p>The BRAIN Initiative and neuroscience as a whole are generating massive amounts of data that span modalities, spatiotemporal scales, and species. Largely driven by recent innovations in high-throughput -omics profiling, optical microscopy, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging, brain data is rapidly growing. The FOAs below support new approaches to analyze, archive, and standardize the collection of these data. For all awards collaborations with scientists from other disciplines are encouraged. </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The “tragedy of the commons” was popularised in the 1960s as a way of explaining how public or shared resources which we’re incentivised to use can become depleted or ruined by individual self-interest. And because we have <em>shared</em> ownership of public resources we feel we have less responsibility for them and therefore less of an impetus to contribute time, energy or money to keeping them going.</p>



<p>As we become more aware (and more concerned) about threats to the environment, the tragedy of the commons seems even more pertinent. How do we keep parks, rivers, lakes and other local resources well-maintained? According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242920952084">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Marketing, </em>it might come down to a sense of ownership — the more we feel a property or resource is ours, the better we’ll take care of it.</p>



<span id="more-41056"></span>



<p>The focus of the first study was a lake, where 135 participants had rented kayaks. The rental service largely catered to those with no experience of the lake, meaning they were unlikely to have any sense of ownership of the area before their visit. Some of the kayak renters were asked to think of and write down a nickname for the lake, while others were not; all renters were then told that they should pick up objects or trash they found floating in the lake.</p>



<p>Two experimenters then watched the participants and recorded any attempts to pick up floating objects (which had been planted in the lake by the team). When the participants returned their kayaks, they indicated whether or not they had picked up any rubbish and how much ownership they felt toward the lake.</p>



<p>Those who had given the lake a nickname reported significantly higher levels of psychological ownership of the lake than those who had not. They were also more likely to actually take care of the lake: 41% attempted to pick up the floating objects, compared to just 7% of those in the control condition.</p>



<p>In the second study, participants imagined walking in a park, seeing a sign that said either “welcome to the park” or “welcome to <em>your</em> park” (emphasis added). Participants were then asked how much responsibility they felt for the park, how obligated they felt towards the park, how accountable they felt for it, and whether or not they would pick up rubbish in the park. Participants were also asked how much of $100 they would donate to the park.</p>



<p>Again, boosting feelings of ownership by highlighting that it was “your” park increased participants’ perceived responsibility for the park. This led these participants to say they would be more likely to pick up rubbish, and to increase their intended donation amount by an average of $8. </p>



<p>The third study, back in the real world, looked at cross country skiers. When renting skis, participants were offered a map of the park: some were asked to plan their route on the map before they set out, while others were not. All renters were then asked whether or not they wanted to add a dollar to the rental fee to help the park, before indicating how likely they would be to volunteer for the park, donate in the future, or engage with the park on social media. Participants who planned their route again reported greater responsibility for the park, and were also more likely to say they’d donate to the park and volunteer in future.</p>



<p>A final study, lab-based study found that a commonly used device — an attendance sign which highlighted that a participant was the 22,452th visitor of the week — reduced the beneficial effects of boosting feelings of psychological ownership. This suggests that when people see themselves as just one individual in a larger group, they felt less responsibility towards the environment.</p>



<p>While the results do suggest clear interventions that could benefit publicly owned goods, the whole point of such resources is that they’re <em>shared</em> — the fact they’re collectively owned is exactly why we’re able to enjoy their many benefits. So should we be encouraging people to think of them as their <em>individual</em> property? Collectivism puts an emphasis on group collaboration and shared interests — factors that could play a part in preserving local resources. </p>



<p>Further research could look into interventions that seek to increase feelings of local collectivity, exploring how that, rather than individualism, might change people’s relationship with their surroundings.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shreyah Iyer will talk about her project "Speech Emotion recognition using deep neural networks using Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Speech is a very important context in understanding human emotions for example
in psychology and criminology as the effects of emotions in voice can be
recognized by all people irrespective of the language of speech. In this
presentation I will talk about an ongoing KTP Project on Speech Emotion
Recognition system.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to build a system which can interpret the underlying
emotion from an audio/speech signal. So far, I have worked on using Deep
Learning architectures, i.e CNN’s with most widely used features for emotion
detection such as MFCC’s and Mel-spectrograms. I have especially investigated
what the best way is to use the coefficients extracted from MFCC’s. I have
worked on are two publicly available Speech Emotion Corpus i.e., TESS and
RAVDESS. Results conducted on these experiments show that the MFCC’s features
with an optimal stack length supersedes the other CNN architectures used.</p>
<p>In this presentation I will also talk about the challenges and future work for
this project.</p>
