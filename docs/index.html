<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.</p>
<p>Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-12411" height="553" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/shutterstock_600015697844.jpg" width="700" /></blockquote>
<p><strong>What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?</strong><br />
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.</p>
<p>Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.</p>
<p>In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>How can publishers advance public engagement?</strong><br />
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable <strong>“Patients perspectives”</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors <strong>to write a lay summary</strong> of their work (in one or more languages), <strong>a patient information note</strong>, and/or <strong>depict an infographic</strong> to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.</p>
<p>Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating <strong>the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist</strong>. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.</p>

<p><strong>The new normal</strong><br />
Innovations like creating and training<strong> a pool of engaged patient reviewers</strong> to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the <a href="https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/">Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/">Arthritis Foundation</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> the results of <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3">a systematic review</a> and <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0">a global survey</a> analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/">Brian Simulator</a> is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephants-trunk-suction-biophysics-water-airflow">Newly recognized tricks help elephants suck up huge amounts of water</a></h4>

<p>Whether or not it’s possible to teach an old elephant new tricks, a 34-year-old pachyderm at Zoo Atlanta has recently taught researchers a thing or two about how elephants suck up food and water with their trunks.</p>



<p>For one thing, an elephant doesn’t use its trunk as a simple straw. It can also <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0215">dilate its nostrils to boost its trunk’s carrying capacity</a> while snorting up water, researchers report online June 2 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. And that means it takes fewer snorts than expected to stock up on water that they use to drink and hose themselves down.</p>



<p>The surprise finding came courtesy of detailed measurements during feeding time, says Andrew Schulz, a mechanical engineer at the Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Other than aquatic creatures, not many animals other than elephants use a type of suction feeding that doesn’t depend on lung power alone.</p>



<p>Elephants are the only living land animals to evolve a long, boneless appendage like a trunk, says Schulz. A septum stretching the length of the trunk separates it into two nostrils. But detailed knowledge of what happens inside that muscular structure during feeding has been sorely lacking. So Schulz and his colleagues worked with zookeepers at Zoo Atlanta to take a peek.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>An elephant’s trunk is iconic. But understanding what happens inside that muscular structure during feeding has been sorely lacking. Experiments with a patient pachyderm at Zoo Atlanta reveal its tricks for inhaling everything from small cubes of rutabaga to massive volumes of water.</figure>



<p>Using ultrasound to monitor what was happening inside the trunk during feeding, the researchers put one of the zoo’s African elephants through her paces during the summer of 2018. In some trials, the elephant snorted up volumes of water, which in some cases had bran mixed in.</p>



<p>To the researchers’ surprise, says Schulz, the ultrasound revealed that each nostril’s available volume ballooned by as much as 64 percent, up from the trunk’s original capacity of about five liters (although the elephant used only a small fraction of this extra space). Flow rate of water through the trunk averaged about 3.7 liters per second, or the equivalent of the amount of water pouring out of 24 shower heads at once.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="three-panel photo shows the tip of an elephant's trunk sniffing up chia seeds at 0 secons, 0.67 seconds and 1.33 seconds" class="wp-image-3100140" height="324" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060221_SP_elephant-suction_inline_680.png" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100140">A layer of chia seeds along the bottom of a container of water helped researchers study just how fast an African elephant sucks water up into her trunk.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100140">A.K. Schulz <em>et al/J. Roy. Soc. Interface</em> 2021</span></figure>



<p>In other trials, the elephant was offered small cubes of rutabaga of various sizes. When offered just a few cubes, the elephant picked them up with the prehensile tip of the trunk. But when offered piles of cubes, she switched into vacuum mode. Here, the nostrils don’t expand, but rather the elephant breathes in deeply to hoover up the food.</p>



<p>Based on the amount and rate of water snuffed up by the elephant, the researchers estimated that airflow through the narrow nostrils could at times exceed 150 meters per second — more than 30 times as fast as a human sneeze, Schulz says.</p>





<p> The internal structure of an elephant’s trunk — except for the nostrils — is similar to an octopus’s tentacle or a mammalian tongue, says William Kier, a biomechanicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with this study. The trunk’s intricate musculature and lack of joints “create a great diversity, complexity and precision of movement,” he says.</p>



<p>“How <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/hungry-elephants-turn-trunks-leaf-blowers">elephants use their trunks</a> is pretty fascinating,” says John Hutchinson, a biomechanicist at the Royal Veterinary College in Hertfordshire, England, also not involved with this study (<em>SN: 11/16/15</em>). And although engineers have already designed robotic devices based on an elephant’s trunk, the team’s new findings may yield even wilder designs, he says. “You never know where bioinspiration will lead.”</p>

When the University of Colorado at Denver completed an investigation in 2015 into the work of a former faculty member, the school recommended that nine papers be corrected or retracted. But six years after the close of that investigation, the researcher, urologist Hari Koul, has had just two papers retracted and one corrected.  Multiple journal … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/03/exclusive-six-years-after-a-misconduct-investigation-more-than-half-of-suspect-papers-remain-unflagged/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Exclusive: Six years after a misconduct investigation, more than half of suspect papers remain unflagged</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/06/03/e-cigarettes-and-smoking-among-teenagers/">E-cigarettes and smoking among teenagers</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published <em>Tobacco Free Ireland</em>, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1">Our systematic review</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.</p>
<blockquote><p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes</p></blockquote>
<p>Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.</p>

<br /><p>Join us for a <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org">OCNS</a>) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021">here</a>.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.</p>
<p>The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.</p>
<p>To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>While some vegetarians yearn for meat (and occasionally give into temptation), others who eschew animal products find meat repulsive. Those who go veggie for moral reasons — as opposed to those who do it for their health — are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00685.x">particularly likely</a> to find meat disgusting, even if they previously enjoyed its taste.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!">new study</a> from a University of Exeter team, it isn’t just vegetarians who find the look of meat disgusting, either — sometimes, meat-eaters do too. And in a world where many of us are being encouraged to give up meat for the sake of the environment, the researchers suggest that harnessing this disgust could be a way of reducing intake when other techniques fail.</p>



<span id="more-42446"></span>



<p>The 711 participants in the study were a mix of people with different diets — 56% identified as omnivores, 28% as flexitarians (i.e. those who are sometimes vegetarian and sometimes omnivorous), and 15% vegetarians, some of whom were vegan and some pescatarian.</p>



<p>First, an implicit association task (IAT) measured implicit attitudes towards meat. Participants were presented with a series of images of foods, which they had to classify as meat or carbs, and words like “foul” or “mouth-watering”, which they had to classify as “delicious” or “disgusting”. The participants sorted both images and words into categories using left and right keys on their keyboard: for example, on one side they might see “carbs OR disgusting” and on the other “meat OR delicious” (in other trials, “meat” was paired with “disgusting” instead). If you find meat delicious, then responding should be faster when “meat” and “delicious” share the same key, the logic goes (though the IAT itself has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">faced controversy</a>).    </p>



<p>Next, the team looked at <em>explicit</em> responses to meat. The same pictures of meat and carbs were used, with participants asked to rate the images on a scale from 0 to 100 according to taste, how likely they would be to eat the food, and feelings of disgust. Finally, the team measured self-control, how much meat participants ate, and how long they had followed their particular diet. A follow-up survey, six months later, repeated these measures.</p>



<p>Vegetarians exhibited the highest level of disgust in both the explicit and implicit tests, with flexitarians second highest above omnivores. Carbs, on the other hand, were liked equally across all groups.</p>



<p>Vegetarians don’t like meat: it’s hardly breaking news. But what <em>was</em> interesting about the results was the relationship between meat disgust and intake in the other two groups. In both the omnivore and flexitarian sample those who felt higher explicit meat disgust also had lower meat intake.</p>



<p>The follow-up study provided further evidence that disgust has a tangible impact on how people eat. Flexitarians who showed an increase in their levels of explicit disgust of meat over the six month period had also decreased their meat intake by the time of the second survey.</p>



<p>Encouraging disgust of meat could, therefore, be a way of encouraging people to cut down on meat. The team points to previous <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.766">research</a> that suggests many omnivores simply repress feelings of disgust around eating sentient, emotional creatures: harnessing this knowledge and increasing disgust could be one way of persuading someone that life is better vegetarian. However, it may not be a foolproof strategy — at present, it’s not clear in which direction the effect is working. Is disgust causing people to cut down on meat, or is cutting down on meat increasing disgust? Further research could look more closely at the direction of cause-and-effect.</p>

<p>Last March, I shared <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/">my concerns</a> about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996">a paper </a>from the <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/">IHU-Méditerranée Infection</a> (IHUMI)/ <a href="https://www.univ-amu.fr/en">Aix-Marseille University</a> (AMU) that claimed that Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin could reduce coronavirus viral loads faster than no treatment. </p>



<p>Other papers by this group of researchers, led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand Professor Eric Chabrière, appear to contain problems as well, ranging from potential duplicated images to ethical concerns. </p>



<p>In this blog post I have compiled the papers by the Raoult and Chabriere that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a combination of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors to take away any concerns by providing the original figures.</p>

<h3>Concerns about duplicated images</h3>



<p>A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors did not reply to most of these PubPeer posts or corrected the errors.</p>



<h3>Category I duplications</h3>



<p>Some papers, such as DOI: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/">10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED">PubPeer</a>] or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/">10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A"> </a>[<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A">PubPeer</a>] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/">a previous post</a>, I call these <strong>Category I duplications</strong>, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. Often, these simple duplications are honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum. Unfortunately, the authors did not reply to most of the PubPeer posts.</p>

<h3>Category II duplications</h3>



<p>Two papers in this set contain <strong>Category II duplications</strong>, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. </p>



<p>DOI <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/">10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436</a> [<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1">PubPeer</a>] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which is unexpected if these were unintentional errors. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction.

<p>As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> docs or you browse <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill</a>, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.</p>

Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex">pycortex library</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?</p>



<p>A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Technology</th><th>Application areas</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th><th>What you learn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Python-based generators</td><td>Dashboards, lightweight interactions</td><td>Easy distribution, low barrier to entry</td><td>Limited interactivity</td><td>Grammar of interactive graphics</td></tr><tr><td>Jupyter notebook</td><td>Daily data exploration</td><td>You’re already using it!</td><td>Distribution not straightforward</td><td>Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG</td></tr><tr><td>Walled garden</td><td>All-in-one visualizations (widgets)</td><td>Limited things to learn</td><td>What you learn is non-transferable</td><td>The walled garden</td></tr><tr><td>JS notebooks</td><td>Literate programs</td><td>REPL environment, good docs</td><td>Learning curve a bit steep</td><td>Core JS plus visualization libraries</td></tr><tr><td>The web</td><td>Web dataviz</td><td>You control everything</td><td>Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep</td><td>Packaging, components, deployment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2>Step 0: Python-based generators</h2>



<p>Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging Python-based generators. Some tools offer limited interactivity while staying entirely in Python. These tools have <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617">seen explosive growth in the past few years</a>. Overall, these solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations.</p>

<p><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> serves plots and dashboards from Python. A script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, and the whole thing is served in the cloud. The streamlit server does its own caching to minimize requests. Every request has some lag but the solution has surprisingly good performance. Some custom visualizations can be written in JS via a component API. Cons: does lightweight interactivity well – sliders, combo boxes – but not meant for anything too interactive. Limited by the set of components offered by default. <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery">Sample visualizations here</a>.</p>



<h3>Dash</h3>



<p>Similar to Streamlit, but <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">focused on the plotly ecosystem</a>. Dash is targeted more towards at enterprise users. <a href="https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/">Sample visualizations here</a>.</p>



<h3>Plotting and mapping libraries</h3>



<p>Some Python plotting and mapping libraries offer minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc.. This includes <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>, <a href="http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html">Bokeh w/Holoviews</a> and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html">Altair w/vegalite</a>. On the mapping side, <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet">ipyleaflet</a> is worth mentioning. </p>



<h2>Step 1: build for jupyter notebook</h2>



<p>Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser <em>right now</em>, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.</p>



<h3>_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="Image" height="126" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="417" />Basic demo of _repr_html_</figure></div>



<p>When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a <code>_repr_html_</code> method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing">See this colab for examples on how to do this</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669">You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method</a>, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. </p>



<p>You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output">using the ipython API</a>. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;'))
</pre></div>


<h3>ipywidgets and interact</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>ipywidgets</strong>, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb">interactive HTML widgets</a> for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.</p><cite><a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">The ipywidget manual</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Next in line in complexity are <code>ipywidgets</code>. Like <code>IPython.core.display</code>, <code>ipywidgets</code> can display rich HTML; however, <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html">widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python</a>. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5">See this notebook for an example</a>. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called <code>interact</code> which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.</p>



<h3>voila</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif" /><a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">Voila example, from their docs</a>.</figure>



<p>Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called <a href="https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila">voila</a>. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Walled gardens</h2>



<p>At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing <em>real javascript</em> in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.</p>



<h3>Unity</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-width="550"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A little Plinko sim<img alt="🎄" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f384.png" style="height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#unity3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/geKwfhlpj6">pic.twitter.com/geKwfhlpj6</a></p>— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1209900584473632770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">difficult to interact with the native DOM</a>. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.</p>



<h3>p5.js and openprocessing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><br /><br />OpenProcessing sketch, <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689">Self-organized critical model</a></figure>



<p><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://openprocessing.org/">openprocessing</a> bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Javascript notebooks</h2>



<p>The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. </p>



<p>For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.</p>



<h3>Observable</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7664" data-attachment-id="7664" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png" data-orig-size="603,602" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/" height="572" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603" width="573" /></a>Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example">Code here</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  <a href="https://observablehq.com/tutorials">It has an excellent set of starter tutorials</a>. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript">it does not use Javascript</a>, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.</p>



<h3>Starboard</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7671" data-attachment-id="7671" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coupled-oscillators" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif" data-orig-size="380,380" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380" /></a>An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. <a href="https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a">Source</a>.</figure></div>



<p><a href="https://starboard.gg/">Starboard</a> is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” </p><cite>Pyodide docs</cite></blockquote>



<p>You’ll still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Nevertheless, but you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like <a href="https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite">jupyterlite</a> are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.</p>



<h2>Step 4: the web</h2>



<p>Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>, might satisfy your needs. </p>



<p>For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">flask</a> deployed on <a href="https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku">heroku</a> would do the trick.</p>



<h2>JS libraries</h2>



<p>As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:</p>



<ul><li>d3: data driven documents in JS, <a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a></li><li>mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: <a href="https://mathjs.org/">https://mathjs.org/</a></li><li>stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib</a></li><li>Vega lite: declarative plots in js <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/</a></li><li>Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">https://www.tensorflow.org/js</a></li><li>Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: <a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a></li></ul>



<p>I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">NASA will be heading back to Venus for the first time in decades</a></h4>

<p>Earth’s evil twin, here we come. NASA’s next two missions, named DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, are heading to Venus, administrator Bill Nelson announced at a news conference June 2.</p>



<p>“These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world capable of melting lead at the surface,” Nelson said. “We hope these missions will further our understanding of how Earth evolved and why it’s currently habitable, when others in our solar system are not.”</p>



<p>The missions were selected from four finalists, two headed to Venus, one to Jupiter’s volcanic moon Io, and one to Neptune’s largest moon Triton. The two Venus missions had applied and been rejected in earlier spacecraft selection rounds.</p>



<p>Venus is almost the same size as Earth, but it seems to have had a different history. Although there’s evidence that it was once covered in oceans and could have been habitable, today it’s a scorched hellscape with clouds of sulfuric acid. No <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">spacecraft has lasted</a> more than two hours on its surface (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>). And no NASA mission has visited in more than 30 years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="NASA DAVINCI+ probe illustrated" class="wp-image-3100155" height="1067" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060221_lg_venus-missions_inline1_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100155">The DAVINCI+ mission includes a probe (illustrated here) that will drop through the Venusian atmosphere, tasting and measuring as it goes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100155">GSFC/NASA</span></figure></div>



<p>One of the newly selected missions, DAVINCI+, will be the first to send a probe into the planet’s thick, hot atmosphere. The spacecraft will be a ball about a meter in diameter that will sink through Venus’ atmosphere over the course of about an hour, taking measurements of how the content of the planet’s atmosphere changes from top to bottom. The probe will also take some of the highest-resolution photos of the Venusian surface yet on its way down.</p>



<p>Those observations will help scientists figure out how Venus’ water has changed over time, its volcanic activity now and in the past, and the planet’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-once-possibly-habitable-study-suggests"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-once-possibly-habitable-study-suggests">past potential for habitability</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/16</em>). The data will also help scientists<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">interpret observations of Earth-sized exoplanets with atmospheres</a> that could be taken with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, giving researchers a way to tell exo-Earths from exo-Venuses (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>).</p>





<p>The other mission, VERITAS, will orbit Venus and study the planet’s surface to figure out its history and why it’s so different from Earth. The orbiter will map the surface with radar, chart elevations to make 3-D maps and look for plate tectonics and volcanism still ongoing on Venus. These observations could provide data for a<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-europa-landing-terrain-future-spacecraft"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-europa-landing-terrain-future-spacecraft">future mission to land </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-europa-landing-terrain-future-spacecraft">on Venus</a> (<em>SN: 12/23/20</em>).</p>



<p>The missions are <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-2-missions-to-study-lost-habitable-world-of-venus">expected to launch</a> sometime between 2028 and 2030, NASA said in a statement.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-vaccines-coronavirus-covid-serrana-normal">After vaccinating 95 percent of adults, a Brazilian city is returning to normal</a></h4>

<p>In Serrana, Brazil, schools are reopening and plans are under way for a large open-air concert. Health care workers suddenly have time for sit-down meals rather than rushing to grab street food during a spare free moment. These scenes approaching normalcy stand in stark contrast to what’s happening across the rest of the country, where hospitals are jam-packed, businesses are largely closed and 2,000 people are dying each day from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Serrana, a city of 45,600 in the state of São Paulo, can begin to make these plans because an experiment called Projeto S, which vaccinated nearly all adults, appears to be drastically reducing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths there.</p>



<p>Symptomatic cases have dropped 80 percent, with hospital admissions down 86 percent, down from a peak of around 600 cases per 100,000 people in early March, Projeto S leaders announced at a news conference on May 31. By two weeks after the second shot, only two fully vaccinated people landed in the hospital with COVID-19.</p>



<p>The incidence of COVID-19–related deaths per 100,000 inhabitants also dropped 95 percent in the city, the team leaders said, although the raw data behind the numbers has yet to be released. In April, the city recorded only six COVID-19 deaths, according to the Health Secretariat of Serrana. </p>





<p>The project, in which over 95 percent of the city’s adults were given the Chinese-made CoronaVac vaccine, is a real-time experiment to measure the<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-serrana-brazil-covid-mass-vaccine"> effectiveness the vaccine</a>, including how well it protects against coronavirus variants (<em>SN 5/5/21</em>). In clinical trials, the CoronaVac vaccine had an efficacy of just over 50 percent, raising concerns of how well it would work in the real world.</p>



<p>“This project is important because it shows that even a vaccine with relatively low efficacy can have high efficiency and significantly decrease death rates in real-life settings,” says neuroscientist Mellanie Fontes-Dutra, coordinator of the COVID-19 Analysis Network in Brazil, who is not involved in the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-serrana-brazil-covid-mass-vaccine">The results also show the vaccine is </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-p1-variant-brazil-strain-transmission-immunity">effective against a more contagious version of the virus</a> called P.1, which was dominant in Serrana by the time the study started, Ricardo Palácios, director for clinical trials at Instituto Butantan and director of Projeto S, said (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>The numbers are still preliminary, and researchers will have to look at the raw data of the experiment to ensure the vaccine works on a large scale, Fontes-Dutra says. “But these preliminary numbers show we have an effective vaccine. And the most important thing to do is expand vaccination coverage as much as we can to have as many immunized people as possible.” </p>



<p>As more people are vaccinated, they form a kind of immunological shield that protects individuals for whom the vaccine might not work so well or those who are still susceptible to infection, such as immunosuppressed HIV patients, Fontes-Dutra says.</p>



<p>The city is beginning to test the strength of that shield as residents return to church, families throw parties for their children and schools reopen. Cases have also dropped among those under 18, who are not yet vaccinated, suggesting the campaign is having a spillover protective effect, the researchers say.</p>



<p>On May 30, São Paulo governor João Doria announced on Fantástico, an evening TV show in Brazil, that there are even plans in the works for a “big open-air public event in Serrana, such as a music concert.” Along with offering some semblance of normalcy, the concert could be used to test the vaccine and its ability to protect people in large crowds, Doria said.</p>



<p>The event will provide important information to the Projeto S team, which will keep observing Serrana for a year to measure vaccine protection and how long it lasts. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bcg-tb-vaccine-diseases-diabetes-multiple-sclerosis">A repurposed TB vaccine shows early promise against diseases like diabetes and MS</a></h4>

<p>Around the world, volunteers are getting a vaccine developed to prevent tuberculosis in studies that have nothing to do with TB. Called Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or BCG, the shot is being tested as a treatment for type 1 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and even COVID-19.</p>



<p>BCG is a live but weakened version of <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>, a relative of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, the bacterium that causes the infectious lung disease known as TB. The vaccine has been around for 100 years and is routinely given to children in nearly all non-Western nations.</p>



<p>Almost as soon as BCG was introduced in the 1920s, researchers noticed a drop in infant deaths in some places where the vaccine was used. Later studies revealed that the vaccine protects against a range of infections. Much more recently, a single dose of the vaccine <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31139-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420311399%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">reduced the risk of respiratory infections</a> in elderly study participants compared with those who got a placebo, according to an October 15 report in <em>Cell</em>.</p>



<p>The vaccine appears to boost immunity in some situations, but paradoxically, BCG may also calm an overactive immune system. It’s this soothing effect that made researchers take a look at BCG for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including eczema, asthma, allergies and multiple sclerosis. In MS, a disease in which the immune system attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, BCG appears to slow damage to the brain.</p>





<p>“Everybody kept getting signals, often from human data, saying this microorganism is doing beneficial things … whether it was allergy or autoimmunity or multiple sclerosis or diabetes,” says immunologist Denise Faustman of Harvard Medical School. “Over the last 10 years, that dataset has just grown and grown.” Faustman is testing BCG as a therapy for people with type 1 diabetes. In this autoimmune disease, the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leaving the body unable to make the insulin needed to control blood sugar levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Everybody kept getting signals, often from human data, saying this microorganism is doing beneficial things … whether it was allergy or autoimmunity or multiple sclerosis or diabetes.” </p><cite>Immunologist Denise Faustman, Harvard Medical School</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Faustman is in the midst of a 150-person safety and efficacy trial of BCG in adults with type 1 diabetes. Her team previously showed, in a small study published in 2018, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-018-0062-8">the vaccine can safely improve blood glucose control</a> in patients with long-term disease who continued taking insulin. The vaccine appears to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220302704">reprogram immune cells</a> to take up extra glucose, her team reported in <em>iScience</em> in May 2020.</p>



<p>Now, she and other researchers are digging into the basic science behind their observations, while also launching clinical trials of BCG in patients with type 1 diabetes, MS and Alzheimer’s. The scientists hope the answers will help drum up support for this line of research, which has drawn skepticism in the scientific community.</p>



<h3>An unlikely treatment</h3>



<p>Evidence of BCG’s unanticipated effects has been quietly accumulating for decades. In some settings the vaccine reduced the overall rate of infant death by about 30 percent, based on a 2016 systematic review in <em>BMJ</em> of both clinical trials and observational studies. In the 1980s, the vaccine became a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833102/">standard immune-boosting treatment for people with bladder cancer</a>. In a study reported in 2019 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>, people who got BCG in childhood <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2751896">had a 2.5-fold lower risk for lung cancer</a> as adults.</p>



<p>But none of this was on Faustman’s radar when her type 1 diabetes research led her to BCG. Her goal was to stop the autoimmune attack on beta cells, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Normally, beta cells respond to changes in blood glucose and release just enough insulin to trigger other cells to take up glucose from the blood and burn it up for energy.</p>



<p>In type 1 diabetes, immune system T cells destroy beta cells, so people with the disease must frequently monitor their blood glucose and inject insulin to keep glucose levels within a healthy range. Very high or very low glucose levels can cause coma or death. Over a lifetime, less extreme glucose fluctuations lead to blood vessel damage along with kidney, heart and vision problems.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h4>The long view</h4>



<p>Over time, poor glucose control in people with diabetes can lead to:</p>



<ul><li>Vision problems</li><li>Kidney disease</li><li>Nerve damage with pain, burning or loss of feeling</li><li>Heart attack and stroke due to blood vessel damage</li><li>Foot infections, amputation</li><li>Depression</li></ul>
</div>



<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Faustman’s team and others found that a molecule called TNF alpha, which is made by some immune cells, could selectively kill the T cells that attack beta cells. Among its many jobs, TNF alpha fights bacterial infections and helps the body make T regulatory cells, or T-regs, which act as referees to prevent collateral damage during immune responses. For reasons that are not well understood, in people with type 1 diabetes, T-regs are either too few or defective. Faustman and others found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4735064/">TNF alpha boosted T-reg numbers and activity</a> in mice and in human cells.</p>



<p>But giving TNF alpha directly wasn’t an option; it was expensive and hard to administer safely. So Faustman’s team searched for something that could trigger immune cells to make TNF alpha on their own. “The answer that kept popping up was BCG,” Faustman says.</p>



<p>Another research group led by immunologist Bhagirath Singh, then at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, had found in the 1990s that BCG and a related immune stimulant called complete Freund’s adjuvant, or CFA, could <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9218754/">prevent type 1 diabetes in mice prone to the disease</a>. CFA, which is made with dead <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, also protected pancreatic cell transplants in diabetic mice from destruction by the immune system.</p>



<p>Faustman’s team found similar results, as well as that diabetic mice given CFA began producing their own insulin; their pancreases seemed to be healing. The finding was intriguing, but in type 1 diabetes research, Faustman cautions, “everything works in the mouse.”</p>



<p>In 1994, an Israeli team used BCG and got blood sugar under control, with very little insulin use, in children recently diagnosed with the disease. The results, however, could not be replicated.</p>



<p>That didn’t deter Faustman. There are at least a dozen strains of the BCG organism used for vaccines, and scientists have learned that different strains have different effects on the immune system. Faustman’s team screened several strains to find one that could trigger TNF alpha and shift the balance between autoimmune T cells and T-regs in samples of white blood cells from people with type 1 diabetes.</p>



<p>With a strain in hand that worked, Faustman’s team recruited three adults who had been living for many years with type 1 diabetes, and had never been vaccinated with BCG. Each person got two injections of BCG, four weeks apart. The volunteers continued using insulin while their blood was checked for changes to T cells and levels of hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, which tells how well-controlled glucose is in the blood.</p>



<p>During the 20-week study, the researchers saw small changes to T cells, but no big improvement in HbA1c, the measurement that really matters to type 1 diabetes patients.</p>



<h3>Wait for it</h3>



<p>By this time, Faustman had met researchers from Rome who had found that BCG could reduce the likelihood that people with brain inflammation would develop multiple sclerosis — but the effect was most apparent after months to years. With this longer time frame in mind, Faustman checked in with the patients from her study annually to measure HbA1c levels. After year three, “the HbA1c’s were down 10 to 18 percent,” Faustman says. “It was not subtle.”</p>



<p>To put that into context, for every 10 percent drop in HbA1c, the risks of diseases caused by blood vessel damage — a major problem in people with diabetes — drop 25 to 44 percent. Faustman’s team added six more patients to the study, and all nine volunteers went at least three years with near-normal blood sugar levels. Three of those patients <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-018-0062-8">maintained these levels for five years</a>, the team reported in <em>npj Vaccines</em> in 2018. And none of the patients reported episodes of blood sugar dropping too low.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Sugar drop </h4>



<p>In a small study, nine patients with type 1 diabetes (red line) got two shots of BCG. Three years later, that group experienced drops in blood glucose, as measured by hemoglobin A1c. HbA1c levels remained low for several years compared with patients who were untreated (dashed line) or given a placebo (black line). Throughout the experiment, all of the patients continued taking insulin.</p>

<p>The HbA1c shift was exciting, but Faustman was perplexed when she looked for its cause. The patients’ T-regs were more active, as expected, but levels of natural insulin did not go up, suggesting something else was helping to control blood sugar.</p>



<p>A clue came from the breakdown products, or metabolites, in the patients’ blood made when cells use glucose. Those metabolites were more abundant in the blood after patients received BCG. Faustman’s group also found that before BCG treatment, patients had lower levels of the metabolites than healthy people, which the researchers confirmed by studying blood from another 100 patients with type 1 diabetes.</p>



<p>Looking more closely, the team found that white blood cells — specifically monocytes — from people with type 1 diabetes took up less glucose than did the same cells in healthy people. But exposing patients’ monocytes to BCG in the lab <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220302704">corrected this defect in glucose metabolism</a>, the researchers reported last year in<em> iScience</em>.</p>



<p>In the same study, the researchers gave a new group of patients three BCG injections in a year and observed that genes related to breaking down glucose were more active in the patients’ T cells and monocytes than before the shots.</p>



<p>“BCG was taking these underlying defects in diabetics, both in the immune system and metabolism, and correcting them towards normal,” Faustman says. BCG seems to give the patients a new way to dispose of glucose, she says.</p>



<h3>Hope or hype?</h3>



<p>Faustman’s work has generated a wide range of reactions from people within the type 1 diabetes community. Patients are excited by the possibility of an inexpensive treatment that, while not a cure, could make life easier. With type 1 diabetes on the rise, currently affecting 1.6 million people in the United States, and with the high cost of insulin, anything that could help patients regulate blood sugar without increasing insulin doses could have a big impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Even if it’s in addition to current insulin therapy, it’s a great hope.”</p><cite>Pediatric endocrinologist Siham D. Accacha, NYU Long Island School of Medicine</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Even if it’s in addition to current insulin therapy, it’s a great hope,” says Siham D. Accacha, a pediatric endocrinologist at NYU Long Island School of Medicine in Mineola, N.Y. Managing glucose levels takes a physical, mental and emotional toll on patients and their families, she says. Wearable glucose monitors and automatic insulin pumps help, but “we don’t have a treatment that could help improve blood sugar from inside,” she says. If BCG has a chance of doing that, she says, “I think it’s worth a try.”</p>



<p>Accacha adds that BCG has a long safety record; its risks are minuscule compared with other treatments for type 1 diabetes, such as drugs that suppress the immune system, which increases infection risk, or pancreas transplants, which also require immune suppression.</p>



<p>Faustman says patients are also encouraged by the findings because the research included people who have been living with diabetes for a long time, an average of 19 years. Most, if not all, other studies recruit only newly diagnosed people, says David Leslie, an endocrinologist at the University of London. “Anything that could work in established type 1 diabetes is a big deal,” he says.</p>

<h4>Multiaction</h4>



<p>BCG appears to affect the immune system in paradoxical ways. It improves trained immunity, so that immune cells react strongly to any pathogens that come along. Yet the vaccine also appears to dampen autoimmunity, allergic conditions and inflammation. It may even beef up the ability of certain immune cells to pull glucose out of the bloodstream, a potential help for people with type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>On the flip side, some diabetes researchers and organizations have expressed concerns that Faustman’s work might generate false hope. Most recently, during the 2018 meeting of the American Diabetes Association, that organization, along with JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), released a statement noting the small size of Faustman’s 2018 study, and that all of the volunteers continued taking insulin.</p>



<p>In an e-mail to <em>Science News</em>, a JDRF representative reiterated the original statement, adding: “We want every researcher in our field to be successful and we will be monitoring the progress made by Dr. Faustman.” Several type 1 diabetes researchers turned down requests to comment on Faustman’s latest work, including one who cited the small number of patients involved as a reason.</p>



<p>Leslie agrees that more data are needed to back up Faustman’s claims. He says he has heard negative reactions to Faustman’s work in private, but he doesn’t think they’re warranted. “It’s an interesting idea,” he says, one that “we shouldn’t throw away.”</p>



<p>Faustman has not received any BCG funding from two of the biggest type 1 diabetes research funders: the U.S. National Institutes of Health and JDRF. She says she thinks that’s because the work “flies in the face” of the field’s main efforts over the last 20 years, which include managing glucose levels with pumps and monitors, and detecting and treating type 1 diabetes as early as possible.</p>



<p>Faustman’s BCG work has been supported by private donors, including the Iacocca Family Foundation in Boston, or through fundraising by patients and their families. Because BCG is a generic vaccine costing an average of 50 cents a dose, there is little incentive for drug developers to pour money into studies for new uses. “It’s not sexy or money-making at all,” says Singh, whose own funding for studying BCG-related work dried up in 2001.</p>



<p>“The data will have to speak for themselves,” says Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Levy studies BCG and is familiar with Faustman’s work. He says no one is encouraging people with diabetes to get in line for a shot of BCG. “We need rigorous clinical data,” he says. “But I do think that it’s a plausible hypothesis and very exciting area of research.”</p>



<h3>Eyes on the off-targets</h3>



<p>Faustman is part of a growing community of researchers who study BCG and its unintended effects. She calls them “off-target people.”</p>



<p>One of those researchers is Mihai Netea, an immunologist at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. He and his colleagues have shown that BCG triggers trained immunity, a nonspecific sort of memory that readies immune cells to react more strongly to any pathogen later on. It’s thought that this is how, in human studies, it protects against bacterial and viral infections, and is what’s led several research groups to test it as a prevention against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Netea’s team also reported in 2016 in <em>Cell Reports</em> that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27926861/">one shot of BCG triggers healthy volunteers’ monocytes to break down glucose at a higher rate</a>, and increases the activity of genes required for glucose metabolism within the cells. Netea says he isn’t sure that these changes in immune cells are enough to affect glucose levels throughout the whole body, as Faustman posits.</p>



<p>In its ongoing trial, Faustman’s team is using radioactive glucose PET scanning to map out where the glucose goes after BCG vaccination. So far, they’ve seen increased glucose uptake in some of the places where monocytes and other immune cells are found, such as the spleen, bone marrow and descending aorta. After two years, she says, the liver starts to take up more glucose as well, suggesting it may play a role in BCG’s effect on blood glucose levels.</p>



<p>Faustman has teamed up with Harvard neurologist Steven Arnold to test BCG in Alzheimer’s patients. The breakdown of glucose is lower than normal in the brains of people with the disease, research has shown. Faustman thinks BCG may offer a reboot of glucose metabolism.</p>



<p>In 2019, a research team from Israel reported in <em>PLOS ONE</em> that among people treated for bladder cancer about a decade earlier, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224433">2.4 percent who got BCG developed Alzheimer’s</a> while 8.9 percent of those who didn’t developed the disease. Arnold’s study will enroll 30 people with early Alzheimer’s to receive two shots of BCG or a placebo four weeks apart. His team will measure patients’ cognitive abilities and biomarkers of disease in blood and cerebrospinal fluid over three months.</p>



<p>Faustman’s colleagues in Italy, neurologists Marco Salvetti and Giovanni Ristori of Sapienza University of Rome, have been pursuing BCG as a treatment for multiple sclerosis since the late 1990s. In a pilot study of 12 people with MS, Salvetti, Ristori and colleagues found that BCG reduced the patients’ chances of developing new areas of nerve cell damage in the brain.</p>



<p>For a second trial, the team recruited people who had not yet developed MS, but experienced one episode of MS symptoms, such as vision loss or muscle weakness. Thirty-three of those volunteers got one shot of BCG while 40 got a placebo. Over five years, those who got the vaccine were less likely to develop new or worsened areas of brain damage or experience disease flare-ups compared with people who received a placebo. By the end of the study, 70 percent of the placebo group had clinically diagnosed MS, compared with <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/82/1/41">42 percent of the vaccinated group</a>, the team reported in 2014 in <em>Neurology</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Slow the progress </h4>



<p>Patients who had experienced one episode of multiple sclerosis symptoms but had not been diagnosed with MS were given a shot of BCG (red line) or a placebo (black). Over six months, 33 BCG-treated patients had fewer new areas of brain inflammation (as shown on MRI) than the 40 people who received a placebo. </p>

<p>The Sapienza team has started another placebo-controlled trial recruiting people with signs of neurological damage that had been discovered by chance in MRIs done for unrelated reasons. People with this kind of damage have a high risk of developing MS after several years. Salvetti says he hopes to find out if BCG can serve as an option to lower these people’s risk for MS.</p>



<p>Salvetti is working with immunologist Giuseppe Matarese of the University of Naples Federico II to study the trial participants’ T-regs. Matarese’s group has found that T-regs from MS patients have trouble multiplying. In studies of mice with MS-like symptoms, BCG increases T-reg numbers. Matarese’s team plans to see if it does the same in people. The group is also examining T-regs from healthy volunteers given a single BCG shot in a separate study led by Netea.</p>



<p>Faustman continues to study T-regs. Although her earlier work suggests that BCG boosts breakdown of glucose in people with long-standing type 1 diabetes, she hopes to learn if T-regs can help those more recently diagnosed, whose beta cells may still have a chance to recover. Her team is testing this in a trial of 25 people with newly diagnosed disease. So far, patients in this trial who are under age 21 have experienced drops in HbA1c levels one and two years after receiving BCG, which the team reported last October at the virtual 2020 Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies meeting.</p>



<p>Faustman’s group is halfway through its 150-person Phase II clinical trial, and expects to finish in 2023. She presented unpublished data at the meeting suggesting that the shot increases the activity of a gene required for T-reg production. The HbA1c data are still being analyzed.</p>



<p>In early 2021, she asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval to start a trial in children with type 1 diabetes, but the agency asked her for more animal data. She hopes to go back to ask again later this year.</p>



<p>Accacha, whose practice would participate in the trial, says her patients’ parents are very interested in Faustman’s work, and eager to enroll their children. “They ask me every year, ‘What’s going on?’ ”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Loneliness can be something of a vicious cycle. As <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/">previous research</a> has suggested, your personality can increase your likelihood of being lonely, and loneliness can impact your personality. We also know that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/25/ten-year-study-finds-loneliness-and-self-centeredness-appear-to-be-mutually-reinforcing/">self-centredness</a> can increase loneliness, that being <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/16/being-true-to-yourself-may-protect-against-the-harmful-effects-of-loneliness/">true to yourself</a> can reduce loneliness, and that even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">warming yourself up on a cold day</a> can ease cravings for social contact.</p>



<p>Loneliness, then, is highly dependent on personality factors as well as social factors such as discrimination, limited access to transport, and lack of social cohesion. And a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, identifies another individual factor: low self-control. According to Olga Stavrova and team from Tilburg University in the Netherlands, failures of self-control can have serious social ramifications — leading to ostracism and, eventually, loneliness.</p>



<span id="more-42440"></span>



<p>The first study used data from 2,710 participants taking part in a longitudinal survey in the Netherlands. The team looked specifically at one time point in the study, where participants had answered questions on self-control, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am good at resisting temptation”, and loneliness, responding to statements such as “I have a sense of emptiness around me”.</p>



<p>The researchers also examined participants’ Big Five personality traits, as well as demographic variables that have been previously associated with loneliness — gender, age, whether or not the participant lived alone or with partners or children, education, employment status, and income.</p>



<p>The results showed that lower self-control predicts higher loneliness, an effect similar in size to that of some other predictors of loneliness such as low levels of extraversion and agreeableness (however, low emotional stability was a much stronger predictor than low self-control).</p>



<p>A second study looked at day-to-day feelings of loneliness. Participants took part in a daily diary exercise, writing every day for a week about how lonely they had felt, and how often they had given in to a temptation. They also completed a measure of “trait” levels of self-control to measure base levels.</p>



<p>Again, those with lower trait self-control were more likely to experience loneliness. Furthermore, those who reported failures in self-control on one day were also more likely to report loneliness in their diary on the subsequent day.</p>



<p>Why might lower self-control lead to loneliness? The researchers wondered whether low self-control signals that someone is not trustworthy, and so makes them more likely to be ostracised by others. So in another study, they asked participants to read a short paragraph about Robin, a (fabricated) previous participant who was having problems saving money but who nonetheless had ended up in an expensive electronics shop. In the low self-control condition, participants read that Robin had bought himself a new smartphone — even though he didn’t need one — while the high self-control condition heard that Robin had resisted temptation and left the shop empty-handed.</p>



<p>They were then asked to imagine that Robin was a new co-worker and to indicate how likely they were to exclude him, and whether they thought he was likely to care for or take time for others, or engage in behaviours that could hurt others.</p>



<p>Consistent with their predictions, the team found that participants in the low self-control condition were more likely to ostracise Robin, which could partly be explained by the fact that they also perceived him as less prosocial and more likely to engage in selfish, potentially harmful behaviour. A final study found that participants with low self-control themselves reported experiencing greater experience of ostracism and more loneliness.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that low self-control can increase loneliness — and that this increase occurs partly via social ostracism due to selfish impulses or potentially harmful behaviour. This makes sense — you may be more likely to be faithful to a partner or co-operate at work or in a game if you have higher self-control, which could make you seem more desirable as a friend, partner, or social contact.</p>



<p>There are other explanations, however. Those with low self-control may be ostracising <em>themselves</em> — if you feel guilty or ashamed after a lapse in self-control, you might want to isolate yourself to deal with those feelings rather than being specifically excluded by others.</p>



<p>Future work could look at different kinds of self-control failure. If you fail to keep to a diet, for example, it only affects you — so would that lead to the same kind of ostracism that someone who can’t stop cheating on their partner might face? The team suggests that loneliness is more (or only) likely to occur when our actions have social repercussions; a closer look at this dynamic may shed more light on the relationship between ostracism, self-control and our social lives.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228">Low Self-Control: A Hidden Cause of Loneliness?</a></p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper "Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.</p>

<p>Tardigrades aren’t completely bulletproof, after all.</p>



<p>These microscopic critters, also known as water bears, are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-bears-will-survive-end-world-we-know-it">practically unkillable</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/17</em>). They can go years without food or water, withstand freezing and scalding temperatures and endure blistering radiation and the vacuum of outer space. But a recent experiment stress tested these death-defying creatures in a new way: by firing tardigrades from a gun.</p>



<p>Tardigrades <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2405">survived smashing into targets</a> at speeds up to about 825 meters per second, researchers report online May 11 in <em>Astrobiology</em>. But speedier water bears blew apart on impact. The findings hint that even intrepid little animals like tardigrades would struggle to survive crash-landing on a new planet.</p>



<p>That puts new limits on the possibility of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bacteria-band-together-survival-years-astrobiology">panspermia</a> — organisms hitchhiking between worlds on planetary debris kicked up by meteorite impacts (<em>SN: 8/26/20</em>). Knowing whether life is up to the challenge of planet-hopping could help answer how life got started on Earth and gauge the risk of Earthly lifeforms on spacecraft contaminating other places in the solar system, says Samuel Halim, a planetary scientist at Birkbeck, University of London not involved in the work.</p>





<p>The inspiration to test water bears’ ability to withstand high-speed impacts came from the tardigrade-toting Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-moon-mission-spacecraft-crash">which crashed into the moon</a> in 2019 (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). “I wondered, are these tardigrades alive?” says astrobiologist Alejandra Traspas Muiña of Queen Mary University of London.</p>



<p>After freezing <em>Hypsibius dujardini</em> tardigrades to put them in a state of suspended animation, Traspas Muiña and planetary scientist Mark Burchell of the University of Kent in England loaded the dormant water bears into nylon bullets. The researchers fired those bullets from a five-meter-long instrument called a two-stage light gas gun, which looks more like a cannon than a firearm. The machine launched tardigrades at different speeds, ranging from about 550 to 1,000 meters per second, into bags of sand meant to mimic the lunar surface.</p>



<p>Smashing into sand faster than about 825 meters per second, or about one gigapascal of shock pressure, proved lethal for the tardigrades. But even surviving water bears didn’t escape unscathed. After being placed in water, they took up to 36 hours to recover. Water bears that were frozen and thawed without being pelted into sand bounced back within nine hours.</p>



<p>These results suggest the Beresheet tardigrades probably didn’t survive their lunar landing, Traspas Muiña says. Likewise, space rocks flying around the solar system usually smash into planets and moons at thousands of meters per second — far too fast for tardigrades to survive. But splashing down in water might offer a softer landing, she says. “It’s hard for [animals like water bears] to survive panspermia in the solar system, but it could happen.”</p>



<p>Microbes, which are tinier and hardier than water bears, might stand a better chance of migrating between planets. Other research has suggested these organisms can withstand impacts up to thousands of meters per second, albeit at survival rates around or below one in 10,000. “There’s also much tougher tardigrades out there” than the species tested in this experiment, says evolutionary biologist Jason Pienaar of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who wasn’t involved in the work. He wonders whether other kinds of water bears might prove more splatter-proof. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-developing-countries-cost">Vaccinating people in developing countries costs far less than doing nothing</a></h4>

<p>As the United States and other nations celebrate what looks like the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic — with a quarter to half their populations vaccinated — many less well-off countries are lagging far behind. Some have vaccinated <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/">less than 1 percent</a> of their populations, leaving them vulnerable to emerging coronavirus variants and at risk for future surges.</p>



<p>Now a new analysis puts a price tag on what it would cost those countries to catch up. Getting shots to half the adult population of the world’s lowest-income countries in 2021 <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/one-for-all-updated-action-plan-for-global-covid-19-vaccination/">will cost $9.3 billion</a>, the Rockefeller Foundation, a global charitable foundation based in New York City, reports June 1. That estimate includes <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/92-low-middle-income-economies-eligible-access-covid-19-vaccines-gavi-covax-amc">92 nations</a> (representing about 3.8 billion people) that are eligible for vaccine access through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public–private global health partnership based in Geneva. With that money, the Alliance could purchase 1.8 billion vaccine doses.</p>



<p>If COVID-19 vaccine doses had been distributed equitably to every nation, these doses “would have been enough to cover <a href="https://worldhealthorganization.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/d/4D75B0F008F6B83F2540EF23F30FEDED/BD95C7108E817C31DCCB6820C4466A74">all health workers and older </a><a href="https://worldhealthorganization.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/d/4D75B0F008F6B83F2540EF23F30FEDED/BD95C7108E817C31DCCB6820C4466A74">people</a>” by now, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a May 24 assembly of the organization’s member states.</p>



<p>The fallout of failing to vaccinate people in countries with fewer resources <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">will come with a high cost</a> not only for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-india-crisis-social-distancing-masks-variant">human life</a> — there have been more than 3.5 million COVID-19 deaths so far — but also the global bottom line (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>; <em>SN: 5/9/21</em>). The word’s economy <a href="https://iccwbo.org/publication/the-economic-case-for-global-vaccinations/">stands to lose more than $9 trillion</a> if lower-income countries aren’t able to access vaccines, the International Chamber of Commerce estimates.</p>





<p>The Rockefeller report focuses on vaccinations in 2021 because recent coronavirus variants —such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-p1-variant-brazil-strain-transmission-immunity">P.1, first identified in Brazil</a> and B.1.617, discovered in India — have demonstrated the virus’s capacity to evolve, potentially beyond the existing tools that the world has at its disposal (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>). Waiting until 2022 will be too late, says Christy Feig, the Rockefeller Foundation’s director of communications and advocacy. To date, many vaccines have been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccine-questions-immunity-variants">protect people from serious illness and death</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/21</em>).  </p>



<p>“The pandemic itself has gone beyond a health crisis — it has now gone into an economic crisis,” Feig says. “The only way to unchoke the economy is by getting the vaccines to as many countries as possible, so that we can stop the spread of the disease before more variants come.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-bursts-spiral-arms-galaxies">Some fast radio bursts come from the spiral arms of other galaxies</a></h4>

<p>Five brief, bright blasts of radio waves from deep space now have precise addresses.</p>



<p>The fast radio bursts, or FRBs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11617.pdf">come from the spiral arms of their host galaxies</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The proximity of the FRBs to sites of star formation bolsters the case for run-of-the-mill young stars as the origin of these elusive, energetic eruptions.</p>



<p>“This is the first such population study of its kind and provides a unique piece to the puzzle of FRB origins,” says Wen-fai Fong, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>FRBs typically last a few milliseconds and are never seen again. Because the bursts are so brief, it’s difficult to nail down their precise origins on the sky. Although astronomers have detected about 1,000 FRBs since the first was reported in 2007, only 15 or so have been traced to a specific galaxy.</p>





<p>The first burst to be traced to its source came from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gotcha-fast-radio-bursts-home-nabbed">small, blobby dwarf galaxy</a> with a lot of active star formation (<em>SN: 1/4/17</em>). That FRB sends off repeated blasts from a single source, which is an unusual feature, and helped astronomers localize its host galaxy.</p>



<p>“After that, a lot of people thought, well, maybe all FRB hosts are like this,” says astronomer Alexandra Mannings of the University of California, Santa Cruz. But then a second repeating burst was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/home-galaxy-second-repeating-fast-radio-burst-is-puzzle">tracked back to a spiral galaxy</a> like the Milky Way (<em>SN: 1/6/20</em>). And a one-off burst was localized to a massive disk-shaped galaxy, also the size of the Milky Way. Others followed.</p>



<p>Mannings, Fong and colleagues thought they could learn more about the FRBs’ sources by localizing their origins even more precisely. Different parts of spiral galaxies tend to host different types of stars. The bright spiral arms tend to mark sites where new stars are being born, while the older and dimmer stars have had time to drift away from the arms into the rest of the galaxy. So figuring out which galactic neighborhoods FRBs call home can reveal a lot about what kind of objects they come from.</p>



<p>Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers took high-resolution images of eight galaxies that were already known to host FRBs, then overlaid the FRBs’ positions onto the images. The five FRBs that came from clearly defined spiral galaxies all lay on or close to the galaxies’ spiral arms, which had not been visible in images from ground-based telescopes. The other three host galaxies had inconclusive shapes, Fong says.</p>



<p>The FRB locales have a fair amount of star formation, but they’re not the brightest and most active parts of their galaxies, Fong says. That suggests FRBs originate with ordinary young stars — not the youngest, most massive stars that occupy the brightest knots in the spiral arms, but not the oldest and dimmest stars that have drifted away from their homes, either.</p>



<p>That finding is consistent with the idea that FRBs come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">highly magnetized stellar corpses called magnetars</a>, Mannings says (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). There are a couple of ways to produce magnetars from ordinary stars. There’s the slow way, which involves waiting billions of years for a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">pair of neutron stars to collide</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). Or there’s the fast way, which follows the death of a single massive star. It seems like FRBs might come from an in-between process, like the death of a not-so-massive star, Mannings says.</p>



<p>“The fact that FRBs are found to be pretty close to, if not on, the spiral arm, near to these star forming regions, that can give us a better idea of what the timeline is like for the progenitor,” whatever created the FRB, Mannings says. “And if it is a magnetar, it lets us know that it’s not through the delayed channel, like a neutron star merger.”</p>



<p>The finding doesn’t entirely solve the mystery of where FRBs come from, says astrophysicist Emily Petroff of the University of Amsterdam, who was not involved in the new work. But it does help to get a broader picture of their host galaxies.</p>



<p>“FRBs keep throwing a lot of surprises at us, in terms of what they look like, where they’re found, how they repeat,” Petroff says. “This is maybe providing more evidence that FRBs are more related to just sort of general neutron stars.” The next step, of course, is to find more FRBs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis">Here’s what we know about the risks of serious side effects from COVID-19 vaccines</a></h4>

<p>Many people have experienced sore arms and feeling wiped out for a couple of days after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Some get fevers, chills and headaches. Those familiar side effects have become widely accepted as the price of protection against the too-often-deadly coronavirus.</p>



<p>But it’s the rare, more serious side effects that have grabbed the headlines — and given some people pause about whether to get vaccinated or get the shots for their children.</p>



<p>Such side effects include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-severe-allergic-reactions-extremely-rare-cdc">rare allergic reactions</a> to an ingredient in the mRNA vaccines (<em>SN: 1/6/21</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-janssen-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-resume-pause-rare-blood-clot">rare blood clots in young women</a> associated with Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine (<em>SN: 4/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, a group that monitors vaccine safety for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating whether there is a link between Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine and a few <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/work-groups-vast/technical-report-2021-05-17.html">mild cases of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in adolescents and young adults</a>. So far, cases of myocarditis have not risen above the number normally expected in young people, and no one actually knows whether the vaccine triggers the heart inflammation or not.</p>





<p>“We are seeing these potential side effects because we are looking for them, and that’s a perfect example of how our safety system is supposed to work,” says Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “We’re being very aggressive and proactive, and that’s good.” </p>



<p>Here’s what is known, the experts say: The risk of serious side effects from vaccination remains far smaller than its benefits. The vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccine-questions-immunity-variants">even against variants</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/21</em>). The vaccines may also help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease">block infection and transmission</a> of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 3/30/21</em>).</p>

<p>As of May 28, worldwide, more than 1.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given, according to Johns Hopkins University. No vaccines are completely risk-free, says Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. But the side effects known to be caused by the vaccines are usually short-lived and clear up on their own or are treatable or reversible, she says.</p>



<p>Out of every million doses given of the mRNA vaccines, overall about 2.5 to 11.1 severe allergic reactions to an ingredient called <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cea.13874">polyethylene glycol</a> will happen. That’s why people are typically monitored for at least 15 minutes after the shot. The risk is obviously highest for people who have known allergies to polyethylene glycol and they should probably avoid taking the mRNA vaccines. If the <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0104">jabs are broken down into smaller doses</a>, people with the rare allergies might still be able to get the shots safely, researchers reported in April in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>A small number of people who have facial fillers made of hyaluronic acid may get swelling around their fillers a few days after a shot of an mRNA vaccine. The <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-3-6-may-2021">European Medicines Agency recommended that the vaccine makers warn people</a> of the possible reaction. In Moderna’s clinical trial, three people developed the swelling. <a href="https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(21)00658-7/fulltext">Nine other cases</a> were associated with either the Pfizer or Moderna shots, researchers reported April 7 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s not a high number,” says Herluf Lund, a plastic surgeon in St. Louis, Mo., and the immediate past president of the Aesthetic Society. “But it’s also not unheard of, because it’s not just the COVID vaccines that are tied to this; almost any vaccine can be tied to this swelling around fillers.” Illnesses can also trigger the swelling. The reaction isn’t an allergic reaction, it’s a side effect of revving up the immune system. “The immune system when it first starts up is a bit like a shotgun; it fires and hopes it hits something,” he says. Once the immune system recognizes the vaccine or virus as its target, the swelling goes away.</p>



<p>The swelling isn’t dangerous and usually clears up quickly, either on its own or after taking antihistamines or steroids. “It, of course, scares the heck out of the patient,” Lund says. “But don’t run to the emergency room,” he says. “Just pick up the phone and call your doctor.”</p>



<p>About 13 cases of rare blood clots are predicted to develop in women 49 and younger for every one million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine. Only two such clots for every million doses are calculated to happen in women 50 and older or in men 18- to 49-years old. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-blood-clot-immune-astrazeneca-johnson-johnson">test can identify an uncommon immune response</a> that is leading to those clots, ensuring patients can get the right care (<em>SN: 4/16/21</em>).</p>

<p>Those handfuls of side effect cases per every million doses of vaccine are lower “than your chance of getting bit by a shark if you go to the beach, of getting hit by a car if you cross the street, or being killed in an airplane crash,” Maldonado says. “And yet we seem to go to the beach, cross the street and get on airplanes every single day.”</p>



<p>On the other hand, more than 169 million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than 3.5 million have died worldwide. That includes more than 33 million cases and 593,000 deaths in the United States. Overall, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm">COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death</a> — behind heart disease and cancer — in the United States in 2020, and ranks in the country’s top 10 leading causes of death for children.</p>



<p>People may think a vaccine is responsible for a health problem if it happens soon after getting a shot, Maldonado says. But that problem may have happened anyway even if the person didn’t get a vaccine, she says. “There may be a temporal association, but not a causal one.”</p>



<p>But, she notes, “people just get nervous because it’s new.” While the speed at which the vaccines have made it into people’s arms is unprecedented, the technology behind them has been in development for years, she says. “These are probably the most highly studied vaccines ever.”</p>



<p>That ongoing surveillance is what alerted public health officials to instances of myocarditis happening post-vaccination. The CDC hasn’t reported how many children have been affected by myocarditis after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, but said that the number of cases is still within what’s called background levels. In any given year, doctors expect to see about two cases of myocarditis for every 100,000 children, Yonts says, but that may be an underestimate. Some children may have indicators of inflammation in their blood, but don’t develop symptoms. Those “subclinical” cases aren’t included in the counts.</p>



<p>Typically, infants and teenagers are more likely to develop the condition than pre-adolescent children. The cases being investigated for a link to the vaccine have happened in older teens and young adults, more commonly in males than females, and have tended to happen about four days after the second shot.  </p>



<p>Viruses are the most commonly implicated cause of myocarditis, Yonts says. The inflammation is a product of the immune system trying to fight off the infection. Since vaccines prime the immune system, too, it is possible that a COVID-19 vaccine might trigger the heart problem in some kids. Other vaccines, particularly the smallpox vaccine, have been associated with rare cases of myocarditis in the past, she says.  </p>



<p>But there has not yet been any cause and effect established between myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccines, stresses Yonts, who previously worked in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine evaluation branch.</p>



<p>Doctors are being urged to be on the lookout for the symptoms of myocarditis in their young patients and to report any problems. Yonts says two kids, and possibly a third, who were seen at Children’s National Hospital have fit the overall pattern of mild myocarditis symptoms that might be a side effect of the vaccine.</p>



<p>Such symptoms include chest pain, which may get worse when kids are lying down; faster or irregular heartbeats; shortness of breath; and dizziness upon standing up or being more active. Those symptoms come after the more common vaccine side effects, such as fatigue, body aches and chills. The myocarditis cases seen after vaccination have all been mild and went away on their own within a day of developing symptoms, Yonts says.   </p>



<p>COVID-19 itself sometimes causes myocarditis. For instance, of 1,597 college athletes who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were found to have <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548">signs of myocarditis</a>, researchers report May 27 in <em>JAMA Cardiology</em>.</p>



<p>The disease can have other consequences, too, Yonts says, including long-COVID and an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-complications-inflammation-rare-cases">over-the-top inflammatory syndrome</a> called MIS-C, which may lead to organ failure and death (<em>SN: 5/12/20</em>). That condition can develop four to six weeks after even very mild cases of COVID-19. And while COVID-19 is generally milder in children than adults, plenty of children get severe cases of COVID-19, she says. “In my practice, I’ve seen many kids admitted to the ICU, who require blood pressure support, or are severely ill with COVID-19. I have seen far more of those at this point than I have seen of the very mild symptoms of myocarditis.”</p>

A pair of psychology journals have retracted two related papers on the health benefits of a popular form of transcendental meditation after a reader pointed out that the authors failed to report the primary outcome of the study underpinning the articles. The now-retracted articles describe the putatively salubrious effects of sahaj samadhi meditation, a form … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/01/two-transcendental-meditation-papers-retracted-for-failures-to-report-primary-outcomes/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Two transcendental meditation papers retracted for failures to report primary outcomes</span></a>

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7" target="_blank">Erik Hoel (2021)</a>:<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of <i>overfitting</i>,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[sic]</span></span> hypothesis.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  </p><p>In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”</p><blockquote><p>The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). <br /><b>. . .</b><br /></p><p>To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">artificial neural networks</a> for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015. The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html" target="_blank">DeepDream</a> program is a visualization tool that shows what the layers of the neural network have learned:</p><blockquote>One way to visualize what goes on is to turn the network upside down and ask it to enhance an input image in such a way as to elicit a particular interpretation. </blockquote><p><br />The image above is characteristic of the hallucinogenic output from the DeepDream web interface, and it illustrates that the original training set was filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724110554/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/50616707-deepdream-avoiding-kitsch" target="_blank">dogs, birds, and pagodas</a>.  DeepDream images inspired blog posts with titles like, <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep" target="_blank">Do neural nets dream of electric sheep?</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/07/google-deepdream-its-dazzling-creepy-and-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-future-of-a-i.html" target="_blank">Do Androids Dream of Electric Bananas?</a> and my favorite, <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/07/scary-brains-and-garden-of-earthly-deep.html">Scary Brains and the Garden of Earthly Deep Dreams</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Reference</b></p><p>Hoel E.

<p>The hard, magnetic teeth of a leathery red-brown mollusk nicknamed “the wandering meatloaf” possess <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/The%20hard%20magnetic%20teeth%20of%20a%20leathery%20red-brown%20mollusk%20nicknamed%20">a rare mineral previously seen only in rocks</a>. The mineral may help the mollusk — the giant Pacific chiton (<em>Cryptochiton stelleri</em>) — meld its soft flesh to the hard teeth it uses for grazing on rocky coastlines, researchers report online May 31 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p><em>C. stelleri</em> is the world’s largest chiton, reaching up to roughly 35 centimeters long. It is equipped with several dozen rows of teeth on a slender, flexible, tonguelike appendage called a radula that it uses to scrape algae off rocks. Those teeth are covered in magnetite, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970211070016X">the hardest, stiffest known biomineral </a>to date: It’s as much as three times as hard as human enamel and mollusk shells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="C. stelleri's tongue lined with teeth" class="wp-image-3100048" height="104" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/052721_choi_chiton-teeth_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3100048"><em>C. stelleri</em> uses its radula, a tonguelike structure (pictured) studded with hard magnetic teeth (dark objects), to graze on rocks. This composite image shows the radula’s stages of development, from earliest (left) to latest (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3100048">Northwestern University</span></figure>



<p>Materials scientist Derk Joester and colleagues analyzed these teeth using high-energy X-rays from the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill. They discovered that the interface between the teeth and flesh contained nanoparticles of <a href="https://www.schweizerbart.de/papers/ejm/detail/15/54934/Santabarbaraite_a_new_amorphous_phosphate_mineral?af=crossref">santabarbaraite</a>, an iron-loaded mineral never seen before in a living organism’s body.</p>



<p>These nanoparticles help the underpinnings of the teeth vary in hardness and stiffness by at least a factor of two over distances of just several hundred micrometers — a few times the average width of a human hair. Such variations let these structures bridge the hard and soft parts of the mollusk’s body. Now that santabarbaraite has been found in one organism, the researchers suggest looking for it in insect cuticles and bacteria that sense magnetic fields.</p>

<p>Using nanoparticles of a mineral similar to santabarbaraite, the scientists also 3-D printed strong, light materials with a range of hardness and stiffness. These composites might find use in soft robotics, including marrying soft and hard parts in bots that can squirm past obstacles that conventional robots cannot given their rigid parts, says Joester, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/molecule-models-blind-protein-candy-chemistry">A sweet father-son bond inspires tasty new molecule models</a></h4>

<p>Thirteen-year-old Noah Shaw loves planets and has perfect pitch. He wants to be a scientist like his father Bryan Shaw, a biochemist at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. But Noah’s path to science may not be as smooth as it was for the elder Shaw.</p>



<p>Diagnosed with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/retinoblastoma-unmasking-cancer">retinoblastoma</a> as an infant (<em>SN: 1/5/85</em>), Noah now has only one eye and permanent blind spots in his vision. People with one eye, like Noah, and people who have blindness or limited vision, are underrepresented in science and face barriers in STEM education. “Most of the stunning imagery in science is inaccessible to people who are blind,” Bryan Shaw says. That makes him wistful because renderings of proteins hooked him on science.</p>



<p>In an effort to help make science more inclusive, Shaw and his colleagues have come up with bite-sized molecule models that take advantage of the mouth’s supersensitive touch sensors, which can perceive finer details than our fingertips can.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Brian Shaw and his son Noah, sitting on a curb outside, smiling at the camera" class="wp-image-3099922" height="506" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051721_cd_gummy-model_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3099922">Biochemist Bryan Shaw (left) — inspired by his son Noah (right) whose vision was affected by cancer — created edible and nonedible models of proteins that students can explore with their mouths.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099922">Courtesy of Elizabeth Shaw</span></figure>



<p>The team created gummy candy models of important proteins, including myoglobin, which provides oxygen to muscles, and also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-method-leaves-older-ways-3-d-printing-its-goopy-wake">3-D printed</a> nonedible, nontoxic versions (<em>SN: 3/16/15</em>). Both can be popped in the mouth for investigation. Once the researchers attached lanyards to the nonedible models to prevent choking, the team tested how well 281 college students and 31 grade schoolers could tell edible or nonedible models apart while blindfolded.</p>



<p>Each student examined one protein model either by mouth or by hand. For every additional protein model that the students assessed, they had to determine whether the protein was the same as the first or different. A separate group of 84 college students did the test by eyesight with 3-D computer images of proteins instead of models.</p>





<p>Students <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh0691">correctly identified the proteins about 85 percent of the time</a>, regardless of whether they used their mouths, fingers or eyes, the team reports May 28 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Such cheap, tiny models could help students learn about proteins regardless of vision acuity, Shaw says.</p>



<p>Shaw got the idea for this would-be educational tool while twirling a blackberry on his tongue. A blackberry’s bumpy exterior looks like a popular way that scientists depict proteins, in which each of the protein’s atoms is represented by a sphere. Stick thousands of atoms together, and the conglomerate resembles an elaborate berry — something the tongue might be able to tell apart by shape.</p>



<p>Many infants and toddlers explore the world by mouth. A student in Hong Kong made headlines in 2013 for teaching herself to read Braille with her lips. Yet the mouth’s remarkable sensing ability remains largely untapped in science education, Shaw says. </p>



<p>Shaw has patented the models and is eager for feedback. But taking the models from prototype to teaching tool will require more work. For instance, the researchers have access to professional equipment to print models and sterilize them between uses — something not all educators have.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the models would benefit from testing by students who are blind and those who have low vision. Input from these students will help Shaw’s team improve the models to better fit the students’ needs. Shaw has initiated conversations about the models with educators at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired in Austin. Noah did test the models, but the researchers didn’t include his data in the analysis.</p>



<p>This is not the first time that Noah has inspired his dad. Shaw previously codeveloped an app that has the potential to catch early signs of eye disease in childhood pictures. Regardless of whether Noah pursues science, his father has one wish: “I hope he does something cool.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/helium-rain-jupiter-pressure-laser-experiments-physics">Laser experiments suggest helium rain falls on Jupiter</a></h4>

<p>Sprinkles of helium rain may fall on Jupiter.</p>



<p>At pressures and temperatures present within the gas giant, the hydrogen and helium that make up the bulk of its atmosphere <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03516-0">don’t mix</a>, according to laboratory experiments reported in the May 27 <em>Nature</em>. That suggests that deep within Jupiter’s atmosphere, hydrogen and helium separate, with the helium forming droplets that are denser than the hydrogen, causing them to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-rain-drop-size-limit-alien-planets">rain down</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Jupiter’s marbled exterior is pretty familiar territory, but it’s still not clear what happens far below the cloud tops. So researchers designed an experiment to compress hydrogen and helium, reaching pressures nearly 2 million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure and temperatures of thousands of degrees Celsius, akin to inner layers of gas giants.</p>



<p>“We are reproducing the conditions inside the planets,” says physicist Marius Millot of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.</p>





<p>Millot and colleagues squeezed a mixture of hydrogen and helium between two diamonds and hit the concoction with a powerful laser to compress it even further. As the pressure and temperature increased, the researchers saw an abrupt increase in how reflective the material was. That suggests that helium was separating from the hydrogen, which becomes a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pressure-make-metallic-hydrogen">liquid metal</a> under these conditions (<em>SN: 8/10/16</em>). At even higher pressures and temperatures, the reflectivity decreased, suggesting that hydrogen and helium began mixing again.</p>



<p>The researchers calculated that hydrogen and helium would separate about 11,000 kilometers below the cloud tops of Jupiter, down to a depth of about 22,000 kilometers.</p>



<p>The results could help scientists explain observations made by spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-jupiter-goodbye-tour">Galileo</a> (<em>SN: 2/18/02</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-polar-cyclones-planet">Juno</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/18</em>), such as the fact that Jupiter’s outer layers of atmosphere have less helium than expected.</p>

<p><strong>Electric fish seem to have mastered the art of the pause</strong>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/electric-fish-pause/618993/">writes Katherine J. Wu</a> at <em>The Atlantic</em>. <em>Brienomyrus brachyistius </em>communicate by producing a series of electrical pulses. But researchers have found that the fish sometimes pause during their “conversations”, apparently as a signal that what they are about to communicate is important — similar to a “dramatic pause” in human speech.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have allowed a bind man to see again after 40 years, through the use of light-sensitive proteins injected into cells in the eye. </strong>With the help of specialised goggles, the man was able to make out high-contrast images, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01421-0">reports Sara Reardon</a> at <em>Nature</em>. The study represents the first clinical use of optogenetics, a technique often used in basic neuroscience research. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>..and in other optogenetics news, researchers have used the technique to manipulate social behaviours in mice. </strong>After inducing synchronous patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex of two mice, the team found that the animals became more social, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/science/optogenetics-brain-social-behavior.html">reports Virginia Hughes</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>. The work has interesting parallels with that on “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/">interbrain synchrony” in humans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Psychologists surely know enough about the replication crisis now to avoid uncritically citing work known to have issues… right? </strong>Not according to a recent study, which looked at how often researchers cite work that has failed to replicate, compared to more robust findings. The team found that studies with replication issues were cited 153 times more often than those without, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/for-research-citations-no-replication-is-no-problem/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica </em>— and those citations rarely mentioned the fact that the original paper had not replicated.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunter-gatherers-warfare-stone-age-jebel-sahaba">Hunter-gatherers first launched violent raids at least 13,400 years ago</a></h4>

<p>More than 8,000 years before the rise of Egyptian civilization, hunter-gatherers went on the attack in the Nile Valley.</p>



<p>Skeletons of adults, teens and children excavated in the 1960s at an ancient cemetery in Sudan known as Jebel Sahaba display injuries incurred in repeated skirmishes, raids or ambushes, say paleoanthropologist Isabelle Crevecoeur and her colleagues. The site, which dates to between 13,400 and 18,600 years ago, provides the oldest known evidence of regular, small-scale conflicts among human groups, says Crevecoeur, of the University of Bordeaux in France.</p>



<p>Although people buried at Jebel Sahaba don’t show signs of having fought in a one-time battle, they participated <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89386-y">in an early form of sporadic warfare</a>, the researchers conclude May 27 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“Repeated violent episodes were probably triggered by well-recorded environmental changes” around the time people were buried at Jebel Sahaba, Crevecoeur says.</p>





<p>Signs of human activity declined sharply in the Nile Valley between around 126,000 and 11,700 years ago. Toward the end of that span, hunter-gatherers occupied floodplains in what’s now southern Egypt and northern Sudan. As the Ice Age waned, a fluctuating climate contributed to declines in prime fishing and hunting spots. Competition for those resources probably triggered fighting among regional groups, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>The new report fits a scenario in which ancient, possibly culturally distinct communities violently raided each other when dwindling resources threatened their survival, says bioarchaeologist Christopher Stojanowski of Arizona State University in Tempe, who has studied the Jebel Sahaba remains but did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Ancient people carefully dug graves for their dead at Jebel Sahaba, interring bodies in similar, flexed postures. “So amidst the apparent hardship, amidst the apparent violence and tragedy, we still see humanity here,” Stojanowski says.</p>



<p>Out of 61 Jebel Sahaba skeletons held at the British Museum in London, 41 have at least one healed or unhealed injury, Crevecoeur and colleagues report. A majority of that damage was caused by stone spears, arrow points or close combat, the scientists say. Microscopic analysis also shows that 16 individuals had both healed and unhealed injuries, suggesting they had experienced repeated violent incidents during their lives.</p>



<p>Men, women and children from Jebel Sahaba display similar types and proportions of weapon wounds. That injury pattern more likely arose from periodic, indiscriminate raids rather than a single battle, in which the dead would have consisted mainly of male fighters, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Most of the 132 stone artifacts found in the Jebel Sahaba graves were pieces of the sharpened tips of spears or arrows, they say. Some of these finds were embedded in bones and bordered by damage created by hard impacts.</p>

<p>“Violence towards this community was truly extensive and indiscriminate in terms of age and sex,” says biological anthropologist Marta Mirazón Lahr of the University of Cambridge. Previously, she and colleagues reported skeletal evidence from a Kenyan site called Nataruk of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/attack-10000-years-ago-earliest-known-act-warfare">a massacre of 12  hunter-gatherers between roughly 9,500 and 10,500 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/16</em>).</p>



<p>An attack by a neighboring group best explains injuries on the Nataruk remains, Lahr says, which in her view were too scattered and broken up to have been intentionally buried. But Stojanowski and his colleagues contend that damage to and dispersal of some Nataruk bones could have been caused <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19778">by soil compression after bodies were intentionally buried</a>, probably at different times.</p>



<p>Researchers have long debated whether warfare originated among Stone Age hunter-gatherers or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/war-arose-recently-anthropologists-contend">among state societies within roughly the past 6,000 years</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/13</em>). Isolated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-blow-skull-earliest-evidence-murder-430000-year-old-whodunit">fossil cases of violence and murder</a> date back to around 430,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/27/15</em>).</p>



<p>It’s hard to precisely estimate the frequency of violent attacks among ancient hunter-gatherers in Africa and elsewhere, says archaeologist Mark Allen of Cal Poly Pomona. The new Jebel Sahaba report suggests that competition for limited resources has long sparked lethal raiding among these groups, he says. Allen and his colleagues have found that skeletal evidence of violence among <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/43/12120">California hunter-gatherers from around 1,530 to 230 years ago</a> peaked during times of resource scarcity.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size: 20px;">On May 30, 1921, Dick Rowland, a 19-year-old Black shoe shiner, walked into an elevator in downtown Tulsa, Okla. What happened next is unclear, but it sparked the Tulsa race massacre, one of the worst episodes of racial violence in U.S. history, with a death toll estimated in the hundreds.</p>



<p>A century later, researchers are still trying to find the bodies of the victims. A new excavation has brought renewed hope that these individuals could one day be found and identified.</p>



<p>By some accounts, Rowland may have tripped and bumped the arm of a 17-year-old white elevator operator named Sarah Page. Others said he stepped on her foot. Some recalled hearing her scream. Others wondered if the two had been sweet on each other and had a sort of lovers’ quarrel. Whatever happened, it was a dangerous time for a young Black man to be caught in a precarious situation with a young white woman.</p>



<p>Tulsa’s population had skyrocketed to over 100,000 people. Most of the city’s African American residents, about 11,000, lived in a section called Greenwood. The neighborhood’s concentration of thriving entrepreneurs earned it the nickname “<a href="https://greenwoodculturalcenter.com/black-wall-street">Black Wall Street</a>” from Booker T. Washington in the early 1910s.</p>



<p>Greenwood became an oasis from racial prejudice and violence, says Alicia Odewale, a native Tulsan and archaeologist at the University of Tulsa. “You could buy land, create businesses and raise families.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="black and white image of a Greenwood avenue street scene prior to 1921" class="wp-image-3099912" height="700" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/061921_tulsa_inline_streetview-before.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3099912">At the turn of the century, all-Black towns sprouted up across Oklahoma’s prairies. Greenwood was one such community. Many <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/529047-the-creek-freedmen-push-for-indigenous-tribal-rights">Creek freedmen</a> — people previously enslaved by the Muscogee Creek Nation and emancipated in 1866 — had already settled in the area and owned land as tribe members. Drawn by the oil and railroad industries and the prospect of land ownership, the African American community grew. In 1921, Greenwood had its own hospital, school system, newspapers, and over 100 Black-owned businesses, including 41 markets, 30 restaurants, 11 boarding houses, nine pool halls and five hotels.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099912">NMAAHC</span></figure>



<p>But amid its prosperity, Tulsa was extremely segregated: Oklahoma passed a Jim Crow law immediately after it became a state in 1907, the Ku Klux Klan had a hand in local politics, and lynching was common. Tulsa reflected the racial tensions and violence across the United States after World War I. “There’s sort of a national pandemic of racial terror that’s happening, and Tulsa is unfortunately one city among a hundred,” Odewale says.</p>



<p>The day after the elevator incident, Rowland was arrested on a dubious charge of assault. Rumors circulated that he might be lynched. That night, white mobs invaded Greenwood, setting fires, destroying property, looting shops and murdering Black residents. Instead of protecting the neighborhood, law enforcement handed out weapons and deputized white attackers. Machine gun fire echoed through Greenwood’s streets, and private planes dropped explosives and fired on those who fled.</p>





<p>For 24 hours, Tulsa was a war zone.</p>



<p>By the evening of June 1, 35 square blocks smoldered, thousands of homes and businesses lay in ruin and a still unknown number of people were dead in the streets. A Red Cross report from 1921 suggests that about 800 people were wounded and 300 people died in the massacre, though the toll recorded by Oklahoma’s vital statistics bureau was just 36: 26 Black people and 10 white.</p>

<p>A long history of racism, denial, deflection and cover up of the massacre has left deep wounds in the city’s Black communities. A century later, Tulsans still have questions: How many people died? Who were they? And where are they buried?</p>



<p>Answers to some of those questions now seem within reach thanks to an investigation that in October 2020 unearthed a mass grave believed to hold massacre victims. The finding brings some of those who lost their lives one step closer to being laid to rest properly. Future steps could involve DNA analysis to put names to the remains and possibly to reunite the dead with their families. But that prospect also raises concerns about privacy. Survivors and descendants have also renewed their quest for reparations from the city and state.</p>



<p>Since 2018, when Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tulsa-mayor-reopens-investigation-into-possible-mass-graves-from-1921-race-massacre/2018/10/02/df713c96-c68f-11e8-b2b5-79270f9cce17_story.html">launched the investigation</a>, Greenwood descendants and community leaders have worked side by side with a multidisciplinary team of scientists and guided the process at each step. “Not only is the whole world watching, our children are watching,” says Kavin Ross, a local historian and descendant of massacre survivors. “Whatever we do, whatever we come up with, they’ll see how we are playing a role in history.”</p>

<p>In June, the team begins the careful process of exhuming remains from the mass grave and analyzing bones and artifacts for clues about the identity of the individuals and how they died.</p>



<h4>A culture of silence</h4>



<p>As the smoke cleared on June 1, 1921, Greenwood’s surviving Black residents were arrested and taken to internment sites. When they were released days later, many found themselves homeless and their neighborhood unrecognizable. No one was prosecuted for crimes committed during the massacre. Months later, Sarah Page told her lawyer she didn’t wish to prosecute. The district attorney dismissed the case against Dick Rowland. Page and Rowland both left town.</p>



<p>Over the next year, Tulsans filed $1.8 million in claims against the city; only one, a white pawn shop owner, received compensation. Some survivors left. Those who stayed rebuilt their homes and business themselves, in spite of the city’s attempts to block those efforts while blaming Greenwood residents for the violence.</p>

The Gurley family claimed over $150,000 in property losses with the city. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099927">Reverend Jacob H. Hooker/Tulsa Historical Society</span></figure>



<p>For a long time, the people of Tulsa, Black and white, didn’t talk much about the massacre. The story was omitted from local historical accounts, and newspapers didn’t write about it until decades later. Black survivors kept quiet out of fear for their safety and because it was painful to recall.</p>



<p>Ross’ great-grandparents Mary and Isaac Evitt owned a popular Greenwood juke joint called the Zulu Lounge, where people would go to listen to music, dance and gamble. It was destroyed during the massacre, and the family’s experience was a touchy subject for his great-aunt Mildred. “She would get angry … refuse to even converse about it,” Ross says.</p>

<p>Tulsans have tried to find answers and search for the dead before. Rumors have persisted for a century that bodies were buried in mass graves around Tulsa, burned in the city’s incinerator and disposed of in the Arkansas River or down mine shafts outside of town. But no records of mass graves had ever been found. Death records from the period are sparse and often incomplete.</p>



<p>In 1997, Ross’ father, state Rep. Don Ross, introduced a joint resolution in the Oklahoma legislature that launched a commission to investigate the massacre. The commission set up a telephone tip line, and Clyde Eddy called in to report what he’d seen.</p>



<p>Growing up, Eddy often cut through Oaklawn Cemetery on his way to his aunt’s house. The then 10-year-old Boy Scout was with his cousin a few days after the massacre when they spotted wooden crates the size of pianos strewn about at the edge of the cemetery. Nearby, men were digging a trench. Curious, the boys went over to investigate. They lifted the top of one crate and saw the dead bodies of three or four people stacked inside. They opened another crate and saw the same. Just as they were about to open a third crate, grave diggers chased them off. The boys lingered for a bit at the iron cemetery fence before walking on.</p>



<p>Returning to Oaklawn in his 80s, Eddy showed investigators where he’d seen the trench as a boy. A Scottie-shaped metal grave marker now stood nearby. A team of scientific consultants enlisted by the commission <a href="https://www.okhistory.org/research/forms/freport.pdf">recommended excavating at Oaklawn</a>.</p>



<p>But the city never broke ground.</p>



<p>At the time, the commission was divided on a slew of issues, including paying reparations to survivors devastated by the massacre and how to proceed respectfully with an excavation. “We got caught up in the politics of the day,” says Scott Ellsworth, a Tulsa-born historian at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who worked on both the 1997 investigation and the new one.</p>



<p>Intent on doing things differently the second time around, the city set up a series of committees to run the investigation launched in 2018: one for historical accounts, one for the physical investigation and one to provide public oversight — made up of community members who call the shots at each step of the process. Ross chairs the third group. “They’re the ones in the driver’s seat,” Odewale says.</p>

<h4>Digging in</h4>



<p>By the spring of 2019, historians began sifting through tips and interviews with more than 300 people. Investigators winnowed down the information from witnesses to the most promising prospects for finding mass graves: Oaklawn Cemetery just east of downtown, Newblock Park and the Canes area just west of downtown along the Arkansas River, and Rolling Oaks Memorial Gardens cemetery south of the city.</p>



<p>But digging didn’t begin right away.</p>



<p>“It’s not just about sticking a shovel in the ground,” says Kary Stackelbeck, the state archaeologist of Oklahoma at the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey in Norman. “You need to have a better way to narrow down your target.” One way to do that is using ground surveying technology that can reveal inconsistencies among natural layers of sediment.</p>



<p>For the surveys, the team used a gradiometer to measure subtle magnetic variations in soil; an electrical resistance meter, which sends electric currents into the ground to detect differences in soil moisture; and ground-penetrating radar, which measures how radar pulses bounce off underground objects, giving clues about their size and depth.</p>



<p>Using all three complementary techniques improves the chances of finding something, says Scott Hammerstedt, another Oklahoma Survey archaeologist. For example, big metal objects can interfere with the gradiometer and power lines mess with the electrical resistance meter scans.</p>



<p>Archaeologists walk or push the machines over the ground like a zigzagging lawnmower. Then they look for anomalies — like waves in the gray radar scans or dark spots on gradiometer scans. “All of these things really pick up contrast between the undisturbed surrounding soil and the archaeological features that we’re looking for,” Hammerstedt says. Then comes the digging, to learn whether that area of contrast is in fact a grave.</p>



<p>At Newblock Park, flagged as a site where people had seen piles of bodies in 1921, ground scans didn’t turn up anything significant. Across the train tracks and downriver from Newblock, the Canes was another area of interest.</p>



<p>A retired Tulsa police officer recalled seeing a photograph of bodies piled in a trench, which he found in the 1970s among boxes of images confiscated from photo studios after the massacre. He recognized the area as the Canes. That concurred with eyewitness accounts of bodies stacked on a river sandbar and buried somewhere in the vicinity. Today, that area hosts an encampment of people who are homeless. Ground-penetrating radar flagged two areas there, each about 2 by 3 meters.</p>





<p>The owners of Rolling Oaks did not grant access to investigators until recently, so it was not in the initial survey.</p>



<p>Finally, the team surveyed Oaklawn Cemetery — where Eddy had seen those piano-sized crates a century ago. Jackson Funeral Home in Greenwood, which served the Black community at the time, had been burned to the ground. But owner Samuel Jackson was released from internment and taken to one of the city’s white funeral homes to care for Black massacre victims whose bodies were being held there. The 1997 investigation had revealed death certificates of those individuals: Eighteen Black men and an infant were buried in unmarked graves somewhere at Oaklawn. In 1921, the <em>Tulsa Daily World</em> had also <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042345/1921-06-03/ed-1/seq-1/#words=JURY%2BTO">reported burials of Black victims</a> at the cemetery. There lie Eddie Lockard and Reuben Everett, the only massacre victims whose graves were marked — likely because they were buried after their families were released from internment sites.</p>



<p>Oaklawn had three survey sites that were possible graves: an area flagged by cemetery caretakers as a place where victims were buried, a spot that matched Eddy’s description in the white section of the potter’s field — a burial ground for people who were poor — and an area in the Black potter’s field near the two marked graves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/11899/hammerstedt-and-regnier-2019-searching-for-graves-from-the-1921-tulsa-race-massacre-oasrs-5.pdf">Scanning had shown</a> a big, 8-by-10-meter area beneath the surface with distinct walls in the section pointed out by the cemetery caretakers. “It really had these hallmarks that suggested it might be a mass grave,” Stackelbeck says.</p>



<h4>Breaking ground</h4>



<p>In July 2020, after a slight delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team began test excavations at Oaklawn. A backhoe removed soil layer by layer, inches at a time, as archaeologists watched carefully for subtle changes in soil color and texture, and for any hint of a burial.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="excavation team members in a trench at Oaklawn" class="wp-image-3099916" height="682" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/061921_tulsa_inline_excavation-trench.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3099916">Members of the investigation’s public oversight committee, including Kavin Ross and Brenda Alford (shown here at left and far right in an excavation trench), served as monitors during the work at Oaklawn. Also shown are archaeologist Leland Bement of the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey (white hat) and forensic anthropologist Carlos Zambrano with the Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (blue hat).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099916">City of Tulsa</span></figure>



<p>Gravedigging involves removing soil to the depth of several feet, then refilling the grave shaft with that soil. “Long before humans were walking around Tulsa, weathering of sedimentary rock exposed to the elements created layers of soil, and when humans come along and dig things up, those layers mix, destroying the original soil characteristics,” says Deb Green, a geoarchaeologist with the Oklahoma Survey. At Oaklawn, deep soil is yellowish brown, with a crumbly texture like silt, When mixed with gray topsoil, it gets darker and starts to feel more like compact clay over time. These qualities appear both in regular graves and mass graves.</p>



<p>During an archaeological excavation, the goal is to stop the backhoe before it hits a burial, so the archaeologists look for other clues that remains might be present. The soil above a coffin with a decaying body is darker and higher in organic carbon than the surrounding area, and sometimes contains pockets of air. Nails and hinges can leach iron that turns dirt red, and decaying wood can leave a coffin outline in the sediment.</p>



<p>As the backhoe dug deeper, wood fragments, glass, pottery shards and artifacts came to the surface. Remnants of overlapping historic roads and a pond emerged from the soil.</p>

<p>The team found a bone. But it turned out to be from a farm animal. Wearily the researchers concluded that the anomaly they’d seen in the scans was likely an old dumping ground for temporary burial markers, offerings and other debris. </p>



<p>“It was definitely deflating because we felt a deep sense of responsibility and there had been so much buildup,” Stackelbeck says. “But this is how science works. You put together your best game plan, but sometimes the data don’t play out that way.”</p>



<h4>The Original 18</h4>



<p>The team then tried to locate the burials that Clyde Eddy saw, with no luck. Finally, the investigators turned their attention to the area of the Black potter’s field and the two marked graves, a site they dubbed the Original 18, for those 18 Black men mentioned in the funeral home records.</p>



<p>Based on newspaper accounts and funeral home records, the team thought the Original 18 had been buried in individual graves, so the group focused on a soil anomaly that looked like a single grave. The backhoe returned and began to scrape away at the soil layers.</p>



<p>On the second day, it hit wood and bone. This time the bone was human. But it still caught the group off guard.</p>



<p>“The first burial didn’t match what we expected to find, because [it] was a woman, and her casket wasn’t plain,” says Phoebe Stubblefield, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who is on the excavation team and whose aunt lost her house in the massacre. The original 18 victims from the death certificates were all male and buried in plain caskets. Bearing a simple metal plate that read “At Rest,” the unidentified woman’s coffin resembled a standard pauper burial of the time. “If your family couldn’t afford a more formal burial, the city paid Oaklawn $5.04 to bury you in a lined casket with eight screws and a plate on top,” Stubblefield says. Whoever she was, this woman was probably not a massacre victim, Stubblefield suspects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Phoebe Stubblefield looks closely at something in her hands while holding a trowel" class="wp-image-3099918" height="682" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/061921_tulsa_inline_phoebe-stubblefield.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3099918">Forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield examines skeletal material from a soil sample at the Original 18 site excavation on October 20, 2020. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099918">City of Tulsa</span></figure>



<p>But soil cores revealed that the disturbed area was bigger than a single grave shaft.</p>



<p>As the archaeologists followed the soil patterns and dug a trench, the outlines of fragile coffins began to emerge, along with human bone fragments, hinges and nails. The coffins are close together in two rows, possibly stacked. Samples of two coffin fragments revealed pine wood construction. </p>



<p>At the end of the burial pit were steps dug into the earth. “They were haunting,” Stackelbeck says. “You don’t need stairs to dig a grave for one person or even two or three people.”</p>



<p>The crew had unearthed a mass grave.</p>



<p>“Here was proof that there was truth buried underneath Tulsa,” says Ross, the local historian. “I felt justified.”</p>



<p>In that trench, the investigators <a href="https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/15149/trmi_oaklawn_excavations_2020_summary_final-2.pdf">found 12 coffins in all</a>, but hinges and decaying wood suggest there are at least three more. “Based on the sheer number of individuals, this certainly meets the definition of a mass grave,” says Soren Blau, a forensic anthropologist at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne, Australia. “This is not how we respectfully bury our dead,” Blau says.</p>



<p>While historical and preservation context varies, mass graves usually consist of a large, unmarked burial pit, sometimes with steps if dug by shovel or ramping to facilitate digging by machine.</p>

<p>On June 1, the excavation and exhumation of the remains will begin. The unidentified woman’s burial gives researchers an idea of what they might find. Large bone fragments and teeth appear to be well-preserved, but smaller bones like vertebrae or thin rib bones likely didn’t survive as well. </p>



<p>Using trauma patterns and gender clues in the bones, Stubblefield, who also worked on the 1997 investigation, will assess whether the individuals in the mass grave are massacre victims. She’ll be looking for bullet wounds and shotgun trauma. If there are actual bullets, her team might be able to determine their caliber. Based on their location in the cemetery, the graves should be from the 1920s, when the only other mass casualty event would have been the 1918 flu pandemic. But there are no records of flu victims being buried in mass graves in Tulsa.</p>



<p>The researchers will also search the coffins for personal effects and textiles that could help reveal facets of the identity and social standing of the dead.</p>

<h4>DNA insights and limits</h4>



<p>Putting names to the deceased will be hard, and could take years. Because the death certificates of the Original 18 had scant details and listed most individuals as having died from gunshot wounds, no document has enough unique information to aid identification efforts. DNA would give the team its best chance at an ID, but after a century, any DNA extracted from teeth or bone may not be intact. Specialized techniques used to study <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">ancient DNA</a> might be needed (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>If DNA is preserved, a clear set of rules will be needed to guide who has access to those sequences and what analyses can be done. “Academia loves genetic sequences,” Stubblefield says. “We don’t want to get the profiles and see 10 years of publications on Greenwood individuals without acknowledgement or communication with the community.” Cautionary tales come to mind, like the use of cells from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-immortal-life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot">Henrietta Lacks</a>, a Black woman diagnosed with cancer in the 1950s, who was not told her cells might be used for research, yet those cells led others to profit, making important vaccines against polio and HPV (<em>SN: 3/27/10</em>). “There’s a frequent issue with the misuse of Black bodies in science,” Stubblefield says.</p>



<p>Finding relatives would require DNA from descendants. Consumer DNA testing companies, which have large databases, would give researchers a better chance of finding distant cousins, but using those comes with concerns about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/privacy-and-consumer-genetic-testing-dont-always-mix">consent and privacy</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/18</em>). Depending on company policies, that data can end up in public databases or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-warrant-search-gedmatch-genetic-data-has-sparked-privacy-concerns">accessed by law enforcement</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/19</em>).</p>



<p>“You don’t want to ask people to participate in the reconciliation or resolution of historical trauma in a way that might put them at risk in new ways,” says Alondra Nelson, a sociologist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. In an ideal world, Greenwood-related DNA would be separated from a company’s larger database or handled through private labs, she says.</p>



<p>The project’s public oversight committee recently brought in a geneticist to talk about how DNA identification might inform the way forward. “It needs to be the community’s decision,” Stubblefield says. “We just want to make sure that privacy interests are addressed.”</p>



<p>The three remaining known survivors of the massacre, all 100 years or older, <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/racemassacre/previously-unknown-tulsa-race-massacre-survivor-added-to-lawsuit-plaintiffs/article_18d59b62-7534-11eb-8d93-e3005b0d859c.html">are suing the city for reparations</a>. DNA results might play a role in future reparations efforts. “Genetics can provide people with inferences and context that allow them to make claims about the past and make claims about what’s owed to them in the present and future,” Nelson says.</p>

<h4>Greenwood rising</h4>



<p>Reckoning with what happened in 1921 means looking at the victims as people, not just death statistics, Odewale says. “We need to talk about how they lived, not just how they died.”</p>



<p>Odewale leads an effort to understand the aftermath of the massacre. The goal of this work, which is happening at the same time as the mass graves project, is to search for signs of structural survival in Greenwood — building foundations, walls, anything that might have withstood the burning — and map how the neighborhood has changed since 1921. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img alt="Scott Hammerstedt looks on while Alicia Odewale pushes a ground survey machine" class="wp-image-3099917" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/061921_tulsa_inline_alicia-odewale-675x450.jpg" width="675" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3099917">Archaeologist Alicia Odewale’s team surveyed areas around Greenwood in fall 2020 using the same ground scanning as in the mass graves investigation.

<p>“We see cycles of both destruction and construction in Greenwood,” she says. “It’s not just a site of Black trauma but also one of resilience.” Geophysical surveys have already turned up promising excavation prospects, and Odewale and her colleagues will break ground this summer.</p>



<p>The mass graves project is about finding lost ancestors, Odewale says, while her project in Greenwood is about understanding the roots of the community. “We need both to move forward,” she says.</p>



<p>Much more work lies ahead to excavate and identify remains and uncover modern complexities associated with Tulsa’s buried past. The researchers hope to excavate more sites and revisit old ones. Tips are still coming in, this time through the city’s website.</p>



<p>“We have been waiting a hundred years for what we’ve found so far,” Ross says. “We hope that we don’t have to wait another hundred years trying to find the truth.”</p>

<h2>Where is the spinothalamic tract?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract is a collection of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations. The pathway starts with sensory neurons that synapse in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a>. Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation" target="_blank">decussate</a>, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a>, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a>. These neurons synapse with neurons in the thalamus, which then carry the information to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>. See below for more details on the pathway of the spinothalamic tract.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the spinothalamic tract and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The spinothalamic tract actually consists of two pathways that are distinct in function: the anterior spinothalamic tract and the lateral spinothalamic tract. </p><h3>Lateral spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. </p><p class="">Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor" target="_blank">nociceptors</a>, which detect painful sensations, or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor" target="_blank">thermoreceptors</a>, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn" target="_blank">dorsal horn of the spinal cord</a> that belong to cell groups like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius" target="_blank">nucleus proprius</a> or <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa" target="_blank">substantia gelatinosa</a>; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.</p><p class="">The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl" target="_blank">ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus</a> in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system" target="_blank">anterolateral system</a>. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.</p><h3>Anterior spinothalamic tract</h3>

<p class="">The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. </p><p class="">These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.</p><h3>Damage to the spinothalamic tract</h3><p class="">A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.</p><h3>References:</h3><p class="">Augustine JR.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-origins-questions-wuhan-lab-leak-nature">Here are answers to 3 persistent questions about the coronavirus’s origins</a></h4>

<p>Controversy is once again swirling around the origins of the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, rekindling calls to pin down just where it came from: nature or a lab.</p>



<p>On May 26, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he had asked the intelligence community “to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/">bring us closer to a definitive conclusion</a>.” He requested a report in 90 days.</p>



<p>Some leading virus experts also have called<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1"> for an open and transparent investigation</a>. “We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,” the researchers wrote May 14 in <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>The lab-leak idea garnered renewed speculation after several news articles questioned whether the pandemic started after a spillover from a lab, a scenario described in a May 23 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> story <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-on-sick-staff-at-wuhan-lab-fuels-debate-on-covid-19-origin-11621796228">alleging that three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill</a> with COVID-19–like symptoms in November 2019. It’s still unknown what illness — out of many possible respiratory diseases — those people had.</p>

<p>A March 30<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-origin-who-report-takeaways"> World Health Organization report</a> had previously concluded that SARS-CoV-2 probably spread to humans from animals rather than from a lab (<em>SN: 4/1/21</em>). But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has emphasized that the hunt is far from over, and that all hypotheses remain on the table.</p>



<p>With few answers, there’s abundant uncertainty and confusion. Here we answer three key questions that keep bubbling up.</p>



<h4>1. Why does the lab-leak hypothesis persist?</h4>



<p>The biggest reason is that we still don’t know where the coronavirus came from. Where there are gaps in knowledge, myriad hypotheses rush in.</p>



<p>At this point, most researchers agree that the virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature">was not engineered in a lab</a> based on findings from genetic studies (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). But one plausible scenario is that someone was accidentally infected in the lab while working with the coronavirus itself and then spread it to others in the community. Lab accidents have happened in the past, including some isolated incidents where people caught the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC416634/">coronavirus that caused the 2003–2004 SARS outbreak</a> while studying it. Those incidents happened after the virus had stopped spreading in communities around the world and the outbreak was largely over.  </p>



<p>More commonly, coronaviruses have made the jump from animal to human multiple times in the past two decades. The SARS virus spread to people from civets infected with a bat coronavirus. The MERS virus continues to spread to people in the Middle East from camels. What’s more, three children in Haiti were<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/two-more-coronaviruses-can-infect-people-studies-suggest"> infected with a pig coronavirus in 2014 and 2015</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study in March. And a recent <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases </em>study reported that<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab456/6278597"> eight people in Malaysia had been infected in 2017 and 2018 with a coronavirus similar to one found in dogs</a>.</p>



<p>These two latest findings are signs that coronaviruses may jump to people more often than previously thought; we just weren’t looking. Researchers also have found coronavirus fragments that are similar to SARS-CoV-2 in bats native to southeast Asia, but no smoking gun yet. </p>

</h4>

<h4>2. What evidence will it take to prove where the virus came from?</h4>



<p>Finding a virus nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2 in a wild animal — whether bats or other animals — would go a long way toward proving that the virus came from nature. But that’s a<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-origins-bats-virus"> difficult pursuit that can take years</a> (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). And we might never find it. Ebola virus probably comes from bats, for instance. Yet while researchers have found fragments of the virus in bats, they’ve never found the complete genetic blueprint of a bat Ebola virus that is a close relative of one that sparked an outbreak in people. This, despite decades of searching. </p>



<p>As for evidence of a lab leak, experts are calling for public health agencies and research labs to make their records public. Those records could help pinpoint whether anyone working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had ever been sick with COVID-19. (The WHO report stated that all workers had tested negative for antibodies, but members of the team did not have access to the raw data.) Lab data would also show whether any viruses being studied in the lab were identical to SARS-CoV-2. (One of the lead scientists at the institute has said <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/">no such virus was found</a> in her records. But WHO team members did not have access to the records.)   </p>





<h4>3. Why do we care, anyway?</h4>



<p>Figuring out where the newest coronavirus came from is a step toward preventing large outbreaks from happening again. That’s true no matter where the virus came from. Whether the outbreak got its start in nature or after a lab accident, the virus still probably came from an animal originally, because labs often retrieve viruses from the wild to study them.</p>



<p>Knowing that the threat exists in animals means researchers could monitor high-risk animals or people to get an early warning. Experts around the globe keep an eye on influenza virus in poultry, for instance. That’s because ducks and chickens can be<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chickens-blame-spread-latest-deadly-bird-flu"> sources of avian flu</a>, which can be deadly to people, most often those who had contact with the birds (<em>SN: 3/11/15</em>). And research institutions will need to continue to closely monitor lab facilities to make sure the environment is as safe as possible for people handling potentially lethal viruses.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Pain is not a purely biological phenomenon: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301163?via%3Dihub">discrimination</a>, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189004382.pdf">anxiety around work</a>, and general <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/74/7/468.short">mental strain</a> have all been shown to contribute to the experience of chronic pain. Many researchers therefore take a biopsychosocial approach, exploring the multifarious factors that impact <em>on</em> and are impacted <em>by </em>pain.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038?saml_referrer">new study</a> in <em>Stress &amp; Health</em> explores the long term consequences of social factors on pain. The team, from the universities of Georgia and South California, Los Angeles, specifically focus on families involved in the 1980s “farm crisis” in the US Midwest, a period where many lost their jobs, land value crashed, and businesses failed — and finds that this financial stress is related to the experience of pain nearly 30 years later.</p>



<span id="more-42323"></span>



<p>Data was taken from a longitudinal study, which took place over 27 years and involved 508 married couples, who were all in early midlife at the start of the study in 1991.</p>



<p>The team tracked a number of measures for the study. A four-item scale measured family financial strain in 1991, 1994 and 2001, and participants also answered items related to financial stress (e.g. “we have enough money to afford the kind of clothing we need”) at the same points. Sense of control was measured ten years apart, in 1991 and 2001, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements such as “sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in life”.</p>



<p>Pain was assessed at two points later on in the study, with participants indicating how much pain they had experienced in the previous month, how severe that pain was, and how much it interfered with life and work. Participants were also presented with a list of nearly 50 physical health conditions and asked to indicate which they had experienced in the last year; these ranged from common colds to cancer.</p>



<p>The team found a correlation between family financial strain and a sense of control at all points — that is, those who experienced financial strain also felt a lack of control over their lives. Financial strain and a feeling of a lack of control at early points of the study were also directly linked to physical pain at later points, indicating that physical pain can be a consequence of stress not just concurrently but many years later. Those with higher family income were less likely to experience physical pain overall.</p>



<p>The <em>trajectories</em> of financial stress over the course of the study were also relevant to the experience of pain. Those who experienced increasing levels of financial strain over the years of the study also experienced a corresponding decline in their sense of control throughout the same period. This was the case even when controlling for other factors, such as age and physical illness, and was also linked to pain at the later points of the study.</p>



<p>It is unclear what is actually driving the link between loss of control and physical pain, however. The team has numerous suggestions: for instance, feeling out of control could lead people to make bad decisions that in turn lead to pain or physical ill health. Chronic stress can also cause long-lasting changes in brain circuits involved in our stress response, so neurological processes could also be involved in producing experiences of pain many years after stress was experienced. Future research could explore these possibilities, as well as other drivers of loss of control.</p>



<p>There are limitations to the findings though. For instance, those with higher family income may have been able to afford better healthcare and make healthier lifestyle choices when it came to diet, exercise, and non-gruelling work practices, which could in turn have made them less likely to experience pain.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the study does suggest that there is a direct link between loss of control and negative physical and emotional factors. Interventions that increase people’s sense of control may not ameliorate those structural or social factors that cannot be changed, like a poor economy or unemployment, but could go some way to mitigating their physical and emotional impacts.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-detection-large-hadron-collider">In a first, neutrinos were caught interacting at the Large Hadron Collider</a></h4>

<p>The Large Hadron Collider’s claim to fame is its ability to unveil elusive subatomic particles. But there’s one class of particle that it had never directly detected, even though it produces them in abundance. Neutrinos, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">minute elementary particles</a>, interact so little with matter that they sail through the particle accelerator’s massive detectors unnoticed (<em>SN: 4/8/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, in a proof-of-concept experiment, <a>the first evidence for </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06197">neutrino interactions at the LHC</a> has been spotted, researchers with the FASER collaboration report May 13 at arXiv.org. The technique could open up a window to neutrinos at energies for which the particles’ interactions are poorly understood.</p>



<p>It’s the first glimpse of neutrinos produced in a particle collider, a type of particle accelerator that smashes beams of particles together. Physicists have detected neutrinos from particle accelerators by smashing a beam of particles into a stationary target, but not in collisions. Looking for neutrinos in particle collisions allows scientists to probe higher energies, but it also makes the neutrinos more difficult to study.</p>



<p>To catch the neutrinos interacting, the researchers used a detector containing films similar to those used in photographic film. When a charged particle passes through a film, it leaves behind a track marking where it’s been. Neutrinos, which have no electric charge, don’t leave tracks in the detector. But when a neutrino interacts with matter inside the detector, it produces a spurt of charged particles that point to a neutrino as their source.</p>





<p>The researchers put their detector in a region that neutrinos pass through as they shoot forward from particle collisions in the LHC’s ATLAS detector. After estimating how many of the detections might be due to other particles that can mimic neutrinos, the researchers report that they caught about six neutrino interactions.</p>



<p>The LHC, located near Geneva, has been shut down for upgrades since 2018. The experiment, performed shortly before the shutdown, served as a test run for a future experiment, called FASERν, which will start up when the LHC restarts in 2022. FASERν is expected to detect around 10,000 neutrinos during the next period of LHC operations, from 2022 to 2024.</p>



<p>With FASERν, researchers will measure neutrinos’ cross sections, a measure of how likely the particles are to interact with material. That’s important for being able to perform other measurements on neutrinos. For example, scientists can learn about the production of energetic neutrinos in exploding stars and other cosmic sources by detecting them on Earth. But to determine how prevalent such neutrinos are, scientist need to know how likely those neutrinos are to interact with detectors.</p>



<p>Cross sections depend on particles’ energies, and at the LHC, “we can study the energy range we haven’t studied,” says particle physicist Tomoko Ariga of Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, a member of the FASER collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s not a surprise to find neutrinos at the LHC. “This isn’t the Earth-shattering result,” says particle physicist Deborah Harris of York University in Toronto and Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., who was not involved with the research.  Instead, it shows that detecting neutrinos at the LHC is possible. “This idea is not totally crazy,” she says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We could all name groups of people who we know to be suffering right now; some in distant countries, some in our own. Research shows that we feel less empathy for people in other countries — and so are less likely to support them by protesting, say, or donating money. Meital Balmas and Eran Halperin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem now report a factor that can influence this, however: our feelings about the national leader. The pair’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989">study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> suggests that a leader who is perceived as “good” and popular at home elicits more empathy, and even greater tangible help, for their struggling citizens.</p>



<span id="more-42281"></span>



<p>Across four experiments, participants read fictitious reports about purported leaders in Belgium.  These articles painted the leaders in either a positive or a negative light, focusing on their trustworthiness and warmth (or lack of it), for example. The participants also read about the suffering of Belgian citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.</p>



<p>Initial studies on Israeli citizens found that when the “prime minister” was described in glowing, rather than negative, terms, participants reported feeling more empathy towards Belgian people, and reported being more willing to help families in distress. A subsequent study found that the perceived popularity of the prime minister was important, however: a PM described as being good and popular boosted empathy, while an unpopular one did not — even if they were described as being good. </p>



<p>The team then ran a version of this last study with 304 American adults. The methods were similar, but instead of reading about a terrorist attack, this time participants read about a Belgian teenager who was struggling to cope with the ravages and cost of treatment of his rickets. Repeating the earlier findings, when the country’s prime minister was presented as being popular, the participants exposed to the positive description reported more empathy for the teen and his family than those who’d read the negative report. They also said that they’d be more likely to sign a petition appealing to the Belgian government to help. And, when asked if they’d donate some of their fee for taking part in the study to the teenager and his family, they were more likely to agree.</p>



<p>What should we make of all these findings? “We know that national leaders provide rationale for opinion-building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens,” the researchers write. And they think this is what explains the results — when we think that a national leader who is a good person is popular, we tend to think that the nation’s people are likely to be good people, too, and we feel more empathy for their distress.</p>



<p>The work should have implications for leaders, the researchers think. “In recent decades, not only have national leaders served as main foci of the media coverage of international affairs but nowadays they have followers from all over the world via Twitter,” they write. This puts a “huge responsibility” on their shoulders, they add. “The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behaviour around the world.”</p>



<p>It is an interesting idea. Would people in other countries have felt as much sympathy for the people of Christchurch in the wake of the 2019 shootings, say, if New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern hadn’t seemed like such a good person — and also a popular prime minister? What if she’d more like — well, who? Insert your own least-liked democratically elected leader in that space…</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that of course the country used in this study  —  Belgium — is an open democracy. It might seem reasonable to infer that people who love and elect a “good” person are more likely to be “good” people, too. Unfortunately, of course, a huge amount of human suffering is happening in countries without a democratically elected leader. How that affects our empathy for those citizens is an important question that’s beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.</p>

<p>There’s a new normal for U.S. weather. On May 4, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced an official change to its reference values for temperature and precipitation. Instead of using the average values from 1981 to 2010, NOAA’s new “climate normals” will be the averages from 1991 to 2020.</p>



<p>This new period is the warmest on record for the country. Compared with the previous 30-year-span, for example, the average temperature across the contiguous United States rose from 11.6° Celsius (52.8° Fahrenheit) to 11.8° C (53.3° F). Some of the largest increases were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-valley-hottest-recorded-temperature-earth">in the South and Southwest</a> — and that same region also showed a dramatic decrease in precipitation (<em>SN: 8/17/20</em>).  </p>

<p>The United States and other members of the <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/new-two-tier-approach-%E2%80%9Cclimate-normals%E2%80%9D">World Meteorological Organization</a> are required to update their climate normals every 10 years. These data put daily weather events in historical context and also help track changes in drought conditions, energy use and freeze risks for farmers.</p>



<p>That moving window of averages for the United States also tells a stark story about the accelerating pace of climate change. When each 30-year period is compared with the average temperatures from 1901 to 2000, no part of the country is cooler now than it was during the 20th century. And temperatures in large swaths of the country, from the American West to the Northeast, are 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher.</p>

<h3>Rising temps </h3>



<p>The average temperatures for 30-year “normal” periods for the contiguous United States show the country getting hotter since 1901. Here, each 30-year period is compared with the average temperature for the entire 20th century. From 1991 to 2020, average temperatures across most of the country were at least 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) higher than the 20th century average.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-training-games-brainpower-cognition">Playing brain training games regularly doesn’t boost brainpower</a></h4>

<p>It’s an attractive idea: By playing online problem-solving, matching and other games for a few minutes a day, people can improve such mental abilities as reasoning, verbal skills and memory. But whether these games deliver on those promises is up for debate.</p>



<p>“For every study that finds <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-training-turns-recall-rookies-memory-masters">some evidence</a>, there’s an equal number of papers that find <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-training-technique-gets-critique">no evidence</a>,” says Bobby Stojanoski, a cognitive neuroscientist at Western University in Ontario (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>; <em>SN: 5/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>Now, in perhaps the biggest real-world test of these programs, Stojanoski and colleagues pitted more than 1,000 people who regularly use brain trainers against around 7,500 people who don’t do the mini brain workouts. There was <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000773">little difference between how both groups performed on a series of tests of their thinking abilities</a>, suggesting that brain training doesn’t live up to its name, the scientists report in the April <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>.</p>



<p>“They put brain training to the test,” says Elizabeth Stine-Morrow, a cognitive aging scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While the study doesn’t show <em>why</em> brain trainers aren’t seeing benefits, it does show there is no link “between the amount of time spent with the brain training programs and cognition,” Stine-Morrow says. “That was pretty cool.”</p>





<p>The researchers recruited 8,563 volunteers globally through Cambridge Brain Sciences, a Toronto-based company that provides assessments to measure healthy brain function. (While several of the researchers are affiliated with the company, it didn’t receive funding for the study.) Participants filled out an online questionnaire about their training habits, opinions about training benefits and which, if any, program they used. Some 1,009 participants reported using brain training programs for about eight months, on average, though durations ranged from two weeks to more than five years.</p>



<p>Next, the volunteers completed 12 cognitive tests assessing memory, reasoning and verbal skills. They faced Simon-like memory exercises, such spatial reasoning tasks as mentally rotating objects, pattern-finding puzzles and strategy challenges. </p>



<p>When researchers looked at the results, they saw that brain trainers on average had no mental edge over the other group in memory, verbal skills and reasoning. Even among the most dedicated, who had used training programs for at least 18 months, brain training didn’t boost thinking abilities above the level of people who didn’t use the programs.</p>



<p>That’s not because brain trainers have poorer function to start with and then improved. Participants who had trained for less than a month, and presumably wouldn’t have reaped significant benefits from the programs yet, performed on par with people who didn’t train at all.</p>



<p>“No matter how we sliced the data, we were unable to find any evidence that brain training was associated with cognitive abilities,” says Stojanoski. That held true whether the team analyzed participants by age, program used, education or socioeconomic status – all were cognitively similar to the group who didn’t use the programs.</p>



<p>Brain training may be beneficial in specific scenarios, Stojanoski says. But “part of our goal was to look at brain training in the real world.”  </p>



<p>That real world may be the best brain trainer, Stine-Morrow says. While it’s possible to improve mental abilities, Stine-Morrow advocates practicing those skills in different real-life situations. “That’s a much better use of one’s time than sitting at a computer and doing little tasks.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In the past few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have conducted a large number of studies into the effects of psychedelic drugs. Some have sought to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/16/neural-changes-after-taking-psychedelic-drugs-may-reflect-heightened-consciousness/">better</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/10/psilocybin-alters-brain-levels-of-the-neurotransmitter-glutamate-and-this-could-explain-why-users-experience-ego-dissolution/">understand</a> the effects of the drugs in the brain, while others are investigating the potential for substances like psilocybin and LSD <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9">to treat depression</a> and other mental health conditions.</p>



<p>This work obviously require tactful communication on the part of researchers: after all, they don’t want to alienate a public who may be at best ambivalent about the use of currently illegal drugs in research or mental health settings. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728">recent paper</a> in <em>Public Understanding of Science </em>highlights one thing researchers <em>shouldn’t</em> do: admit to using psychedelic substances themselves. The team finds that researchers who make such a disclosure may be seen by the public as having less integrity.</p>



<span id="more-42252"></span>



<p>In the first study, Matthias Forstmann at the University of Zurich and Christina Sagioglou at the University of Innsbruck asked 185 participants to read a vignette about a (fictitious) scientist who studies the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, and who has found some promising results regarding the use of psilocybin. Half read that the professor has “extensive personal experience” with the drugs himself, while the others read that he has no such experience.</p>



<p>All participants then assessed the professor’s scientific integrity, by rating how well he was described by six adjectives such as “professional” and “credible”. They also evaluated the quality of his research, rating it on adjectives like “valid” and “meaningful”.</p>



<p>Participants who had read that the researcher took the drugs himself rated his integrity significantly lower than those who had read he didn’t use them (this was true regardless of whether the participants themselves had experience taking psychedelics). However, this information didn’t influence people’s judgements about the quality of his research.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first, with a greater number of participants and more elaborate descriptions of the professor (for instance, participants saw a mock-up of a paper he had supposedly written). Participants were also asked about the <em>value</em> of the findings: whether healthcare providers should cover the costs of using psilocybin, for example. Again, those who read that the professor took psychedelics rated his integrity lower, but the two groups didn’t show any difference in their ratings of the quality or value of the work.</p>



<p>There are a few possible explanations for these results, the team notes. A researcher who studies psychedelics but also uses them might be seen as having a hidden agenda, for instance. Or perhaps it is the illegal nature of his drug use that makes it seem as though the researcher has less integrity. Further work will be needed to tease out these possibilities.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that the difference in integrity ratings wasn’t huge: in the first study, the non-drug-using professor received an average rating of 5.6 on a seven-point scale, compared to a rating of 5 for the researcher who took drugs. Still, the message of the study seems to be that researchers should consider keeping quiet about any drug use in their personal lives — or at least be aware that what they disclose can influence public perceptions.</p>



<p>And it’s not just what researchers themselves say that’s important, but also the context in which the research is presented. In a final study, participants read about a fictitious scientific conference on psychedelic drugs. All were given the same description of the scientific programme, but some read that various social events were happening which had associations with psychedelic culture (e.g. a shamanic drum circle and a psychedelic art exhibition), while the others read about social events which didn’t have these associations (e.g. a tour of a brewery and a postmodern art exhibition).</p>



<p>In this case, the association with psychedelic culture did lower participants’ perceptions of the quality of the research (though, interestingly, only among participants who hadn’t used psychedelic drugs themselves). “In order to positively impact the public’s perception of the quality of psychedelic research, it may be sensible to use less stereotypical imagery and language when talking about these substances, be it in media articles or scientific conferences,” the team concludes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/RKT0Al9FVu8/">Open for submissions (Part 2 – equitable OA models)</a></h4>

<p>Our five new journals are now <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Open for Submissions</a>! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. </p>



<p>If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Flat Fee </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">greements</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing</a>. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) </p>



<p>We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. </p>



<h3><strong>Institutional models for the five new journals</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Digital Health</a></em></strong> joins the group of journals covered by <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Flat Fee agreements</a> (covering <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>)</li><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</a></em></strong> has its own <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing</a> setup, similar to <em>PLOS Biology </em>and <em>PLOS Medicine, </em>to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.</li><li><strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Climate</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Water</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Global Public Health</a></em></strong> offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Global Equity </strong></h4>



<p>Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:</p>



<ul><li>an <strong>institution’s </strong>research output in the relevant <strong>subject area</strong>,<strong> </strong>helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and </li><li>the relevant <strong>country’s </strong>World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). </li></ul>



<p>The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. </p>



<p><strong>Authors at institutions in </strong><a href="https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Research4Life</strong></a><strong> (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.</strong></p>



<p>The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in <em>PLOS Climate </em>would pay <strong>$350</strong> per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.</p>

<div class="mobile-wrap wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062897664"><img alt="cover of &quot;My Remarkable Journey&quot;" class="wp-image-3099843" height="263" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_reviews_book-cover-254x383.jpg" width="175" /></a></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062897664">My Remarkable Journey</a><br /><em>Katherine Johnson with Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore</em><br /><em>Amistad, $25.99</em></p>



<p>Katherine Johnson became a household name circa 2016, when the bestselling book and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hidden-figures-highlights-three-black-women-who-were-vital-us-space-program">Hollywood film <em>Hidden Figures</em></a> highlighted her role as a NASA mathematician during the space race (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 28</em>). Those works showcased Johnson’s ability to perform high-stakes calculations to send astronauts to space, all while she endured racism and sexism from her colleagues. But crunching numbers for NASA is only part of Johnson’s story. Her <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-icon-katherine-johnson-has-died-age-101-hidden-figures">posthumous</a> memoir, <em>My Remarkable Journey</em>, tells the rest (<em>SN: 2/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Cowritten with two of her three daughters, Johnson’s memoir spends surprisingly little time explaining her work at NASA. Instead, the book focuses on Johnson’s personal life, including many experiences that reveal insight into the United States’ tumultuous race relations in the 20th century.</p>





<p>Her account begins with her childhood in small-town West Virginia. Even then, Johnson’s thirst for knowledge was palpable: She snuck out to follow her older siblings to school, peppered her parents and teachers with questions, and counted everything in sight. While in college at West Virginia State University, Johnson decided she wanted to become a mathematician.</p>



<p>Readers quickly see the profound obstacles that faced educated Black people like Johnson. When she graduated in 1937 at age 18 with the highest GPA in her university’s history, Johnson had few employment opportunities. Her only job offer was a teaching gig at an all-Black elementary school.</p>



<p>Johnson uses her own educational and work experiences as windows into broader issues. She frequently pivots from her story to describe her teachers’ race-based struggles and the history of the Black schools she attended or served. These asides slow the narrative but reveal something deeper: Johnson’s immense pride in Black educational institutions and her gratitude to the Black educators who were her role models.</p>



<p>Later chapters continue zooming out from Johnson’s own experiences to historic events. She describes her concerns about allowing her daughters to participate in school integration. “Once I’d seen what those Negro teenagers experienced in Little Rock, I couldn’t unsee it,” she writes of the white mob violence faced by Black students integrating into a white school in Arkansas. She also advised her daughters not to participate in civil rights protests because she was afraid of them getting hurt or arrested. (They protested anyway.)</p>



<p>At times, however, Johnson’s historical asides seem purely expositional. Readers may wish that the memoir directly offered Johnson’s unique perspective on some issues. For instance, she describes a protest led by Rev. Ralph Abernathy — Martin Luther King Jr.’s successor as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference — in objection to the taxpayer dollars spent on the space race rather than poverty relief. But Johnson doesn’t share her own reactions to this event.</p>



<p>It’s also clear that Johnson isn’t comfortable bragging about herself. She touts the careers of other accomplished Black scientists and astronauts, but of her own work, she writes, “I was just doing [my] job.” That might seem like false modesty, but it rings true coming from a woman who didn’t invite her own daughters to her retirement luncheon at NASA because, as she writes in the book, she “didn’t want to make a big fuss.”</p>



<p>Perhaps more striking than Johnson’s unwavering humility is how she faced segregation and discrimination with her head held high. When she moved to the South for her first job, her mother warned her about the racism she would face: “Remember, you’re going to Virginia.” But Johnson just said, “Well, tell them I’m coming!” And when a white friend told Johnson that his pastor forbade Black guests at his wedding, “I just shrugged it off,” she writes. “I was not going to allow his pastor’s backward views to change my opinion of the lovely couple.”</p>



<p>These examples of relentless determination in the face of adversity linger with the reader, showing what truly makes Johnson’s journey remarkable. Yes, her mathematical genius was inspiring. Equally inspiring was her grit.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-tattoo-tools-tennessee-native-american">The oldest known tattoo tools were found at an ancient Tennessee site</a></h4>

<p>Ancient tattooing tools are tough to find or even recognize as implements for creating skin designs. But new microscopic studies of two turkey leg bones with sharpened ends indicate that Native Americans used these items to make tattoos between around 5,520 and 3,620 years ago.</p>



<p>These pigment-stained bones are the world’s oldest known tattooing tools, say archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology in Nashville and his colleagues. The find suggests that Native American tattoo traditions in eastern North America extend back <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-tattoo-tool-western-north-america">more than a millennium earlier than previously thought</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/19</em>). Ötzi the Iceman, who lived around 5,250 years ago in Europe, displays <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iceman-has-worlds-oldest-tattoos">the oldest known tattoos</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/16</em>), but researchers haven’t found any of the tools used to make the Iceman’s tattoos.</p>



<p>Excavations in 1985 revealed these turkey bones and other elements of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X21002145?via%3Dihub">a probable tattoo kit</a> in a man’s burial pit at Tennessee’s Fernvale site, the researchers report in the June <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>. Damage on and near the tips of the two turkey leg bones resembles distinctive wear <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X21002145?via%3Dihub">previously observed on experimental tattooing tools</a> made from deer bones, Deter-Wolf’s team says. In that research, tattooed lines in fresh slabs of pig skin were produced by a series of punctures with tools that had tips coated in a homemade ink. Experimental tattooing left ink remnants several millimeters from tools’ tips, a pattern also seen with red and black pigment residues on the Fernvale tools.</p>



<p>Two turkey wing bones found in the same Fernvale grave display microscopic wear and pigment residues that likely resulted from applying pigment during tattooing, the scientists say. Pigment-stained seashells in the grave may have held solutions into which tattooers dipped those tools.</p>

<p>Gray wolves help keep North America’s deer populations in check, and by doing so, may provide an added benefit for people: curbing deer-vehicle collisions. In Wisconsin counties where wolf populations returned, the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023251118">number of such collisions dropped</a> in each area by 24 percent on average, scientists report online May 24 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Economist Jennifer Raynor and colleagues analyzed data on wolf populations, deer populations and deer-vehicle collisions for 63 counties in Wisconsin from 1988 to 2010. In the 29 counties that had wolves, the predators thinning deer populations contributed about a 6 percent reduction in deer-vehicle collisions. The rest of the decrease, the team proposes, was due to the wolves’ presence near roads, which they use as travel corridors, creating a so-called “landscape of fear” that keeps deer away. That suggests that recreational hunters wouldn’t replicate wolves’ impact by simply culling the same number of deer, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The average drop of 38 deer-vehicle collisions per year in counties with wolves translates to an estimated $10.9 million in savings each year across the state, the team found. For comparison, the state paid about $3 million over the last 35 years to compensate for wolf damages. There may be other economic benefits not measured by the study such as reductions in damage to agriculture by deer and in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-lyme-and-other-tickborne-diseases-rising">Lyme disease frequency</a>, says Raynor of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn (<em>SN: 11/15/18</em>).</p>



<p>“The most interesting thing to me about choosing Wisconsin as a case study is that this is a human-dominated landscape,” Raynor says. Similar analyses could guide management decisions where potential wolf habitats overlap with heavily populated areas, such as in the northeastern United States, she and colleagues propose.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The world is not exactly short of videos of cute cats up to strange antics. But one particular set of videos collected by cat owners during a COVID-19 lockdown reveals something genuinely interesting: a famous optical illusion that fools us also gets cats. The citizen science project, in which cats were experimented on in their own homes, shows that they, too, are tricked by “Kanizsa squares”, an illusion that suggests the presence of a square that doesn’t in fact exist.</p>



<span id="more-42227"></span>



<p>It’s well known that cats love to sit in enclosed spaces, like boxes. They even like to sit in square shapes made of tape, as documented during a 2017 Twitter craze (#CatSquare). So in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor">new study</a>, published in <em>Applied Animal Behaviour Science</em>, Gabriella E. Smith at City University of New York and colleagues took this further, to see if cats also show a preference for illusory squares.</p>



<p>Of the 500 pet cats and owners who signed up to take part, 30 completed all the trials. The owners “were not aware of the study’s investigative purpose at any point before or during the experiment”, the authors write. (Well, they weren’t told what it was about, at least.)</p>



<p>Every day for six days, each owner put their cat out of the room while they taped a pair of stimuli to the floor. The researchers instructed them each day on which two of three stimuli to use: an actual square, a Kanizsa square (in which four Pacman-type cut-outs are arranged to suggest the lines of a square) and the Kanizsa control (in which the Pacman-type cut-outs face the other way.)</p>

<p>The owner then put on sunglasses (so their cat couldn’t use their gaze as a cue to what to do), brought the cat into the room, and started videoing. If, within five minutes, their pet sat or stood within either of the shapes, the trial ended. Either way, after five minutes, they submitted the result.</p>



<p>Of those 30 cats who completed all the trials, nine cats chose to inside a stimulus at least once — and, in total between them, 16 times. On eight of these occasions, a cat sat inside an actual square. On seven, it sat inside a Kanizsa square. In contrast, the Kanizsa control was chosen only once. This suggests that cats treat the Kanizsa squares just like real ones. Like us (and dogs, chimps, and many other animals, in fact) they show “susceptibility to illusory contours.”</p>



<p>Recruiting pet owners to do experiments themselves clearly has some downsides. Very few of those who signed up actually completed the full study. Also, light levels might have varied quite a bit across the various homes, and this could have influenced the cats’ decisions, the team notes. However, there are also good reasons to study cats in their own homes, rather than a lab. As they’re more relaxed at home, their behaviour is likely to be more natural.</p>



<p>The study provides further evidence that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/09/heres-the-first-evidence-that-even-lizards-succumb-to-optical-illusions/">animals experience all kinds of illusions</a>. But it also gives further insight into cat cognition, which has received little attention compared to that of dogs. Quite why not isn’t clear. However, given the useful, if limited, data from this new study, the researchers write: “the use of citizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could greatly help bridge this divide.” </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There is ample evidence that inequality exists — in the UK alone, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/jan/03/richest-1-have-almost-a-quarter-of-uk-wealth-study-claims">one study</a> suggested, the richest 1% have a quarter of the country’s wealth, and <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-statistics">marginalised groups experience inequality</a> in relation to work, education, living standards, healthcare <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/assets/documents/research/gender-inequality-and-power-commission/Confronting-Gender-Inequality-blue.pdf">and more</a>.</p>



<p>However, not everyone is attentive to inequality. While some are keenly focused on its causes and its solutions, others believe it’s simply not important, or at the very least that it’s exaggerated. So what determines whether we pay attention to inequality?</p>



<p>A new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118">published</a> in <em>PNAS</em>, argues that our ideological stance on equality may be key. Unsurprisingly, the team finds that social egalitarians were more likely to notice signs of inequality — but only when it affected certain groups.</p>



<span id="more-42180"></span>



<p>In the first study, 2,204 participants were shown a series of photographs depicting urban scenes, half of which contained indications of inequality such as wealthy women receiving pedicures or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/">luxury cars</a>. Participants were then asked what they had noticed in the images, with no mention of inequality in the prompt. Finally, they completed a survey that measured their levels of social egalitarianism — that is, how much they prioritise social equality — indicating how much they agreed with statements like “Some groups of people must be kept in their place”. </p>



<p>Those with low levels of social egalitarianism were significantly less likely to specifically mention inequality or to mention the inequality-related indicators. Social egalitarians, on the other hand, were more likely to mention inequality.</p>



<p>As it was not clear whether those with low levels of social egalitarianism were noticing but failing to mention inequality or simply not seeing it at all, the second study focused on the detection of inequality. Participants viewed a series of pairs of images, one depicting a group of men and the other a group of women, each accompanied by a set of money bags. In equal trials, men and women had the same number of money bags, while in unequal trials the men were shown with more. Participants had to indicate whether the images depicted equal or unequal distribution of resources. Those high in social egalitarianism were more accurate at the task than those with low levels, suggesting that anti-egalitarians are less likely to notice inequality as well as less likely to mention it.</p>



<p>Each study so far had explored attention to inequality experienced by particularly marginalised groups such as women. So, in the next study, the team looked at whether social egalitarians were also better at noticing inequality against socially <em>advantaged</em> groups, too. Participants watched a video of a discussion panel, made up of two men and two women. In one condition, the men spoke one and a half times longer than the women, and in the other the women spoke one and a half times longer than the men. Participants were then asked whether men or women had spent more time speaking.</p>



<p>Social egalitarians were more likely to accurately notice when men spoke more than women; but when women spoke more than men, there was no significant difference between egalitarian and anti-egalitarian participants.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants were privy to a hiring process in which the employer was either biased against minorities or against white applicants. And as in the previous studies, social egalitarians were significantly more likely to notice bias against racial minorities, but less likely to notice bias against white candidates. Anti-egalitarians, however, were more likely to notice the anti-white bias.</p>



<p>So, the results suggest, social egalitarians are more attentive to social inequality against marginalised groups, and less likely to notice disadvantages against less marginalised groups like men or white people. (Another study conducted earlier this year similarly found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/04/advocates-of-equality-for-all-are-more-likely-to-show-prejudice-against-older-adults-at-work/">egalitarians were more likely to show prejudice against older people at work</a>, particularly older white men).</p>



<p>However, it’s worth remembering that inequalities against marginalised groups are structural and wide-ranging, significantly affecting millions of people on an everyday basis. For more advantaged groups, like white men, disadvantages are on a smaller scale — speaking less than women on a panel, to use an example from the study, is hardly a serious social inequality. In this respect, it makes sense that those concerned with social inequality focus their attention on those groups who are most affected by it.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that there aren’t areas in which men in particular are disadvantaged — male <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/01/male-suicide-rate-england-wales-covid-19">suicide rates,</a> for example, are extremely concerning. Further research could benefit from comparing more serious examples like this, where social egalitarians may be more attentive, rather than with small-scale issues like panel discussions.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/©-BillionPhotos.com_-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We are all aware of the effect COVID-19 has had on our day-to-day lives, but how about COVID’s effects on academia? The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our <a href="https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/">living evidence database</a>, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our research</a>, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.</p>
<p>The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.</p>
<p>To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Proportions of epidemiological study designs<br />
</strong>Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.</p>
<p>Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.</p>
<p>Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.</p>
<p>Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).</p>
<p><strong>Time-study type trends<br />
</strong>Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.</p>
<p><strong>What does it all mean?<br />
</strong>Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.</p>
<p>The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2">promising approach for the triage of publication</a> types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6">prevent research waste</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper "Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Three people are walking down the street, two women and one man. One of the women trips and falls. Which of the two observers will feel more empathy for her pain? Hundreds of studies suggest that it’ll be the woman. However, these results almost overwhelmingly come from self-reports. Objective evidence that women genuinely feel more empathy than men is very thin on the ground. This has led to the idea that women report more empathy not because they actually feel it but to conform to societal expectations that they should. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x">a new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> claims to provide evidence that, even when they think no one else is looking or asking, girls show more empathy than boys.</p>



<span id="more-42159"></span>



<p>Joyce F Benenson at the University of Quebec and colleagues set up pairs of 5- to 7-year-old children, so that one member of the pair would suffer a misfortune, and the other would witness it. The members of each of the 32 female pairs and 23 male pairs knew each other, but weren’t considered by their teachers to be best friends or enemies. (The researchers sex-matched the pairs because earlier studies have suggested that we feel more empathy for people of the same sex — so any sex difference in empathy should be easier to spot.)</p>



<p>Each pair was taken to a room in their own school. It was empty but for two baskets of plastic building blocks by the entrance, and a table at the far end. The children were asked if they’d be willing to take the blocks to the table and build a tower. (The somewhat elaborate full story involved alien children who needed to contact their parents; the children all seemed to want to take part, the researchers report.) Before leaving the room, the experimenter did warn them that one basket was a little broken, so if a child found that their blocks fell, they should just pick up them up with their hands and carry them over to the table. </p>



<p>Hidden cameras then recorded what happened when the researchers remote-operated one of the baskets to split, causing that child’s bricks to tumble out. The team focused on the other child’s reactions, and rated them according to four “empathy indicators”: looking at the victim for more than three seconds; ceasing their own activity for longer than a second; ceasing their activity until the other child had placed a block on the tower; and actively intervening by picking up the basket or blocks.</p>



<p>Eight of the girls, and none of the boys, engaged in all four behaviours (though seven girls and five boys did not engage in any at all). Overall, significantly more girls than boys looked at the victim for more than three seconds and gave them chance to recover before placing their own block. The female bystanders “exhibited more empathic behaviour than male bystanders”, the team concluded, adding: “It is highly likely that females do experience greater feelings of empathy which motivate them to behave in ways that display more concern for victims.”</p>



<p>It is possible. It could be that, as the researchers argue, they have found behavioural indicators of sex differences in empathy. But there are other potential explanations. It might be that girls are more patient than boys, or more agreeable (there is research finding that girls and women tend to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Overlapping-distributions-of-Agreeableness-for-men-and-women-Vertical-axis-indicates_fig10_51594567">score higher on this personality trait</a> than males), or that the boys were more competitive and prioritised getting on with building over acting on whatever empathy they felt for their partner. In fact, the majority of boys did pause whatever they were doing following the accident. Most didn’t show other “empathic activities”, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they weren’t feeling the same empathy for their unlucky partners as the girls. Perhaps girls really do feel more empathy, but it’s not possible to conclude that from this study.       </p>

<img alt="Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'" class="wp-image-12397 alignright" height="266" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg" width="246" />
<p style="text-align: left;">In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in <em>BMC Psychology</em>) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.</p>
<p>Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.</p>
<p>The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.</p>
<p>As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12396" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12396 size-medium" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em>, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12398" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital." class="size-medium wp-image-12398" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The results of their qualitative study have now been published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em> revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12399" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background ." class="size-medium wp-image-12399" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><span style="font-size: 16px;">© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock</span></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in <em>BMC Research Notes</em>. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.</p>
<p>By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.</p>
<p>These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a study published in <em>BMC Pediatrics</em> Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Are our personalities set in stone, or can we choose to change them? </strong>In this bonus episode, Matthew Warren talks to former <em>Research Digest</em> editor <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a> about his new book <em>Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change</em>. Christian discusses the evidence-based methods you can use to alter your personality, whether you’re an introvert who wants to become the life of the party, or you simply wish you were a little more open to new experiences. He also explains how our personalities evolve over the course of our lifespans, even when we’re not consciously trying to change them, and ponders how they might be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p><em>Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change</em> is out on May 18th in the United States and May 20th in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Smell is often considered to be a particularly evocative sense: if you haven’t yourself been transported back in time by a nostalgic scent then you’ll almost certainly be familiar with the phenomenon via reference to the famous <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/">Proustian rush.</a> Scent is also increasingly being used in marketing, with some <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022243718820585">evidence</a> suggesting that smell can influence consumers’ judgements and decisions.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1231">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal for Consumer Psychology</em>, takes a closer look at how smell interacts with other senses to influence our perceptions. The team, led by the University of South Florida’s Dipayan Biswas, finds that looking at food before smelling it may enhance our enjoyment of what we eat. </p>



<span id="more-42093"></span>



<p>In the first study, 198 students were split into four conditions. In all conditions, five pieces of a red strawberry-flavoured fruit snack were placed in front of participants inside an opaque envelope. In the first condition, participants smelled the snack first before looking inside the envelope; in the second, participants looked at the snack before smelling it; and in the final two conditions, participants were instructed to either only smell or only look at the snack.</p>



<p>All participants then rated the expected taste of the snack, as well as describing its smell and colour. They were then allowed to eat the fruit snack, and rated their perception of the actual taste and how much they liked it. Finally, they stated whether or not they would recommend it to a friend and were asked whether they either wanted an entry into a prize draw for a gift card or a pouch of the snack they had just sampled.</p>



<p>Expected taste was more favourable in the condition where participants saw the food before they smelled it; those in this condition also evaluated the snack more favourably <em>after</em> tasting. These participants were also more likely to recommend the snack to a friend, and more likely to accept the full sized pouch at the end of a survey than to enter the prize draw. Together, this suggests that seeing the food before smelling it had a favourable impact on enjoyment. A second study, which replicated the first but with a fizzy drink, and a third which did the same with a cookie, produced similar results.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants either received lemonade that was coloured purple, so that its look was incongruent with its lemony smell, or that retained its clear “natural” colour. When the scent was consistent with the look of the beverage, those who saw the drink before they smelled it again reported that it tasted better than those who smelled it before they saw it. However, when the visual cue was incongruent with the smell, taste was rated in a similar way in both conditions.</p>



<p>The team suggests when people see and then smell a food or drink, it’s easier to process the smell, leading to increased taste perception. But when the visual cues are incongruent with the smell, seeing first and then smelling can actually make it harder to process the smell, as the smell seems inconsistent with the colour. This could be a sign that food and drink manufacturers should stay away from artificial colouring that doesn’t match expected taste or smell.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that having a good look at your food before you smell it could lead to increased enjoyment. Unless you’re willing to put a peg on your nose while you cook, however, this might be difficult to enact when you’re making your own dinner. But for premade food purchased in supermarkets, bakeries or elsewhere, clever packaging could enhance enjoyment.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><blockquote><p>Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials">Faster Together</a>. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x">our manuscript</a>, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials">course</a> consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.</p>
<p>Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.</p>

<p><strong>A neural implant has allowed a paralysed individual to type by imagining writing letters</strong>. The implant of 200 electrodes in the premotor cortex picks up on the person’s intentions to perform the movements associated with writing a given letter, translating these into a character on a screen. The individual was able to type 90 characters per minute with minimal errors, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/neural-implant-lets-paralyzed-person-type-by-imagining-writing/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Robin Dunbar famously estimated that humans are limited to having around 150 friends, due to cognitive restrictions imposed by the size of our brains.</strong> Now a new study challenges the accuracy of Dunbar’s number, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/science/dunbars-number-debunked.html">as Jenny Gross reports</a> at <em>The New York Times</em> (though Dunbar in turn disputes the findings).</p>

<p><strong>Poor sleep can make us less able to focus on a task at hand and ignore distractions</strong>. That’s according to a study comparing the performance on an attention test of 23 people with insomnia and 23 good sleepers. The results might not sound very surprising, but <a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-linked-to-inability-to-focus-new-study-160399">as researchers David James Robertson and Christopher B Miller point out</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>, it hammers home how important sleep is for tasks like driving, where distractions can be deadly.</p>

<p><strong>An analysis of bacteria in the teeth of Neanderthals and ancient <em>Homo sapiens</em> has found that both groups ate lots of starchy foods.</strong> This in turn suggests that their common ancestor was already eating these kinds of foods more than 600,000 years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/neanderthals-carb-loaded-helping-grow-their-big-brains">reports Ann Gibbons</a> at <em>Science</em>. This was a time when hominin brains became a lot bigger, so the researchers think that the starch gave ancient humans the energy needed to fuel this growth.</p>

<p><strong>Moral panics about technology are common — but they rarely consider how those technologies evolve.</strong> After all, movies and video games from the 1970s are very different from their modern day counterparts.

Broadly, no, <a href="https://unherd.com/thepost/the-digital-world-wont-harm-you/">reports Tom Chivers</a> at <em>Unherd.</em></p>

<p>To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point <em>t</em>, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time <em>t</em> is required. Our algorithm <em>Cascade</em> (<a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>; CC-BY-NC 4.0):</p>

<p>However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.</p>



<p><a href="http://ringachlab.net/">Dario Ringach</a> recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point <em>t</em> to perform reliable spike inference?</p>



<p>Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.</p>

<p>The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).</p>



<p>But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).</p>



<p>It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after <em>t</em> are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6812" data-attachment-id="6812" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-1-3" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png" data-orig-size="2022,665" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">Fig. S1 of the preprint</a>) are indeed faster than for other datasets.</p>



<p>Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after <em>t</em> before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005">calcium buffering</a> and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.</p>



<p>The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py">Cascade’s Github repository</a>. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>



<ol><li> Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time<em> t</em> are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.<br /></li><li>To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.</li></ol>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/05/13/linking-to-datasets-on-arxiv/">Linking to Datasets on arXiv</a></h4>

<p>We’re excited to announce our collaboration with <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers With Code</a> to support links to datasets on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>!</p>
<p>Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_979" style="width: 400px;"><img alt="screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages" class="wp-image-979 size-full" height="539" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png" width="400" />From the “Code &amp; Data” tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.</figure>
<p>Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to <a href="https://arxiv.org/login">arxiv.org/user</a> and clicking on the “Link to code &amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article’s abstract page.</p>
<p>This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.</p>
<p>All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>After an incredibly stressful day of work, which are you more likely to do: walk several miles home, or get on a bus straight to your door? While the first option certainly comes with increased health benefits — including, potentially, decreased stress — many of us would choose the second anyway.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-72489-001">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</em>, seeks to understand why, even when we know how positive exercise can be, we often fail to be active after work. It could come down to how high-pressure your job is, according to Sascha Abdel Hadi from Justus-Liebig-University Giessen and team — and how much control you have over your work.</p>



<span id="more-42073"></span>



<p>In the first study, 100 participants took part in a workplace simulation. Adopting the role of a call centre worker, participants answered emails from customers, solved maths problems related to product pricing and promotions, and answered a live customer call.</p>



<p>In the low demand condition, emails and phone calls were from friendly customers, while in the high demand condition, customers were disgruntled; maths problems also ranged in difficulty based on condition. High demand participants were also explicitly instructed to “<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/cost-smile">serve with a smile</a>”, while the low demand condition only required “acting authentically”.</p>



<p>Following these tasks, participants were invited to ride (up to a maximum of fifteen minutes) on a static bike in the break room, for as long as they wanted, after which they could read magazines in a seated position. As expected, those in the high demand condition spent significantly less time on the bike than those in the low demand condition.</p>



<p>A second study, conducted with 144 participants, sought to expand on these findings — only this time, there was an additional focus on the control people had over the choices they made during the job. In addition to the high and low demand conditions  from the first study, participants were assigned to a high or low control condition. Participants in the high control condition could select which emails they responded to and in which order, which arithmetic problems they wanted to solve, and which customer requests they picked up via call. Low control participants could do none of these things.</p>



<p>Again, participants with a more demanding job spent less time on the bike. And while there was no direct relationship between levels of control and time spent on the bike, there was an indirect effect of job control on cycling time through its impact on participant’s feelings of self-determination — their beliefs that they are autonomous and able to freely make choices. People in the low control condition rated their self-determination as lower, which in turn led to reduced time cycling. This suggests that high levels of control can improve self-determination — and, indirectly, increase self-motivated behaviour, even outside of the workplace.</p>



<p>This last point is key. What we do at work (or perhaps more accurately, what is done to or imposed on us) doesn’t just affect the hours we spend in the office, in the factory, or on the shop floor. Rather, these things seep into our personal lives, making us more or less likely to use leisure time the way we might want. The team suggests that other mechanisms could also play a role in the link between job demands and exercise: for instance, if people are unable to “switch off” from work demands, this may hamper motivation to engage in activities like working out.</p>



<p>Either way, it is clear that jobs with high levels of demand can impact not only our overall wellbeing but our motivation outside of work. The team suggests that employers should place greater importance on self-determination and participation; and, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/09/involvement-in-workplace-democracy-can-alter-your-view-of-authority/">other research suggests</a>, this could also change how democratic, just and participatory workplaces are.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/A3RHpxFPTbk/">Partnering with TCC Africa</a></h4>

<p>Author: <strong>Roheena Anand</strong>, Director, Global Publishing Development, PLOS</p>



<p>Two weeks ago we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Open for Whom?</a>” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  </p>



<p>Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. </p>



<p>Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  </p>



<p><strong>Today</strong>, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Training Centre in Communication</a></strong>, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as <strong><a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TCC Africa</a></strong>. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.</p>



<p>Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.</p>



<p>We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper "Event-Driven Sensing for Efficient Perception: Vision and Audition Algorithms".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.</p>

<p>You want to choose a new vacuum cleaner, or book, or hotel, or kids’ toy, or movie to watch — so what do you do? No doubt, you go online and check the star ratings for various options on sites such as Amazon or TripAdvisor, and so benefit from the wisdom of crowds.</p>



<p>However, there are problems with this star-based system, as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01098-5">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> makes clear. Firstly, most ratings are positive — so how do you choose between two, or potentially many more, products with high ratings, or even the same top rating? Secondly, star ratings aren’t a great predictor of the success (and so actual general appeal and approval) of a movie, book, and so on, note Matthew D. Rocklage at the University of Massachusetts and his colleagues. The team presents an alternative method for picking the best product and also predicting success, which focuses on the emotional responses of the reviewers.</p>



<span id="more-42060"></span>



<p>In all four studies reported in the paper, the team used a text analysis tool called the Evaluative Lexicon. This provided measures of the average emotionality and valence (positivity) of a review. Emotionality relates to how much an attitude is rooted in emotion, rather than how positive or negative it is (so reviews that included lots of terms like “awe-inspiring” or “enchanting” got higher emotionality scores than reviews with terms like “impeccable”.)</p>



<p>First, the team looked at the earliest 30 reviews for all movies included on the website metacritic.com from 2005 to 2018. For each movie, they gathered star ratings (from 0 to 10), valence scores and measures of text emotionality.</p>



<p>Overall, 81% of these movies got above average star-ratings. This highlights “the challenge of discerning success and how people will behave in this sea of positive ratings”, which the team calls the “positivity problem”. They also found that star ratings weren’t a good predictor of box office revenue, and text valence wasn’t a helpful predictor, either. Higher emotionality was a positive predictor of future box office takings, however. (This result held when they controlled for a variety of factors, including the genre of the movie, the year it was released, its budget, and so on.)</p>



<p>Next, Rocklage and colleagues used the same approach to try to predict the sales of all books listed on Amazon.com from 1995 to 2015. This time, for some genres, star ratings did predict sales, while for others they didn’t. However, greater emotionality emerged as a predictor of sales across 93 different genres. It was, then, consistently useful.</p>



<p>The researchers then turned to 187,206 real-time tweets posted in response to TV ads for 84 different businesses played during the 2016 and 2017 US Super Bowls. The team found that the greater the emotionality of the tweets about an advert, the more Facebook followers the company gathered over the next two weeks. The equivalent of star ratings for these ads had been gathered by the newspaper USA Today, and these ratings were not predictive of followers.</p>



<p>Finally, the team considered Chicago restaurant reviews on yelp.com and 1.3 million table reservations made on a popular booking website. In contrast to earlier results, high star ratings did predict more table reservations. However, higher emotionality still emerged as a unique predictor of numbers of bookings. As the team writes, “restaurants that elicited more emotion were associated with more table reservations”.</p>



<p>Overall, then, movies, books and restaurants that appeared to evoke more emotion in consumers ended up being more successful. Why might that be the case? Emotions flag memories as being important, and are relatively readily recalled, and attitudes based on emotion <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/19/opinions-based-on-feelings-are-surprisingly-stable/">tend to be more stable</a>. Clearly this could influence a person’s own behaviour. “Additional work could explore whether attitudes based more on emotion also affect success by increasing individuals’ propensity to spread information via word of mouth,” the team notes.</p>



<p>Overall, the new work does call into question the validity and helpfulness of star ratings. This in itself is not new, but of course the researchers also describe what seems to be a more useful system, which in theory could be broadly adopted. “One possibility is that organizations could consider aggregating reviewers’ language and providing an ‘emotional star rating’ to provide more meaningful assessments to individuals,” they write.</p>

<p>Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2">in Neuron</a>, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.</p>



<p>Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq" /></figure>

<p>A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>



<p>The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.</p>



<h2>The five defining Brainhack features: </h2>



<p>1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving</p>



<p>2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods</p>



<p>3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators</p>



<p>4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and </p>



<p>5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages</p>



<p>Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. </p>



<p>Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. </p>



<p><br />Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.</p>



<p>The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a <a href="http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/">Jupyter Book </a> that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>What does being a good leader mean to you? Having tonnes of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/14/with-leader-charisma-its-possible-to-have-too-much-of-a-good-thing/">charisma</a>? Being <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/13/very-intelligent-people-make-less-effective-leaders-according-to-their-peers-and-subordinates/">intelligent</a>? Encouraging fairness and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/09/involvement-in-workplace-democracy-can-alter-your-view-of-authority/">participation in the workplace</a>? Whatever combination of qualities you value, it’s likely that your vision of good leadership is different from your colleague’s or your manager’s, who themselves will have a highly personal vision of who they want to be at work.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12447">new study</a> from Remy E. Jennings at the University of Florida and colleagues, published in <em>Personnel Psychology</em>, looks closely at this individualised idea of leadership — our “best possible leader self”. If we focus and reflect on this best possible self every morning, they find, it could help us behave more like a leader in the here and now.</p>



<span id="more-42052"></span>



<p>Participants were 54 students (mainly White men) enrolled on a weekend MBA course in the United States, chosen because they were likely to aspire to leadership. All participants were in the intervention condition for five days and the control condition for five days.</p>



<p>In the intervention condition, participants were asked to write expressively every morning in response to the prompt “think about your best possible self in a leadership role sometime in the future. Imagine everything has gone as well as it possibly could for you. Think of this as the realisation of the best possible leader you could ever hope to be”. During this period, participants were also asked to reflect on positive traits, useful skills and achievements they felt they had and that could help them become this best possible leader.</p>



<p>In the control condition participants wrote instead about three neutral objects, describing their car, objects in their office, or landmarks they saw on their way to work. Positive and negative affect was measured in both conditions.</p>



<p>The rest of the day was the same in both conditions. In the afternoon, a follow-up survey looked at “helping” behaviours, with participants asked whether they had mentored or helped someone at work or given encouragement or appreciation to colleagues, and “visioning” behaviours: whether participants had spoken about future opportunities or strategic goals during their day. </p>



<p>Finally, in the evening, participants responded to two measures. One, looking at leader identity, required participants to indicate how much they agreed with statements such as “today, I displayed the characteristics of a leader”; the other invited them to describe their day in their own words and was later analysed for feelings of high expertise and confidence.</p>



<p>The results showed that reflecting on the best possible leader self increased participants’ positive affect, which in turn was associated with more helping behaviours and with vision-related behaviours during the work day. Those engaging in both helping and vision-related behaviours also felt more like they had behaved like a leader that day, and showed more “clout” — the feelings of high expertise and confidence as measured in the evening survey.</p>



<p>The study suggests that a period of envisioning and reflecting on the best possible leader self could make people more helpful and more confident in their leadership abilities. There are, however, limitations. Firstly, the small sample size was overwhelmingly made up of White men: would such an intervention have the same impact for other groups? Similarly, it’s important not to take the results as a straightforward ticket to success in the workplace. Self-reflection may be beneficial for many, but there may also be systemic factors working against promotion or increased clout for women, people of colour, or others who can be marginalised at work.</p>



<p>It would also be interesting to explore the actual content of participants’ best possible leader selves. Results from the study suggest that self-reflection of any kind can increase prosocial helping behaviours — but what if somebody’s best possible leader self is authoritarian and harsh with employees, or focused merely on power rather than collectivity or helpfulness? Looking at the range of “leader selves” and how they interact with workplace behaviours could give further insight.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many of us are familiar with the “bouba/kiki”, or “maluma/takete” effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the words “bouba” or “maluma” and spiky shapes with “kiki” or “takete”. These findings hold for speakers of many different languages and ages, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/20/we-find-some-word-sounds-more-emotionally-arousing-than-others/">various explanations for the effect have been proposed</a>.</p>



<p>But these studies have almost exclusively used made-up words (like these four), note the authors of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01883-3">new paper</a> in <em>Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review</em>, who have found that the effect is also at play in the English language. That is, the components of made-up words that we commonly pair with a round shape tend also to be found in nouns that refer to actual round objects, and the same for spiky sounds and objects.</p>



<span id="more-42045"></span>



<p>David M Sidhu, now at University College, London, and colleagues recruited 171 student participants in Canada. Each person was presented with 100 sets of six concrete nouns, and for each set, had to choose the two nouns that they felt referred to the “most round” and “most spiky” objects — so, for example, they had to pick the most-round and most-spiky objects from “unicycle”, “moon”, “balcony”, “pyramid”, “jet” and “driller”. From these results, the researchers generated a spiky/round rating for each word. (The top five “roundest” in order were : softball, ball, olive, pea and globe, while spike, fork, porcupine and scalpel led the “spikiest” object list.)</p>



<p>The team then looked at the phonemes, or distinct “units” of sound, which made up these nouns. They compared these results with those from earlier studies that have investigated which phonemes in made-up words are generally associated with roundness or spikiness.</p>



<p>Almost all of the phonemes previously associated with roundness were indeed present in the real words that participants identified as referring to round objects, and the same for spikiness. So the sounds <em>u</em> as in “up”, <em>m</em>, <em>oo</em> as in boot and <em>b</em> were more common in nouns that referred to round objects, while the sounds <em>k</em>, <em>t</em> and <em>i</em> as in “ship” were more common in nouns that referred to spiky objects. “Our main finding was that many of the associations between phonemes and shapes found in laboratory tasks are attested in the pairing between sound and meaning in English,” the team writes.</p>



<p>There were a few unexpected findings. For example, in this study, in contrast to some earlier ones involving made-up words, <em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> were more common in words for spiky objects. However, this result does fit with work linking certain phonemes to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/">greater or lesser emotional arousa</a>l. We tend to perceive words with hissing sounds as being higher in emotional arousal — which is also linked to spikiness. The researchers also note that these phonemes, along with other consonants common in words for spiky objects, require the involvement of the tongue, whereas <em>m</em>, <em>b</em>, etc are made just with the lips.</p>



<p>This work contributes to the argument that (in addition to cases of onomatopoeia) there is at least some relationship between the sound of words in English and what they refer to. This isn’t a powerful relationship; as the researchers themselves stress: “Many other factors play larger roles in the form of language.” Still, the work does reveal some consistent round/spiky patterns in real English words, which seems to be a first in almost 100 years of research into this effect.</p>

<p><strong>“Grumpy” dogs may be better learners than their more agreeable counterparts</strong>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/science/dogs-intelligence-learning.html">reports James Gorman</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>. Researchers found that grumpier canines were better at learning how to reach an object placed behind a fence by observing a stranger. But other scientists suggest that something more specific than “grumpiness” is responsible for the animals’ superior performance, such as increased aggression, reduced inhibition, or hyperactivity.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Jealousy is a fairly common human emotion — and for a long time, it was presumed it truly was only human. Some <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781444323542.ch2">have argued</a> that jealousy, with its focus on social threat, requires a concept of “self” and a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/27/a-promising-study-suggests-teachers-can-train-8-year-olds-in-theory-of-mind/">theory of mind</a> — being jealous of someone flirting with your partner, for example, requires a level of threat (real or imagined) to your relationship. This element of jealousy has been used to argue that animals, without such a sense of self, are therefore unable to experience it.</p>



<p>However a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620979149">new study</a>, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests this might not be the case. Amalia P. M. Bastos and team from the University of Auckland find evidence that dogs may, in fact, be able to mentally represent the threatening social interactions that give rise to jealousy.</p>



<span id="more-42024"></span>



<p>Some previous research has already suggested that dogs get jealous — one <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27251-1">2018 study</a>, for example, found that dogs would move in between or push owners away from interactions with fake dogs. But that research didn’t provide conclusive evidence that the dogs were actually experiencing jealousy.</p>



<p>In the new study, the team recruited 18 dogs and their owners: all dogs had been in the household for at least six months, were non-aggressive and showed no signs of discomfort within the experimental setting, removing the possibility that they would move towards a fake dog out of aggression or fear.</p>



<p>The owner sat behind a large barrier, wearing a blindfold and noise-cancelling headphones. The dogs were placed around five metres away, tied to a door frame attached to a force gauge in order to measure how hard they pulled on their leash.</p>



<p>In the fake dog condition, a realistic-looking fake dog was placed next to the owner behind the barrier. The barrier was then moved across the room for five seconds in order to reveal the fake dog to the real dog. When the barrier was moved back, blocking the view of the fake dog, the owner was instructed to pet and talk to it as if it were real.</p>



<p>In the cylinder condition, on the other hand, owners were shown petting and talking to a fleece cylinder behind the barrier. The realistic looking fake dog was still in the room, however, placed behind a separate, smaller barrier and revealed to the real dog.</p>



<p>Dogs in the fake dog condition pulled significantly harder on their leashes than those in the fleece cylinder condition, suggesting that the dogs were attempting to break up the interaction between their owner and a perceived rival. The fact that the fake dog was present during the cylinder trials is important, showing that the mere <em>presence</em> of a rival wasn’t enough to invoke jealous behaviours: it was the actual interaction with the dog’s owner that led to increased jealous behaviour. When the dogs were later allowed to reach the fake dog, the team also found that the dogs engaged in genital and face sniffing  —  suggesting that they believed the fake dogs were real throughout the study.</p>



<p>Overall, the dogs seemed to show “signatures” of jealous behaviour similar to those in humans: they reacted to a social partner engaging with a social rival (the fake dog) but not another object (the fleece cylinder), and didn’t react when the rival was in the room but not engaging with their owner. And most strikingly, they reacted strongly even though they couldn’t directly see the interaction between the owner and rival. Together, this suggests that dogs do indeed experience some form of jealousy, and can even mentally represent the social interactions that give rise to jealous feelings.</p>



<p>This insight is important for several reasons, not only confirming previous research on jealousy in dogs but suggesting that dogs may have more complex cognitive abilities than we might assume. This may indicate the ability to conjure other mental representations in different situations  —  and a much richer inner life than we currently understand.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper "Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.</p>

<p>A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. </p>



<p>On his blog <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/">For Better Science</a> (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. </p>



<p>Webster has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22">69 papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. </p>



<span id="more-2562"></span>



<p>Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board">Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine</a>, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C">here</a>. </p>



<p>The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C">explained by the first author on PubPeer </a>as  “<em>the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles</em>” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/">This Image Is Fine Award</a> in November 2020. </p>



<p>The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote <em>“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”</em>. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. </p>

In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE" rel="nofollow">https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C" rel="nofollow">https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C</a></figure>



<p>Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5">International Journal of Nanomedicine</a>, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. </p>



<p>Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. </p>



<p>As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. </p>



<p>Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Mindfulness — in basic terms, the practice of being “present” in the moment and paying attention to one’s own thoughts and feelings — has seen something of a boom over the last few years. In the United States, the mindfulness business is set to reach a value of $2 billion by next year, while in the United Kingdom, lockdown <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/mindfulness-apps-coronavirus-lockdown-explained-chilled-headspace-448667">saw a spike in downloads for digital meditation offerings</a> such as Headspace and Calm. </p>



<p>But is mindfulness all it’s cracked up to be? While it certainly has its benefits, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality">some argue</a> that it encourages blind acceptance of the status quo, taking us so far into ourselves that we forget the rest of the world. In <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xhyua/">a new preprint</a> on <em>PsyArxiv</em>, Michael Poulin and colleagues from New York’s University at Buffalo also find that mindfulness can decrease prosocial behaviours — at least for those who see themselves as independent from others.</p>



<span id="more-42014"></span>



<p>The first study was designed to look at the impact of mindfulness on prosocial activity, and in particular whether this depends on a person’s “self-construal”. In short, if someone has an independent self-construal they see the self as separate from others, rather than thinking more collectively and conceptualising themselves as part of a wider group.</p>



<p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, one oriented around mindfulness meditation, and the other focusing on a control meditation in the form of mind wandering. Those in the mindfulness condition listened to a tape designed to induce mindfulness through mindful breathing, while those in the mind wandering condition were instructed to “let your mind wander and think freely without needing to focus hard on anything in particular”.</p>



<p>After listening to the tapes, participants read about a local poverty and homelessness charity, before being asked whether or not they wanted to stuff envelopes in support of the organisation. Participants who decided to take part were left to do so for as long as they wanted. The team also measured participants’ self-construal by asking them to indicate how much they identified with friends, family, and wider groups compared to how much they thought of themselves as independent.</p>



<p>Most participants (84%) stuffed at least some envelopes after the task, though the number varied significantly  —  some stuffed up to 158, while others did just one. People who participated in the mindfulness meditation stuffed 15% more envelopes than those who did the control mediation — if they had an interdependent self-construal. But for those with independent self-construals, mindfulness <em>decreased</em> the number of envelopes stuffed by 15%.</p>



<p>The second study replicated the first: this time, however, the team attempted to manipulate participants’ self-construal. Participants were asked to go through a paragraph selecting all of the pronouns. In the independent condition, participants selected singular pronouns (“<em>I</em> went to the city”) and in the interdependent condition, they selected plural pronouns (“<em>we </em>went to the city”).</p>



<p>As the second study took place online, participants were not asked to stuff envelopes, but instead to sign up (or not) for time slots to chat online with alumni donors to request financial support for the same charity. And similar to the results of the first study, those primed with independent self-construal were less likely to volunteer after listening to the mindfulness exercise, while those in the interdependent condition saw an increased likelihood of volunteering after the mindfulness task.</p>



<p>Other research has found similar results; one 2017 study, for example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/17/mindfulness-training-does-not-foster-empathy-and-can-even-make-narcissists-worse/">found that mindfulness did not have the empathy-boosting benefits</a> that many of its adherents had claimed, at least in those high in narcissistic traits. This latter finding seems key: as in this study, it may not be that mindfulness decreases empathy or prosocial behaviours across the board, but only in combination with particular personality types. After all, interdependent participants saw an <em>increase</em> in prosocial behaviours, not a decrease.</p>



<p>Developing a more nuanced view of the benefits of mindfulness, then, might be one way of dealing with this issue. Following its meteoric rise, mindfulness has often been positioned as a panacea, not only for anxiety or other mental health conditions but in other areas, too: productivity, creativity, personal relationships, and particular traits or habits. Rather than treating it as a wholesale good, however, it may be better to understand when mindfulness might be truly beneficial — and, importantly, for whom. </p>



<p>– <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xhyua/">Minding your own business? Mindfulness decreases prosocial behavior for those with independent self-construals</a> [this paper is a preprint, meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]</p>

<p><strong>Author: </strong><em>Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE</em></p>



<p>PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">launch</a> of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in <em>PLOS ONE</em> earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  </p>



<p>Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>The first, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435">Satoru Joshita and colleagues</a>, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. </p>



<p>The second, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791">John Cole and colleagues</a>, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols">Submission Guidelines</a> have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. </p>



<p>We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols">Lab Protocol</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. This unique article type was developed in partnership with <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a>, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! </p>



<p>Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If somebody else has treated you badly, what are the best strategies for overcoming this, and moving on?</p>



<p>There has been, of course, an enormous amount of research in this field, in relation to everything from getting over a romantic break-up to coping with the after-effects of civil war. Now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64856-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>, led by Saima Noreen at De Montfort University, specifically investigates how different types of forgiveness towards an offender can help people who are intentionally trying to forget an unpleasant incident.  </p>



<span id="more-41993"></span>



<p>As the name implies, “intentional forgetting” involves actively trying to suppress memories of an unpleasant experience. Recent studies have suggested that this <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(18)30177-3?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661318301773?showall=true">lessens the associated negative emotions</a>. Forgiveness has been more extensively investigated, and there is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965714_Forgiveness_interventions_and_the_promotion_of_resilience_following_interpersonal_stress_and_trauma">work finding that forgiving the perpetrator helps</a> (though of course not all victims feel able or willing to forgive, and <a href="https://medium.com/invisible-illness/does-healing-from-trauma-require-forgiveness-e5906fdf0149">forgiveness is not an essential component of recovery</a>).</p>



<p>Noreen and her colleagues set out to explore possible interactions between intentional forgetting and “decisional” vs “emotional” forgiveness. Decisional forgiveness is making the decision to forgive the perpetrator, and not to seek revenge — indeed, even to make efforts to maintain a relationship — but while still bearing a grudge. In contrast, emotional forgiveness involves getting rid of negative emotions towards the perpetrator and replacing them with positive ones.</p>



<p>In initial studies, the team presented online participants with this scenario: just as they are about to move in with their partner, they discover that their partner is having an affair. Participants were then encouraged to forget details  associated with this hypothetical unpleasant experience (e.g. a list of adjectives that described the offender). Some were also instructed to forgive the offender either through emotional forgiveness (to “wish that the offender experiences something positive or healing and to focus their thoughts and feelings on empathy”) or decisional forgiveness (“think of the offender as someone who has behaved badly and that you have resolved not to pay her/him back and to treat him/her in a positive, rather than a negative way”.)  Others had no forgiveness intervention.</p>



<p>The team found that participants in the emotional forgiveness group showed greater forgetting of the detail, though not the gist, of the offence than the other groups. These participants also reported feeling more psychological distance from the offence.</p>



<p>These studies involved hypothetical offences, however. For the final online, two-stage study, the team recruited 360 fresh participants. In the first of two sessions, these people were guided to write in detail about a time in their life when someone close to them had done something that deeply offended, harmed or hurt them and that still left them feeling angry or resentful. Next, they rated various aspects of this experience, including the extent to which they had forgiven the perpetrator.</p>



<p>Between 7 and 11 days later, these participants then completed the second session. This included the same three-group forgiveness intervention as in the earlier studies. The team’s analysis revealed that for these participants, emotional, but not decisional, forgiveness was associated with greater forgetting of the detail of the original transgression (though again not the gist of it). It was also associated with a shift to reporting feeling more forgiveness for the perpetrator.</p>



<p>“Collectively, our findings suggest that the act of emotional forgiveness leads to a transgression becoming more psychologically distant, such that victims will construe the event at a higher and more abstract level,” the team writes. (In other words, retaining the gist, but not all the detail). “This high-level construal, in turn, promotes larger intentional forgetting effects, which, in turn, promote increased emotional forgiveness,” they go on.</p>



<p>This research does support some earlier suggestions that to function as a coping strategy, forgiveness should take an emotional form. And there are clear potential implications for strategies designed to help people recover psychologically from an offence. However, more work is clearly needed to explore this apparent “virtuous circle”, and to get a better handle on potential effects in the real world.</p>

<p>To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>; see also <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012">Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012</a>). Is this a problem?</p>



<p>Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324">Roche et al., eLife, 2019</a>). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493">Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020</a>), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.</p>



<p>For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial <a href="http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater">objective heating device</a> with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author <a href="https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038">Serge Charpak</a> was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy <a href="https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html">thermocouple</a> element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.</p>



<p>Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6792" data-attachment-id="6792" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="heating_pad" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,606" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000" />Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.</figure>



<p>Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6794" data-attachment-id="6794" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="constantan" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,641" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000" />Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.</figure>



<p>To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (<a href="https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx">this one</a>). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.</p>



<p>Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was <a href="https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf">this one</a>) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (<a href="https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/">explained here</a>). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6796" data-attachment-id="6796" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="thermosensor" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,666" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/thermosensor/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=1000" />A repurposed heating block to read out a thermistor. We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.</figure>



<p>The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.</p>



<p>Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! </p>



<p>The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.</p>

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JdJdcrkMka4/">The importance of early career researchers for promoting open research</a></h4>

<p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS’ Director of Open Research Solutions</p>



<p><em>Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers – as found in PLOS research released as a<a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/"> preprint this week</a>.</em></p>



<p>At the end of March 2021 <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">introduced</a> a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal’s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large – determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal’s community of editors and researchers.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725">more than 40%</a> of papers published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>voluntarily shared their code already, <em>requiring</em> more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:<br /></p>



<ul><li>Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?</li><li>What proportion of researchers’ papers generate code?</li><li>What concerns do they have about code sharing?</li><li>How common are these concerns?</li><li>How much would submissions to the journal be affected?</li><li>Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?</li></ul>



<p>Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025">survey dataset</a> that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">released as a preprin</a>t. As well as supporting the journal’s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing – relative to other open research practices such as data sharing – and researchers’ experiences with sharing code and software.</p>



<p>The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which — at least in principle — would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns — a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents’ previous publications could have shared code.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18885" height="433" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png" width="1006" /></figure>



<p>Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 <a href="https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1">peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society</a>, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure 2.</em></strong><em> Respondents were asked “If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18886" height="249" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png" width="512" /></figure>



<p>Also, similar to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/">what we discovered about researchers’ needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020</a>, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share <em>their own</em> code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers’ code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal’s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility – and ultimately reuse – of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-health-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, represent the primary cause of mortality worldwide. An increasing volume of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accounts for the majority of recent surges in the global NCD burden.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, increasing humanitarian crises in LMICs have resulted in the global forced displacement of people reaching record highs, with the average length of displacement now greater than 20 years. Until recently, the problem of NCDs in conflict-affected populations was largely neglected. However, with growing awareness of the challenges NCDs represent in humanitarian settings, clinical guidance has been developed for chronic NCD care in LMICs.</p>
<p>Since 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"><em>Médecins Sans Frontières</em> (MSF)</a> has supported the Jordanian health system by providing multidisciplinary, primary level NCD care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians living in Irbid, Jordan. This week in <em>BMC Health Services Research</em>, <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06333-3">Ansbro <em>et al. </em></a>describe their experiences with MSF, adapting the <a href="https://www.re-aim.org/about/what-is-re-aim/">RE-AIM framework</a> to evaluate MSF’s program of NCD care.</p>
<p>RE-AIM is a framework consisting of five elements, <em>Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance</em>. The framework was originally developed to encourage program planners, evaluators, funders, and policy-makers to be more attentive to essential program elements, to improve sustainable adoption, and promote the implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions. In this study, through the use of mixed methods, Ansbro <em>et al.</em> examined the RE-AIM five key elements of the MSF Syrian refugee NCD program.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12355" style="width: 410px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12355 size-full" height="363" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/RE-AIM_resized-e1619620846606.png" width="400" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00143/full">Ory <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<h3><strong>Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption</strong></h3>
<p>Most areas of the program were viewed as acceptable to patients, staff, and stakeholders. Although the care was free, patients were burdened with indirect costs, like paying for transport, to attend clinics, potentially outweighing the benefits of ‘free’ care.</p>
<p>The program achieved good clinical outcomes for treating patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, more research in the future that uses longer follow-up periods is needed to understand the prevalence or outcomes of major complications of NCDs.</p>
<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>A key challenge for implementation was the impact of Syrian patients’ experiences of war, loss, and social suffering on their engagement with NCD care. Staff also shared concerns that they could not manage medical problems in isolation from the psychosocial issues patients faced and they felt ill-equipped to handle patients’ war-related trauma.</p>
<p>Patients and staff also reported that the referral pathways for specialist services were troublesome and confusing. Funding for specialist referral pathways was limited, even though MSF managed to secure additional funding. This highlights the need for future programs to securely implement specialist referral pathways, ensuring they are designed to be affordable and accessible from the start.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintenance </strong></h3>
<p>A key challenge for maintaining the program was cost. High costs were partly responsible for the program’s limited coverage and scope. However, there is room for adaptations. For example, MSF introduced nurse task sharing, which could lead to cost savings.</p>
<p>Another challenge here is the availability of highly qualified family medicine specialists, for the management of patients with complex needs. While MSF had access to a large number of highly qualified Jordanian staff on this occasion, this is often not the case in all humanitarian crisis settings. This issue is difficult to address, but the authors propose potential workarounds, like telemedicine, as a possible solution for future programs.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-12357 aligncenter" height="175" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-_unsplash_strip.jpg" width="450" />
<p>Research in humanitarian crisis settings is extremely difficult. Not only do governments and humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in effectively tackling NCDs in LMICs, but the evaluation of interventions in humanitarian settings is equally as challenging. Still, this study demonstrated that RE-AIM is a valuable tool to guide complex interventions in humanitarian crisis settings. Ansbro <em>et al.</em> bridge a knowledge gap in the delivery of care in humanitarian settings, however, more research is urgently needed to strengthen responses to NCDs in humanitarian crisis settings. Future programs need to focus on simplifying care models, reducing costs, and harnessing telehealth resources.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper "Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.</p>

<p class="">The inferior and superior olivary nuclei are distinct in function. The inferior olivary nucleus is typically subdivided into the <em>principal olive, medial accessory olive, </em>and <em>dorsal accessary olive</em>, and is thought to play an important role in movement, coordination, and movement-related learning. The superior olivary nucleus consists of the <em>lateral superior olive</em> and <em>medial superior olive,</em> as well as a number of surrounding nuclei known as the <em>periolivary nuclei</em>. The superior olivary nuclei are thought to be involved in hearing, and specifically with identifying the location of sounds.</p><p class="">The inferior olivary nuclei receive movement-related information from several sources, including the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/motor-cortex" target="_blank">motor cortex</a>. This includes information about current movement, body position, muscle tension, and intention. The inferior olivary nuclei use this information to communicate with the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum" target="_blank">cerebellum</a> to fine-tune movements and aid in movement-related learning. </p>

<p class="">The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlear</a> nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus" target="_blank">inferior colliculus</a>, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.</p><h2><br />References:</h2><p class="">Paul MS, M Das J.

<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731">Stevenson and Kording</a> (2011), the authors estimated that <a href="https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/">every 7.4 years, the number of neurons we can record with doubles</a>. Think of it as Moore’s law for brain recordings. Since then, <a href="https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/">Stevenson has updated the estimate</a>, which now stands at 6 years. Could it be that progress itself is accelerating? </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218">Matteo Carandini raised a question</a>: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">a double-exponential curve</a>: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img alt="Doubling times" height="528" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png" width="753" />image <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png">CC BY Steve Jurvetson</a></figure>



<p>But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662">Urai et al. (2021)</a> – generously released under a CC-BY license – and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (<a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times">code here</a>). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It’s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature – 4.5 years. </p>

<p>On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers – hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that’s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. </p>



<p>We can do one better – fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> – a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here’s what that looks like:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7617" data-attachment-id="7617" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png" data-orig-size="779,527" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/" height="276" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779" width="408" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time – and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7619" data-attachment-id="7619" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png" data-orig-size="752,555" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-7-2/" height="278" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-7.png?w=752" width="377" /></a></figure></div>



<p>These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 – of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7623" data-attachment-id="7623" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-9" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png" data-orig-size="783,527" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/image-9/" height="257" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=783" width="383" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, <a href="https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/">including Facebook</a>, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1">adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors</a> to electrophysiology. </p>



<p>Thus, this generalized Moore’s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes – but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter – <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995">and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this</a>.</p>



<p>Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time – perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain’t what it used to be, and it’s coming far faster than we’ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There’s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is – perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lATQ057kTUbbLJBB5YJDDQZ0u6TsnV3L?usp=sharing">Ian Stevenson re-did the analysis with slightly different models</a>, and found some slightly different results (longer doubling times than those reported here), from 4.5 to 5.6 years, depending on the assumptions. These are doubling times are nevertheless shorter than the ones reported previously in the literature so far, so the larger point still stands: the future is happening faster than we thought just a few years ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/ihstevenson/status/1387439844641628161">Read the thread here</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FJ2pmGTKCuU/">To boldly grow: five new journals shaped by Open Science</a></h4>

<p>We are extremely excited to announce the imminent launch of <strong>five new journals</strong>, our first new launches in fourteen years. These new journals are unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges and are rooted in the full values of Open Science:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/water" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Water</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a></li><li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></li></ul>



<p>But, before we go on, let’s address this: “Yet more journals?” (Yes, we heard you…!)</p>



<p>Yes. We set out, with our original <a href="https://plos.org/publish/submit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seven journals</a>, to transform research communication by making research content openly accessible. <a href="https://plos.org/about/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Over the eighteen years since our first journal launch</a> we’ve helped prove the viability of Open Access which, despite the occasional disagreement about how best to achieve it, is now a mainstream notion. We changed the publishing landscape via <em>PLOS ONE</em>, and this new type of “mega-journal” now features at almost every publisher and in every research field. We helped focus the conversation about peer review on rigor and transparency, and more people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions. And, via open data policies, open peer review options, protocols, preregistration, preprint facilitation, etc., we’ve worked towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the <strong>entire research communication process</strong>, not just our journals. </p>



<p>All this is to say that we do not take lightly the responsibility of introducing new journals into the world. While we don’t believe the long-term future of research communication is always going to be the journal as we know it today, we do appreciate the impacts that journals can still have, and the new <strong>communities of practice </strong>they can empower. </p>



<p>Therefore, we are launching these five journals in the spirit of them being additional <strong>change-making vehicles</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ve invited key members of the PLOS Leadership Team along with our CEO, Alison Mudditt, to field specific questions, below: </p>



<h4><strong><em>“Why launch new journals at this point in PLOS’ journey?” </em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Niamh O’Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>“We’re a nonprofit, driven by our <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mission</a>, and we need to adapt to continue to deliver on it. Even though Open Access is now widely adopted, and Open Science is advancing, there are still key voices missing. We are expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers. Researchers have always driven our mission forward, and in order for us to have a meaningful impact we need to include the broadest range of their voices, globally. This way, we ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. These new journals create new and diverse communities of practice, and ensure that they are at the forefront of shaping how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. </p>



<p>Additionally, all these journals will be underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. Our existing institutional models are our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Flat Fee agreement</a> models. We’ll talk more about our brand new models when the journals open for submissions, suffice to say that they are also not based on APCs. With all this said, author fee-based models will still be available for those authors who prefer or need them.”</p>



<h4><strong><em>“What are the special characteristics of these new journals?”</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Dan Shanahan, Publishing Director, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>“As Niamh says, our next phase of work is not just about Open Access. These new journals not only complement and naturally extend the existing PLOS suite of journals, but will hardwire a lens of social responsibility into sharing research. Via these new journals we can work together to address the most pressing ‘Openness’ issue specific to each field, and enable the researchers addressing these challenges, everywhere, to have the broadest impact. </p>



<p>In full alignment with the proposed <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a>, these titles will ensure diversity and equity of representation at all levels – editors, editorial boards, reviewers, authors – and will actively seek out research from under-represented communities. The journals will play a part in broader efforts to create a more equitable system of knowledge-sharing, accelerating and increasing the benefits of scientific endeavour for global society as a whole. </p>



<p>The new journals all focus on some of the world’s most globally-relevant issues, to which locally-relevant research can, and must, become more visible. This approach will directly challenge the unfortunate norm that most ‘global’ forums remain dominated by research from Western Europe and North America.”</p>



<h4><strong><em>“How will these journals contribute to the increased adoption of Open Science practices?”</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>“PLOS has always led on key Open Science matters, we are experimenters, but we’re also striving to be better listeners. We know a rigid approach to Open Science won’t foster equitable participation from all communities. As a publisher, we’ve never been driven by tradition, but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can understand and improve the system. We’ll continue to investigate and test new ways of sharing, assessing, and recognizing research. We’ll be partnering with leaders across research communities, and the Open Science communities, to enact change. Not every solution will be journal-shaped, but all our journals will be shaped by Open Science, enabling those who publish with us to join communities of practice. We can use our newly expanded journal portfolio to influence norms and advance Open Science practices in considered and appropriate ways. We stand firm on any policies like open data that promote rigor and advance trust in research, but we want to understand the specific challenges that such policies represent for new communities, and work with them to find solutions that empower them, in their contexts, to practice Open Science. Overall, we want to further empower new communities to join us and inform us, working more tightly together towards ever more trust in science.”</p>



<h4><strong><em>“How does this expansion of the portfolio fit into PLOS’ wider aims for the future?”</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS</strong></p>



<p>“PLOS has grown, times have changed, and how we deliver our mission has to evolve. Science is a global, collaborative enterprise. Challenging times help us see where we are and where we need to be. Global collaboration, transparency, and trust in science (and policies…and interventions…)  have all become recurring themes. We’re also coming to terms with how we, as a society, need to do a lot more to address systemic barriers to inclusion. How we think of ourselves as an organization, especially a research communication organization, isn’t separate from everything else going on in the world today. We have always worked to raise the bar for Openness. To continue this work we need to continue to grow – but not just in the traditional business sense, and not just in counting the number of journals we publish: we also need to, and have concrete plans to, spread our roots deeper, create more global hubs for PLOS, absorb researchers’ local practices more fully into our business, and, as others commented before me, ensure that any journal we publish is informed by local communities at a global scale, challenging problems, and rebuilding the system better.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1GkvF8JqjjU/">The MDAR Framework – a new tool for life sciences reporting</a></h4>

<p><em><strong>PLOS note:</strong> We are delighted to share this announcement by the MDAR Working Group <strong>(M</strong>aterials, <strong>D</strong>esign, <strong>A</strong>nalysis, <strong>R</strong>eporting)</em> <em>of a new framework for transparent reporting in the life sciences. PLOS has always put emphasis—through editorial policies and submission guidelines—on complete and transparent reporting to facilitate the analysis, trust, reproduction and reuse of the research we publish. We’ve supported and participated in the MDAR Working Group by sharing our experience and helping to develop and test the new reporting framework. We hope that the MDAR Framework will help bring consistency to journals reporting guidelines and make it easier for authors to adopt transparency norms. The MDAR Framework is consistent with what is practiced at PLOS and we will work with our editorial boards to explore the most effective ways to implement it.</em></p>



<p>Incomplete or imprecise reporting of life sciences research contributes to challenges with reproducibility, replicability, and biomedical applications. For the last three years we – a group of journal editors and researchers – have been working together to develop a new framework for transparent reporting of life sciences research. This framework has just been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118">published </a>in <em>PNAS</em>.</p>



<p>The MDAR Framework establishes the four domains – research Materials, Design, Analysis, and Reporting – in which we define both a set of basic minimum requirements, and best practice recommendations.</p>



<p>We were motivated to develop the MDAR Framework as part of our own and others’ attempts to improve reporting to drive research improvement and ultimately greater trust in science. Existing tools, such as the <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines">ARRIVE </a>guidelines, guidance from <a href="https://fairsharing.org/">FAIRSharing</a>, and the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network</a>, speak to important sub-elements of biomedical research. This new MDAR Framework aims to be  more general and less deep, and therefore complements these important specialist guidelines.  </p>



<p>Previous approaches have led to improved reporting, but often at considerable cost to both authors’ and editors’ time. A recent period of experimentation has resulted in a thorough but fragmented landscape of reporting guidelines for life science journals. A drive for efficiency  inspired us to learn from each other’s experiences and to harmonize the most effective practices. </p>



<p>The MDAR Framework provides flexibility along with broad applicability. The standard articulation of expectations across different journals will make it easier for: (i) authors to better understand what is expected of them, and (ii) for more journals to adopt an established approach rather than develop it from scratch. Journals can choose a level of implementation appropriate to their needs, enabling greater adoption potential. </p>



<p>We also hope that the MDAR Framework will be helpful for other organizations such as funders, who can signal reporting expectations early and therefore have an effect at the time the studies are designed, and tool/software developers, who can devise means of facilitating compliance for authors and journals. </p>



<p>Alongside the framework, the project provides a checklist (for authors, journals or reviewers) as an optional implementation tool, and an explanation and elaboration document. The checklist was piloted on over 289 manuscript submissions across 13 journals, seeking feedback from authors and editors actually using the checklist. Our team analysed agreement between observers, sought feedback from outside experts, and revised the framework in the light of this experience. </p>



<p>The full set of MDAR resources will be maintained and updated as a community resource, in a Collection on the Open Science Framework. </p>



<p>We are sharing this update on the MDAR Framework through coordinated posts on working group member platforms. Working group members have been free to add any additional context as appropriate.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/26666/accepted">Characterization of an open access medical news platform readership during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

Abstract:  Background:

There now exists many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up-to-date with medical literature. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Objective:

The current study aimed to employ readership and survey data to characterize open access medical news readership trends in relation to COVID-19 in addition to overall readership trends regarding pandemic related information delivery.

Methods:

Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale.

Results:

COVID-19 articles had significantly more median views than non-COVID-19 articles (296 vs. 110, U = 748.5, P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average read times or bounce rate. Non-COVID-19 had more median actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs. 2.5, U = 2070.5, P &lt; 0.05). On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), survey data revealed that 66% (78/119) of readers Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID-19 using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine versus direct journal access. A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (71.7%) than direct journal article access (50.8%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated reading one or less full length medical study following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (16.9% vs. 31.8%, P &lt; 0.05).

Conclusions:

There is a significantly increased readership in one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic, reinforcing that open-access physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers to stay up to date with medical literature.

<p>Have you ever walked past a baker’s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?  Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it’s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12348" height="225" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/bagel-1434064-300x225.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.</li>
<li>Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.</li>
<li>Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.</p>
<p>Results showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.  These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.</p>

<p>It is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12349" height="199" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-6165772_1920-300x199.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>With vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)</p>
<p>This has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.</p>

<p>In an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.  Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of “political skill” can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12350" height="200" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/politics-2361943_1920-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>The review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research.   The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five “thematic dimensions” which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.</p>

<p>Hands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the <strong>doorway effect</strong>, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.  Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12351" height="196" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/idea-3338440_1920-300x196.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>In a study recently published in <em>BMC Psychology</em>, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.</p>
<p>The results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person’s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper "Bursting Neurons Signal Input Slope".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common
firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they
represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to
determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features
of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells
indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial
arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal
dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a
computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to
investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that
trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives
sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially
on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the
number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a
graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in
terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are
several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur
preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et
al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a
simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our
observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst
duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This
possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for
correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/uuA7LujvZ4Y/">Editor’s tips for passing journal checks</a></h4>

<p>You’ve painstakingly mapped out your research goal: to answer that unanswered question. You’ve conducted your experiments, analyzed the results and written your paper. Now it’s off to a journal. And the process begins. PLOS editors have seen it all and want to help get your paper published as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>What does the journal office look for, and what are the potential pitfalls? More importantly, how can you ensure that your manuscript passes journal checks and moves on to peer review quickly? Here, PLOS staff discuss a few of the most common reasons why a manuscript is rejected during the initial technical check, and how to avoid them.</p>



<p>For a bit of background, after a manuscript is submitted to a scientific journal it undergoes a series of technical and ethical checks. Submissions that pass this initial screening go on to editorial assessment and peer review. Submissions that don’t meet requirements, or don’t provide enough information, may be returned to the authors for clarification. This can extend review times and even lead to a manuscript being rejected without review. Below are 5 checks and tips on how to smoothly get past them.</p>



<p><strong>Check #1: Sense check</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, does the manuscript make sense as a submission? Is it a scientific article? Are all the typical parts of an article (abstract, introduction, methods, results/discussion, figures citations) all present? Is the language clear and understandable?</p>



<p><strong>How to pass it: </strong>Make sure that your manuscript is complete, and that the writing is clear and unambiguous. Note that it doesn’t have to be perfect at this stage, just precise enough for fellow researchers in your field to understand and evaluate your work.</p>

<p><strong>Check #2: Journal fit and scope</strong></p>

        </div>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>Journals tend to specialize in particular subjects and types of studies. “The biggest reason we reject without review is scope.” Explains Kendall McKenzie, Managing Editor of <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope"> “</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope">Our scope page</a> breaks down the diseases and categories of research we’re interested in, and even specifically states the kinds of things we don’t consider.”</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> It comes down to submitting the right manuscript to the right publication. Carefully investigate the journal’s scope before submitting to ensure that your manuscript has a good chance of publication. If your particular article is on the edge of the journal’s expressed scope, or if you’re just not sure, search the journal for similar articles; if there are no comparable publications, your study is likely out of scope.</p>

<p><strong>Check #3: Acceptance criteria</strong></p>


      <div class=" block-image-text block-image-text--left" id="block-image-text--block_606e2137e3d0e">
        <div class="block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25">
          <figure>
            <img alt="" height="1024" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Laura-1024x1024.jpg" width="1024" />
                      </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>Laura Simmons, Managing Editor of <em>PLOS Genetics </em>agrees. “In addition to scope, our Editors in Chief and Section Editors may reject without review if a submission is lacking in biological or mechanistic insight (i.e. if it is too descriptive), or if the research doesn’t represent a significant advance in the field.”</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> This one is all about doing your research. Different journals have different criteria for publication. Consult the journal website and consider whether your study fulfills the requirements and mission of the journal. Does the journal publish the type of research your study describes? Will your article appeal to the readers the journal serves? If not, consider a more specialized publication that focuses specifically on the type of research you are conducting, or, alternatively, a journal with a broader, more inclusive scope.</p>



<p><strong>Check #4: Plagiarism</strong></p>


      <div class=" block-image-text block-image-text--left" id="block-image-text--block_606e2181e3d0f">
        <div class="block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25">

                      </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>Most journals run an automated check that looks for similarities between your manuscript and previously published works. If the manuscript scores above a certain threshold, members of the journal staff will take a closer look at your manuscript to ensure that any direct quotes are framed within quotation marks and properly cited. “Overall the most common issue we see is authors reusing their own methods section, introduction, or conclusion from previous or related studies,” explains <em>PLOS ONE</em> Publishing Editor Emma Stillings. Authors don’t always realize that “you have to cite everyone, even yourself, to avoid any delay in the peer review process.”</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> Any direct quotes <em>must </em>be framed within quotation marks and properly attributed. That includes your own prior works. Try to avoid reusing text, and especially copy-pasting from your other papers. Check to make sure that any summaries or allusions are properly cited as well.</p>



<p><strong>Check #5: Complete and consistent ethical, funding, data, and other statements</strong></p>



<p>If the statements in the submission form are unclear, lacking detail, or otherwise incomplete, the process will pause while the journal office contacts the authors for more information. Similarly, if the statements within the manuscript are different from those in the submission system, the journal office will work with the authors to reconcile them before the manuscript can advance.</p>



<p><strong>How to pass it:</strong> Label and save the paperwork from the early part of your research process: funding information, committee approval documents, permits, permission forms, patient disclosure statements, study designs, and any other materials. You may need them to complete your submission form. When you are ready to submit, proofread carefully to ensure that everything in your manuscript is up-to-date and clear. Double check to make sure that any placeholder text has been replaced with the final version.</p>
