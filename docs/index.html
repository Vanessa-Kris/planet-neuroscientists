              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-violence-mass-shootings-increase-united-states-data-uvalde-buffalo">Mass shootings and gun violence in the United States are increasing</a></h4>

              
                <p>On May 24, at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were killed by a shooter. Just 10 days earlier, a white gunman was accused of a racially motivated shooting in a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., that left 10 Black people dead. These tragic incidents are among the latest mass shootings to rattle the United States, the only country with<a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/2021-firearms-commerce-report/download"> more civilian-owned firearms than citizens</a>.</p>



<p>Sadly, mass shootings — the definitions of which vary — are just a fraction of the story. In the United States, gun violence incidents are on the rise. In 2021, nearly 21,000 people were killed by firearms (not including suicides), according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">Gun Violence Archive</a>, an online database of U.S. gun violence incidents. That’s a 33 percent increase from 2017, the year that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2200169?query=TOC">firearm-related injuries usurped motor vehicle crashes</a> as the most common cause of death among children and adolescents.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In that same time frame, active shooter incidents nearly doubled. The FBI designates an active shooter as “one or more individuals who are engaged in killing or attempting to kill in a populated area.” In 2021, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/fbi-designates-61-active-shooter-incidents-in-2021">61 such incidents</a> in the United States killed 103 people. In 2017, the number of incidents was 31, though deaths totaled 143.</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t think of an issue that requires more urgency and attention,” says Sonali Rajan, a school violence prevention researcher from Columbia University. “Gun violence is a solvable problem.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Active shooters</h3>



<p>Data collected by the FBI reveal a steady increase over the past 20 years in active shooter incidents, which the Bureau defines as “one or more individuals who are engaged in killing or attempting to kill in a populated area.”</p>

<p>In 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health awarded a combined $25 million in grants for research on gun violence prevention, ending a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-research-faces-roadblocks-and-dearth-data">25-year paucity of federal funding</a> in the field (<em>SN: 5/3/16</em>). During that decades-long financial drought, research on gun violence prevention relied on funds from private foundations and state grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the few state-funded institutions in the country is the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers University in Piscataway. The center conducts interdisciplinary research on the causes and prevention of gun violence, including homicides and suicides. Richard Barnes, the center’s assistant director, manages research projects that focus on suicide prevention and how social disparities relate to violence in Black and brown communities</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with Barnes and Rajan about U.S. gun violence, ways to help reduce it and what research is needed. The following conversations have been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What recent trends in gun violence in the United States stand out to you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan:</strong> Gun violence as a problem has only gotten worse over the past several years. There are on average about 100,000 Americans who are shot with a firearm every single year and an estimated 40,000 of those individuals die from their firearm-related injuries. [These numbers include suicides.] In the last couple of years, that number has gone up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> In the last two years, during the pandemic, there was a significant surge in gun purchasing. And we&#8217;ve seen increasing rates of homicides and interpersonal violence in our cities across the country. 2021 was a record-breaking year, with the most gun deaths period, including suicide. It was also record-breaking in the sense that a lot of Black and brown communities throughout the country experienced a significant increase in gun violence. [According to the CDC, the nearly 35 percent increase in overall firearm homicides from 2019 to 2020 – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7119e1.htm?s_cid=mm7119e1_w">rising from 4.6 to 6.1 deaths per 100,000 people</a> – hit Black communities particularly hard.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>This American problem of gun violence is significant, and I&#8217;m hoping soon that we are able to distance ourselves from this trend of increased gun violence, which is so devastating.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Why is gun violence so much worse in the United States than in so many other countries?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> We have to consider our unique difference in terms of gun ownership. We have way more guns than a lot of other countries. And where you have a lot of firearms, you are going to have more gun violence.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Gun ownership</h3>



<p>The United States has more than twice the number of guns per 100 people than any other country, data from the Small Arms Survey show. With 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, that means there are more guns in the United States than people.&nbsp;</p>

	</iframe></div>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What does research suggest can help reduce gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Again, where there are more firearms, there is more gun violence. So the first thing to consider is access to firearms. I&#8217;m not advocating that we shouldn&#8217;t have firearms, but that&#8217;s one way.</p>



<p>We also have<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neighborhood-outreach-can-reduce-inner-city-gun-violence"> violence interruption organizations</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/19</em>). Their role is to work locally with other organizations — a lot of times they work with law enforcement — to gather information about the effectiveness of outreach programs and do their best to prevent and intervene in those skirmishes that might lead to gun violence. We know that when those organizations run right, they can have an impact on reducing gun violence. It really focuses on and encourages investment in public safety within those communities. That&#8217;s not a cheap course of action, it takes resources. And it&#8217;s been really difficult to get those needed resources for folks in the community, and also the research.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Does increasing police presence help quell gun violence?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan</strong>: Increasing police is not a solution to gun violence. There is no evidence that that works. In fact, I think it&#8217;s important to underscore that police violence is a form of gun violence. Rather than increasing funding to the police, there are a number of things that we could do, such as investing in communities and in schools in ways that are far more effective at deterring gun violence.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> In the wake of the Texas school shooting, there’s been</strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/25/harden-schools-arm-teachers-uvalde/"><strong> talk about increasing campus security and arming teachers</strong></a><strong>. Is that effective?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan:</strong> There&#8217;s actually evidence that shows that criminalizing a school space [by increasing police presence] is hugely detrimental both for children and their learning outcomes, and it also disproportionately impacts children of color in very negative ways. That to me is a really good example of our school districts investing lots of money into practices that are not doing anything productive, and may in fact be having unintended negative consequences.</p>



<p>In the context of schools, there are a lot of things that actually have no evidence to support their effectiveness: metal detectors, zero tolerance policies, anonymous threat reporting systems and arming teachers with firearms. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that any of these kinds of safety strategies are actually effective at deterring gun violence in a school.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Rising gun violence</h3>



<p>In 2021, there were nearly 21,000 gun-related deaths in the United States, not counting suicides. That’s a 35 percent increase from just two years earlier, and part of an ongoing rise in U.S. firearm deaths, data from the Gun Violence Archive show.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What kind of research is needed to reduce gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> [At the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center], we&#8217;re speaking to people who have owned a firearm illicitly within the last five years. Our question is very different from the criminal question, which is where you get your firearms from. That question is fine, but we&#8217;re aiming to better understand the lived experience of illicit firearm owners, to better understand why they own guns. What is it about where they live, how they live and why they think they need a firearm?</p>



<p>I think a lot of times, people discount the lived experience, because they start and end with the question over whether it’s legal to own guns. They don’t ask the question of whether you should own a firearm. But if you&#8217;re living in an area that&#8217;s dangerous, where people get shot, how are you going to protect yourself, your family, your loved ones? So, we&#8217;re trying to answer that question, in hopes of being able to suggest: Here&#8217;s some meaningful things that can be done.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What other kinds of information can help prevent gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> <a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health">Social determinants</a> of health are the factors that either contribute or hinder communities from thriving [such as economic stability, social support, education and health care access]. There are so many similarities among communities that are struggling the most from gun violence. I think the conversation around gun violence has to include questions around how much [these social determinants] contribute to or impact what we understand about gun violence. And in particular, the increase or uptick in gun violence.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What is a major misconception in gun violence prevention?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan: </strong>That the solution to gun violence is entirely based on gun laws. The gun laws are an extremely important part of the gun violence prevention puzzle. But it is not the only part. We need to think about all of the ways in which we are attending to the health and well-being of children and adults. Like, why would a 14-year-old choose to carry a firearm to begin with? They fundamentally don&#8217;t feel safe and we as a society are failing our children. What are the big systemic factors that are driving this level of violence? We need to reimagine what gun violence prevention looks like.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What challenges do gun violence prevention researchers face?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Funding is the biggest one, but also having partners on the ground is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re a research institution, so there&#8217;s a lot of distrust that needs to be overcome when we enter a community. A lot of Black and brown communities feel like they&#8217;ve been poked and prodded, they’ve seen this before. We need to have relationships on the ground that start with trust, to figure out how we can get at some of the questions that may lead to recommendations and prevention methods that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do that, organizations on the ground need to be funded as well. Because if they go away, it makes it nearly impossible for us to penetrate those communities that have a well-reasoned fear of outsiders, in particular researchers. That&#8217;s the only way that you really get under the issue of gun violence in the community.</p>

                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Roheena Anand, Executive Director, PLOS Global Publishing Development</p>



<p>PLOS has made big leaps in the past year with the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">launch of five new journals</a>, piloting <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">business models</a> that will make Open Access publishing more equitable and expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our collaboration with the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/"> African Association of Universities (AAU) and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa)</a> is a visible way we are moving our mission forward and including the broadest range of voices, globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the 26th April, 2022, we publicly launched this collaboration via a webinar for Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors, Directors of Research and Directors of Libraries of African Universities. Our partnership will consist of a series of regional workshops across the African continent, focusing on increasing awareness and providing training around Open Science practices and Open Access publishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 60 leaders from African institutions were in attendance at the launch event. There was a vibrant panel of speakers, covering both global and local Open Science perspectives and initiatives. The program included representatives from UNESCO, the International Science Council, the African Open Science Platform and the African Librarian and Information Associations &amp; Institutions, thereby reflecting a broad range of stakeholder perspectives within the scholarly communication ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, importantly, we heard from the attending institutional leaders in breakout sessions focussed on the challenges of adoption of Open Science and Open Access mandates within their institutions.</p>



<p>We asked&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>What are the impediments to adopting Open Science mandates/policies in your institutions?</li><li>What needs to change to allow adoption and implementation of these mandates/policies?</li><li>What are the next steps for you? And what timelines are necessary to take these steps?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>What we learned will help us to shape the upcoming regional workshops to ensure they can provide value to local participants and provide a forum to collaboratively progress Open Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the main takeaways from these discussions were:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>There is still a lack of awareness overall on what Open Science is, and the implications it has for stakeholders within the scholarly communication ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li>Particularly, many misconceptions exist around Open Science and Open Access, e.g. the credibility of open peer review. Their benefits need to be clearer for stakeholders: authors, readers, as well as institutional stakeholders such as the Research Offices.&nbsp;</li><li>Academic libraries/librarians are often active in advocating for Open Science and Open Access within their institutions; therefore their involvement is and will be key in progressing adoption. They are, of course, well versed in these topics from their discussions with publishers and their roles with institutional repositories.</li><li>There are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">concerns around cost</a> (article publication charges) and intellectual property rights: <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/why-open-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if material is open, how can we ensure it is not subject to abuse/manipulation</a></li><li>Incentives for practicing Open Science are not embedded within research assessment and career progression</li></ul>



<p>Our aim with collaborations like these is to ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. Our work is ongoing and global: we have recently announced a partnership with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">EASTECO</a> in Africa, we have established PLOS GmbH in Berlin, and are exploring options in Asia and Latin America to help bring us closer to researchers and other stakeholder communities at the local level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">4 answers to key questions about the monkeypox outbreak</a></h4>

              
                <p>An outbreak of monkeypox has some people worried that the world is on the brink of another pandemic. That’s not likely, experts say.</p>



<p>The concern has been fueled by more than 300 confirmed or suspected cases of the disease cropping up in 21 countries outside Africa, where the disease is endemic, since May 7. It’s the most widespread outbreak of the disease, which causes flulike <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmonkeypox%2Foutbreak%2Fcurrent.html">symptoms</a>, such as fever, headaches and body aches, as well as profound weakness, back pain, swollen lymph nodes and rashes that erupt into pus-filled blisters. And <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEBhao3rMe-qtCbAgJTn5ZKQMRFWeAeaiXFpBY3gbHE/edit#gid=0">more cases are being added daily to a database</a> maintained by Global.health, a group that tracks infectious diseases.</p>





<p>Spain, Portugal, Canada and England have recorded most of the cases. In the United States, one person each in Massachusetts, California and New York City and two in Utah have been confirmed to have monkeypox, and four others are confirmed to have <em>Orthopoxvirus</em> infections, the genus that includes monkeypox and smallpox. Those cases — one in New York City and Washington state and two in Florida — are presumed to be monkeypox and are undergoing confirmation at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Monkeypox spreads through close contact. “Anyone — anyone — can develop and spread monkeypox infection,” John Brooks, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC said May 23 during a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/a0523-monkeypox.html">news briefing</a>. But “many of those affected in the current global outbreak identify as gay or bisexual men.”</p>



<p>Some of those cases have been <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10849239/Monkeypox-outbreak-sparked-sex-two-raves-Belgium-Spain-expert-warns.html">linked to a Pride celebration and a sauna</a> in Spain, and a fetish festival in Belgium. CDC officials hope to raise awareness of the sometimes-deadly disease ahead of June, Pride month in the United States and many other countries, Brooks said.</p>



<p>Right now, men who have sex with men may be at greater risk of contracting the virus, but “infectious diseases don’t care about borders or social networks,” Brooks said. Most people are at low risk of catching monkeypox, but should still be aware that it is circulating in the community, he said.</p>



<p>“There’s no need for panic. There’s no need for fear, and there’s no need to stigmatize anyone who has this disease,” Adesola Yinka-Ogunleye, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Global Health at University College London and a monkeypox expert with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.</p>



<p>But with cases on the rise, here’s what to know.</p>



<h4>What is monkeypox?</h4>



<p>Monkeypox is a DNA virus in the <em>Orthopoxvirus</em> genus, which includes smallpox, cowpox and camelpox. It is not a new disease, says Yinka-Ogunleye. The virus was first discovered in monkeys in 1958. The first human case appeared in 1970.</p>



<p>Mostly, monkeypox is a disease humans catch from animals. That’s what happened in the United States in 2003 when 47 people in the Midwest got <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/domestic-disease-exotic-pets-bring-pathogens-home">monkeypox from pet prairie dogs</a> that had been housed with infected rodents from West Africa (<em>SN: 06/11/03</em>).</p>



<p>There are two different types, or clades, of monkeypox. The more deadly type is the Central African or Congo Basin clade, which sickens hundreds of people each year in Congo and the Central African Republic. That clade, which kills about 10 percent of people it infects, hasn’t spread outside the region where it is normally found, Yinka-Ogunleye says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The West African clade is the one behind the current global outbreak. The disease it causes tends to be milder, killing about 1 percent to 3.6 percent of infected people.</p>



<h4>How did the current outbreak start?</h4>



<p>The outbreak is the latest resurgence of monkeypox, Yinka-Ogunleye says. “Before 2017, it used to be known as a rare disease,” she says. Fewer than 10 cases had popped up in Western Africa before then. For instance, Nigeria hadn’t had a case since 1978. But then <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004876/">a 2017 outbreak</a> there caused 42 confirmed cases and 146 suspected cases, she and colleagues reported in 2018 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers found evidence that the virus was being passed person-to-person through close contact with family members, though most cases probably came from animals. No one knows which animals are the reservoirs for monkeypox, though several rodents and other small animals are suspected to carry the virus.</p>

<p>Since 2017, Nigeria has had sporadic cases of monkeypox, mostly in urban areas, she says. The country has had 46 cases in 2022 as of April 30.</p>



<p>From time to time, travelers have carried monkeypox from Nigeria to other countries, but those have been mainly isolated cases. This outbreak may also have started with a traveler.</p>



<p>Genetic evidence from viruses isolated from patients in Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States suggests that <a href="https://virological.org/t/multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox-virus-genetic-divergence-and-first-signs-of-microevolution/806">the multinational outbreak may have had a single source</a>, researchers from Portugal reported May 23 at Virological.org.</p>



<p>“Our virus definitely comes from Portugal,” says Philippe Selhorst, a virologist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who posted the <a href="https://virological.org/t/belgian-case-of-monkeypox-virus-linked-to-outbreak-in-portugal/801">genetic makeup of the monkeypox virus from a Belgian patient</a> to Virological.org on May 20. The DNA sequence of the virus is very similar to ones from Portugal. The patient had traveled to Lisbon shortly before developing a rash, further solidifying the link. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Because monkeypox has DNA as its genetic material, it mutates more slowly than RNA viruses, such as dengue or SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. “I would expect all cases … in the outbreak to be very similar,” Selhorst says.</p>



<p>Still, virologists have noted mutations in the virus taken from different patients. That’s to be expected. “There’s always going to be differences between viruses,” he says. “The question is: ‘Is that difference relevant?’” Nothing in the viral DNA indicates that the virus has mutated to spread more easily from person-to-person, Selhorst says.</p>



<h4>How is the virus spreading?</h4>



<p>This outbreak seems to be driven by human-to-human transmission. “This virus has used a sexual network to spread around the world,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease — one that is passed through semen or other bodily fluids exchanged during sex, he says. “You can catch the flu if you make out with somebody, and people kiss during sex, but that doesn’t make influenza a sexually transmitted infection.” Similarly, close skin-to-skin contact during sex can spread monkeypox.</p>



<p>People infected with monkeypox may not have a visible rash, but could have lesions in their mouth or throats that harbor the virus and may pass the infection through saliva, the CDC’s Brooks said. Selhorst and colleagues are collecting semen and other body fluids from people infected with monkeypox to see if it is possible for the virus to be sexually transmitted.</p>



<p>In this outbreak, rashes have appeared first in people’s groin and anal regions, and have been mistaken for herpes or other STDs, Brooks said during the news briefing. And monkeypox cases are sometimes confused with chicken pox, Yinka-Ogunleye says. Doctors need to be aware that a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-1581">patient with a rash may have something more exotic</a>, Adalja and Hopkins colleague Tom Ingelsby warned May 23 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. If monkeypox is suspected, doctors should contact their state or local health department.</p>



<h4>How can the outbreak be stopped?</h4>



<p>In Nigeria, monkeypox outbreaks are controlled by isolating infected people and tracing close contacts, Yinka-Ogunleye says. Vaccines and antiviral medications are not available there for limiting the disease’s impact or spread, she says. Most of the time medication is not needed, as the body eventually clears the virus on its own, but people may be given other drugs as part of supportive care.</p>



<p>In Europe and the United States, close contacts of infected people may be vaccinated with either <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000">ACAM2000, an older vaccine against smallpox</a>, or with a newer vaccine called Jynneos. Made by vaccine company Bavarian Nordic, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox">Jynneos was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> in 2019 for use against smallpox and monkeypox. That vaccine has fewer side effects than the older vaccine and is safer for people with eczema or weakened immune systems.</p>

In the United States, close contacts of people infected with monkeypox may be vaccinated to prevent the disease.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3114147">James Gathany/CDC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>More than 1,000 doses of Jynneos are available in the United States’ Strategic National Stockpile, Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology said during the CDC news briefing. And the company expects to produce more soon. More than 100 million doses of the older vaccine are available.</p>



<p>So far, cases in this outbreak have been mild. But two antiviral drugs, called brincidofovir and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approves-first-smallpox-treatment-tpoxx">tecovirimat, developed against smallpox</a> might be used to treat severe monkeypox cases (<em>SN: 5/2/18</em>).</p>



<p>Most of the evidence that the drugs will work against monkeypox come from animal studies. But in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00228-6/fulltext">a tiny study in the United Kingdom</a>, three people who got brincidofovir as monkeypox treatment developed liver problems and had to be taken off the drug, researchers report May 24 in <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. One person given tecovirimat spent only 10 days in the hospital, compared with six other patients who stayed in the hospital between 22 and 39 days because they were still producing virus. Those numbers are too small to draw any conclusions about the treatment’s effectiveness.</p>



<p>People previously vaccinated against smallpox may still have some protection against monkeypox, too, says Aaron Glatt, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Mt. Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, N.Y., and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. But those numbers are dwindling. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 and most countries stopped vaccinating against the virus in the 1970s. That means many people 50 and younger have no immunity to smallpox or monkeypox.</p>



<p>“This is a negative to the eradication of smallpox,” he says. “But in the overall scheme of things, it’s a positive that we eradicated smallpox. Even if we have a handful of monkeypox cases as a consequence of not vaccinating for smallpox, it is [still] a very, very good exchange.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>It’s really common to start yawning after seeing someone else do it.  You might even be yawning right now, just reading about it. But we also instinctively know that there’s something a bit rude about yawning: we’re less likely to show this “yawn contagion” when we’re being watched, for instance. And even when we do yawn in the presence of others, we’ll often cover our mouth.</p>



<p>Why does yawning carry this stigma? The obvious explanation is that yawning indicates that we are tired or bored, and we might not want to make others feel like they are the source of that boredom (even if they are!). But the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922001994?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences </em>have another intriguing theory: we dislike yawning because it can be a sign of disease.</p>



<span id="more-46312"></span>



<p>There is some evidence that yawning is related to disease, note Mitch Brown from the University of Arkansas and colleagues. Certain neurological diseases can lead to abnormal yawning, for example, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938417303049">yawning may become more frequent</a> as someone develops a fever (some researchers argue that one of the purposes of yawning is to cool the brain, though <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140811-warning-this-may-make-you-yawn">this theory is contentious</a>). Yawns can also indicate fatigue, which is often brought on by illness. The team also points out that covering our mouth hardly hides the fact that we are yawning — in fact, it might even draw attention to it. So perhaps it is more akin to covering our mouths during a cough or sneeze: an action performed to avoid transmitting disease.</p>



<p>To see whether people think of yawning as a disease cue, the team asked 196 American undergraduates to complete various questionnaires. These included measures of their aversion to germs generally and fear of Covid in particular. They also indicated the extent to which they felt disgust in various scenarios, including those related to pathogens (for example, “Accidentally touching a person’s bloody cut”). Finally, participants rated how much they stigmatised yawns, as well as sneezes, coughs, and hiccoughs, by indicating how rude it was to perform that bodily function in front of others and how important it was to cover your mouth when doing it.</p>



<p>The team found that coughing and sneezing carried a higher degree of stigma than yawning, which in turn was stigmatised more than hiccoughing. But importantly, people’s levels of pathogen-related disgust and aversion to germs both predicted <em>how much</em> they stigmatised these bodily functions. Those who scored higher on these measures showed more stigmatisation of yawning, as well as coughing and sneezing (only aversion to germs was related to stigmatisation of hiccoughs).</p>



<p>The researchers argue that this shows we do indeed see yawning as a disease cue. The fact that people who are particularly concerned about disease and germs are more likely to stigmatise yawning — as well as clearer indicators of disease like sneezing and coughing — suggests they may see yawns as potential threats to their health. Fear of Covid didn’t further increase people’s stigmatisation of yawning, and the researchers suggest this shows that the stigma around yawning has “ancestral roots” rather than just cropping up during a pandemic.</p>



<p>However, there could be other explanations for the results. Perhaps people who are concerned about germs would rather avoid someone who is yawning not because it suggests they are sick, but simply because they don’t want to be breathed on. Or maybe these people have an aversion to seeing or thinking about bodily functions in general, whether or not these are actually related to disease. Further studies are needed to disentangle all of these possibilities before researchers can definitively conclude that we use yawns as a disease cue.</p>



<p>The study also doesn’t rule out other reasons that yawning carries a stigma. Yawning can of course indicate boredom and may be interpreted as disrespectful, so covering our mouths may simply be a non-verbal way to communicate that we’re not trying to be rude — even if it doesn’t really hide the yawn. There’s clearly a lot more work to be done to understand the purpose and meaning of this seemingly simple reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia">Lasers reveal ancient urban sprawl hidden in the Amazon</a></h4>

              
                <p>A massive urban landscape that contained interconnected campsites, villages, towns and monumental centers thrived in the Amazon rainforest more than 600 years ago.</p>



<p>In what is now Bolivia, members of the Casarabe culture built an urban system that included <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04780-4">straight, raised causeways running for several kilometers, canals and reservoirs</a>, researchers report May 25 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Such low-density urban sprawl from pre-Columbian times was previously unknown in the Amazon or anywhere else in South America, say archaeologist Heiko Prümers of the German Archaeological Institute in Bonn and colleagues. Rather than constructing huge cities densely packed with people, a substantial Casarabe population spread out in a network of small to medium-sized settlements that incorporated plenty of open space for farming, the scientists conclude.</p>





<p>Airborne lasers peered through dense trees and ground cover to identify structures from that low-density urban network that have long eluded land-based archaeologists.</p>



<p>Earlier excavations indicated that Casarabe maize farmers, fishers and hunters inhabited an area of 4,500 square kilometers. For about a century, researchers have known that Casarabe people fashioned elaborate pottery and constructed large earthen mounds, causeways and ponds. But these finds were located at isolated forest sites that are difficult to excavate, leaving the reasons for mound building and the nature of Casarabe society, which existed from about the year 500 to 1400, a mystery.</p>



<p>Prümers’ team opted to look through the Amazon’s lush cover from above, aiming to find relics of human activity that typically remain hidden even after careful ground surveys. The scientists used a helicopter carrying special equipment to fire laser pulses at the Amazon forest as well as stretches of grassland. Those laser pulses reflect data from the Earth’s surface. This technique, called light detection and ranging, or lidar for short, enables researchers to map the contours of now-obscured structures.</p>



<p>Looking at the new lidar images, “it is obvious that the mounds are platforms and pyramids standing on artificial terraces at the center of well-planned settlements,” Prümers says.</p>



<p>Prümers’ team conducted lidar surveys over six parts of ancient Casarabe territory. The lidar data revealed 26 sites, 11 of them previously unknown.</p>



<p>Two sites, Cotoca and Landívar, are much larger than the rest. Both settlements feature rectangular and U-shaped platform mounds and cone-shaped earthen pyramids atop artificial terraces. Curved moats and defensive walls border each site. Causeways radiate out from Cotoca and Landívar in all directions, connecting those primary sites to smaller sites with fewer platform mounds that then link up to what were probably small campsites or areas for specialized activities, such as butchering prey.</p>



<p>The Casarabe society’s network of settlements joins other ancient and present-day examples of low-density urban sprawl around the world, says archaeologist Roland Fletcher of the University of Sydney. &nbsp;These sites raise questions about whether only places with centralized governments that ruled over people who were packed into neighborhoods on narrow streets, such as 6,000-year-old Mesopotamian metropolises, can be defined as cities.</p>



<p>Some past urban settlements organized around crop growing spanned up to 1,000 square kilometers or more in tropical regions. These include locales such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-unveil-secrets-and-mysteries-angkor-wat">Southeast Asia’s Greater Angkor</a> roughly 700 to 800 years ago and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">interconnected Maya sites in Central America</a> dating to at least 2,300 years ago (<em>SN: 4/29/16</em>; <em>SN: 9/27/18</em>). Today, extended areas outside large cities, especially in Southeast Asia, mix industrial and agricultural activities over tens of thousands of kilometers.</p>



<p>Clusters of interconnected Casarabe settlements ranged in area from 100 square kilometers to more than 500 square kilometers. Spread-out settlements of comparable area include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-urban-megasites-may-reshape-history-first-cities">6,000-year-old sites from Eastern Europe’s Trypillia culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>Tropical forests that have gone largely unexplored, such as Central Africa’s Congo Basin, probably hosted other early forms of low-density urban development, Fletcher predicts.</p>



<p>Only further excavations guided by lidar evidence can begin to untangle the size of the Casarabe population, Prümers says. Whether primary Casarabe sites represented seats of power in states with upper and lower classes also remains unknown, he adds.</p>



<p>Casarabe culture’s urban sprawl must have encompassed a considerable number of people in the centuries before the Spanish arrived and Indigenous population numbers plummeted, largely due to diseases, forced labor and slavery, says archaeologist John Walker of the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</p>



<p>Whatever Casarabe honchos had in mind as their tropical settlement network spread, he says, “we may have to set aside some of our strongly held ideas about what the Amazon is, and what a city is, to better understand what happened.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/25/people-prone-to-mind-wandering-are-better-at-shifting-between-tasks/">People prone to mind-wandering are better at shifting between tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Letting your mind wander while you’re meant to be working on a task doesn’t sound like a particularly good idea. Indeed, psychologists have viewed mind-wandering in this context as a failing — specifically, a failure of executive control to maintain focus. Evidence that mind-wandering worsens performance on tasks that tap into working memory, for example, supports this idea. However, the full picture is not so neat…</p>



<p>Though older adults generally have poorer executive control than younger people, they tend to report <em>less</em> mind wandering. And some studies that required young adults to switch between various tasks have found that mind-wandering made no difference to their performance. This is &#8220;perplexing&#8221;, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810022000678?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a> in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em> — at least in the context of traditional theories. But Yi-Sheng Wong at the University of Otago, New Zealand, and colleagues report findings that support an alternative idea: that people who have a tendency to mind-wander enjoy greater &#8220;cognitive flexibility&#8221; — that is, they can shift more easily from one type of cognitive challenge to another.</p>



<span id="more-46292"></span>



<p>The team studied 79 undergraduate students, who were repeatedly shown a circle or a triangle on a screen. The shape was either large or small, and red or blue. In the first set of trials, the participants were told which aspect of the image — its shape, colour or size — they were to report on, via a keyboard, as quickly and accurately as possible. Sometimes this would be the same as the previous trial, but sometimes it would change so they were focusing on colour in one trial, say, and size the next. In the second, voluntary-switch set of trials, the participants could choose if and when they wanted to change — to start responding to colour instead of shape, for example. After they had finished both sets of trials, they completed questionnaires that assessed mind-wandering, among other things.</p>



<p>The team found that participants who reported having a relatively high tendency to spontaneously mind wander in daily life also rated themselves as having generally poorer attentional control. They were also more likely to have thought about things other than the appearance of the shapes while doing the experiment. However, when the team looked at the participants’ reaction times, this group didn’t do any worse on the voluntary-switch set of trials, and actually did <em>better</em> on trials where they were forced to suddenly change from reporting on one aspect of the image to another.</p>



<p>The team proposes that those who mind-wandered more put themselves in a &#8220;set-switching&#8221; mode, and this allowed them to respond better to shifts in task instructions. Their mind-wandering may, then, have enabled greater cognitive flexibility. According to this view, depending on the nature of the task, mind-wandering may indeed sometimes carry costs, but at other times, it can in fact be helpful.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this study had various limitations, not least that it was done on young, overwhelmingly female participants in a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/">WEIRD context</a>, which clearly restricts the generalisability of the results. Clearly, more work is needed to explore these ideas. But, the team concludes, this “first step towards highlighting the relevance of cognitive flexibility in mind wandering may help researchers towards gaining a more nuanced and holistic understanding of past findings.”</p>



<p>It could also represent a useful step towards a better understanding of the causes and impacts of mind wandering generally. Alongside the data on variations with age, some patient groups report heightened levels of mind-wandering (including people with ADHD), while others report much less (people with Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, for example.) A better understanding of mind-wandering could help with understanding aspects of these conditions, as well as the experiences of healthy people in everyday life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/headbutt-brain-damage-musk-ox-tau-dementia">Headbutts hurt the brain, even for a musk ox</a></h4>

              
                <p>Punishing headbutts damage the brains of musk oxen. That observation, made for the first time and reported May 17 in&nbsp;<em>Acta Neuropathologica</em>, suggests that a life full of bell-ringing clashes is not without consequences, even in animals built to bash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a musk ox looks like a dirty dust mop on four tiny hooves, it’s formidable. When charging, it can reach speeds up to 60 kilometers an hour before ramming its head directly into an oncoming head. People expected that musk oxen brains could withstand these merciless forces largely unscathed, “that they were magically perfect,” says Nicole Ackermans of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “No one actually checked.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>In fact, the brains of three wild musk oxen (two females and one male) showed signs of extensive damage, Ackermans and her colleagues found. The damage was similar to what’s seen in people with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cte-brain-damage-football-players-top-science-stories-2017-yir">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, a disorder known to be caused by repetitive head hits (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). In the musk ox brains, a form of a protein called tau had accumulated in patterns that suggested brain bashing was to blame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, the brains of the females, who hit heads less frequently than males, were worse off than the male’s. The male body, with its heavier skull, stronger neck muscles and forehead fat pads, may cushion the blows to the brain, the researchers suspect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results may highlight an evolutionary balancing act; the animals can endure just enough brain damage to allow them to survive and procreate. High-level brainwork may not matter much, Ackermans says. “Their day-to-day life is not super complicated.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Written by&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p>Just over a year ago, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">a new journal policy</a> requiring authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication of the work. We look forward to sharing the outcomes of the policy in a future post. Today, we explore the drivers behind this policy change, including community demand, research integrity, and the way we consume information.</p>



<h2>The importance of Open Code</h2>



<p>Like all methodological tools and documentation, researcher-generated scripts and code are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/07/methods-as-scientific-asset/">scientific assets</a> with real and lasting value to the research community. Augmenting a research article with Open Code contextualizes results and enhances understanding, supports <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115">reproducibility</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-021-03036-x">reuse</a>, and increases efficiency across the entire scientific ecosystem.</p>



<p>Researchers certainly appreciate the strength and relevance of open code. In a <a href="https://osf.io/tys8p/">recent survey</a> of computational biology researchers, 75% of respondents reported looking at code associated with articles they are reading, with 39% consulting code &lsquo;frequently&rsquo; or &lsquo;very frequently.&rsquo; When asked why they looked at code, 70% of respondents expressed a desire to improve their understanding of the study, and 48% hoped to reuse or adapt the code. Even before the introduction of the code policy in 2021, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> authors voluntarily shared code at a high rate (61% in 2020), indicating that this community not only consumes code, but also actively contributes to it.</p>



<p>Jason Papin, co-Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> nicely summarizes the sentiments among researchers in the discipline. &ldquo;Code is the life-blood of research in our field. In order to truly build on the discoveries and advances in our computational biology, we must be able to build on the work of others. Computational models that are readily accessible and shared can be probed in new ways to further drive biological insight; the implementation of newly developed methods with readily accessible code can be applied to new data sets to generate new hypotheses.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Making the decision to share code <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800">signals confidence and integrity</a> on the part of the authors, which in turn supports trust in the community. It suggests that the authors <em>want </em>their work to be scrutinized, and understood on its real merits. And that they are ready and willing to open doors for fellow researchers by enabling them to more easily reuse or adapt scripts for their own studies, helping the whole field to advance more quickly.</p>



<h2>Code as the crux of research</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009651">perspective article</a> published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, DuPree and colleagues draw a distinction between the scholarly article, which they argue functions as a kind of preview or entrypoint to the research, and the <em>real </em>scholarly work. That is, the methods researchers develop (in this case software and code), and the data they gather and analyze in order to produce a result. It&rsquo;s this data and code which forms the core of the research, the fulcrum on which everything else turns. For that reason, code not only deserves a place in the literature, it is required in order to fully understand and appreciate the scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as importantly, code shouldn&rsquo;t be flattened or diminished in order to fit within the confines of a classic research article. Instead, it&rsquo;s the joint responsibility of publishers and the scientific community to search out the most effective ways to capture and communicate different types of knowledge&mdash;whether that means rich text and linking, integrated and interactive research objects, or other tools.</p>



<p>Reflecting on DuPree et al&rsquo;s perspective, Feilim Mac Gabhann, co-Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> noted, &ldquo;the concept of integrating more complex research products into publications has been around for some time&mdash;from embedding videos in papers to interactive visualizations and runnable code&mdash;and given some recent progress in the field this seemed like a timely perspective. Particularly in relation to computational biology, which generates very shareable and interactive materials, and has a culture of sharing and open science that matches PLOS&rsquo; mission. Computational biology and computational sciences more broadly can be at the vanguard of enhancing or rethinking what a research paper can be and can include, which enhances scientific communication as well as the reach and uptake of the tools developed.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>Why now?</h2>



<p>Why is Open Code so important to researchers today? For that matter, why have methods documentation and data, in all their varied forms and formats, risen to such prominence in recent years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many reasons, of course. A growing awareness that published research may not be reproducible. The lived experience of researchers attempting to replicate results, conduct systematic reviews, or adapt methods for use in another study. Among the most intriguing relates to the increasing size and complexity of scientific investigations, and our evolving standards for burden of proof.</p>



<p>Nikola Stikov of the University of Montreal explains, &ldquo;work has gotten more collaborative, the barriers to new knowledge are higher, and in many fields, ideas are getting harder to find&hellip;so I believe the burden of proof is higher, and as a result code and data need to enter the picture.&rdquo;</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Each editor and researcher we spoke with pointed out that, when it comes to Open Code, simple linking is just the beginning of what&rsquo;s possible. From code notebooks, to repositories, to containerization, there are myriad ways to preserve, share and understand Open Code, prompting us to consider what an optimized, modern research article might look like.</p>



<p>At the same time, as popular as Open Code is in computation fields, there is still a long way to go before it becomes generally accepted best practice across the scientific landscape.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-biocrusts-reduce-global-dust-emissions-earth">Biocrusts reduce global dust emissions by 60 percent</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the unceasing battle against dust, humans possess a deep arsenal of weaponry, from microfiber cloths to feather dusters to vacuum cleaners. But new research suggests that none of that technology can compare to nature’s secret weapon — biological soil crusts.</p>



<p>These biocrusts are thin, cohesive layers of soil, glued together by dirt-dwelling organisms, that often carpet arid landscapes. Though innocuous, researchers now estimate that these rough soil skins prevent around 700 teragrams (30,000 times the mass of the Statue of Liberty) of dust from wafting into the air each year, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00942-1">reducing global dust emissions</a> by a staggering 60 percent. Unless steps are taken to preserve and restore biocrusts, which are threatened by climate change and shifts in land use, the future will be much dustier, ecologist Bettina Weber and colleagues report online May 16 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>





<p>Dry-land ecosystems, such as savannas, shrublands and deserts, may appear barren, but they’re providing this important natural service that is often overlooked, says Weber, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. These findings “really call for biocrust conservation.”</p>



<p>Biocrusts cover around <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0072-1">12 percent of the planet’s land surface</a> and are most often found in arid regions. They are constructed by communities of fungi, lichens, cyanobacteria and other microorganisms that live in the topmost millimeters of soil and produce adhesive substances that clump soil particles together. In dry-land ecosystems, biocrusts play an important role in concentrating nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen and also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-erosion-rate-us-midwest-unsustainable-usda">help prevent soil erosion</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>And since most of the world’s dust comes from dry lands, biocrusts are important for keeping dust bound to the ground. Fallen dust can carry nutrients that benefit plants, but it can also reduce water and air quality, hasten glacier melting and reduce river flows. For instance in the Upper Colorado River Basin, researchers found that dust not only decreased snow’s ability to reflect sunlight, but it also shortened the duration of snow cover by weeks, reducing flows of meltwater into the Colorado River by 5 percent. <a>That’s more water than the city of Las Vegas draws in a year</a>, says Matthew Bowker, an ecologist from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Experiments had already demonstrated that biocrusts strengthened soils against erosion, but Weber and her colleagues were curious how that effect played out on a global scale. So they pulled data from experimental studies that measured wind velocities needed to erode dust from various soil types and calculated how differences in biocrust coverage affected dust generation. They found that the wind velocities needed to erode dust from soils completely shielded by biocrusts were on average 4.8 times greater than the wind velocities need to erode bare soils.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers then incorporated their results, along with data on global biocrust coverage, into a global climate simulation which allowed them to estimate how much dust the world’s biocrusts trapped each year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nobody has really tried to make that calculation globally before,” says Bowker. “Even if their number is off, it shows us that the real number is probably significant.”</p>



<p>Using projections of future climate conditions and data on the conditions biocrusts can tolerate, Weber and her colleagues estimated that by 2070, climate change and land-use shifts may result in biocrust losses of 25 to 40 percent, which would increase global dust emissions by 5 to 15 percent.</p>



<p>Preserving and restoring biocrusts will be key to mitigating soil erosion and dust production in the future, Bowker says. Hopefully, these results will help to whip up more discussions on the impacts of land-use changes on biocrust health, he says. “We need to have those conversations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/24/job-seekers-prefer-to-work-for-more-diverse-companies/">Job-seekers prefer to work for more diverse companies</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Diversity at work has become a bigger and bigger focus — and not just for employers. Employees are increasingly interested in the issue, with 69% of millennials and Gen Z-ers <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/pe/Documents/human-capital/2018-Millennial-Survey-Report.pdf">saying</a> they would be much more likely to work for an employer for more than five years if it had a diverse workforce.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4025383">new study</a> finds that job seekers are even willing to explore jobs with lower salaries when companies are more diverse. It finds that sharing information about diversity makes job postings more attractive to job seekers, even when pay is lower.</p>



<span id="more-46287"></span>



<p>To conduct the study, the team partnered with an online job listings platform which emails postings relevant to individuals and their job search criteria. For the course of the 11-week study, the platform emailed job listings to 178,862 users placed in one of two conditions. In the baseline condition, participants saw emails in the normal format, with no information on diversity; in the diversity condition, participants saw a numerical diversity score for each listing: information about the race, gender, education, and language skills of a company’s workforce compared to others in the same sector and location. Information was then gathered on whether the email was opened, and which job listings were clicked on by each user.</p>



<p>Participants in the diversity condition tended to click on job listings from companies with slightly higher diversity scores than those in the baseline condition: that is, participants seemed to be paying attention to information about diversity, and using this when deciding whether to click on the listing. And the team also found that participants were willing to look at listings with lower salaries if they came from companies with a higher diversity score.</p>



<p>In a follow-up survey, participants overall indicated that they felt a diversity score would be useful in their job search. Women and people of colour were most likely to believe this would be helpful. As for why they felt it would be helpful, 50% agreed that diversity is an important social issue and wanted to know whether a potential employer agreed; 45% believed that a score would indicate how much they would enjoy working at the company; and 37% believed it would help them assess the prospects of working for such an employer.</p>



<p>Overall, the research suggests that diversity is an important factor for those looking for employment, up to the point that some would sacrifice money in order to work somewhere with a diverse workforce. However, the team notes that click-through rate may not represent actual willingness to lose salary in exchange for diversity — it may be that participants clicked out of curiosity or, if offered two jobs, would still take the one with the higher salary. Future research could look more closely at the relationship between interest in and dedication to working for a diverse organisation and salary.</p>



<p>On the whole, though, the results suggest that diversity continues to be a priority for jobseekers. To attract the best candidates, therefore, companies could look to further disclose such statistics — something which may prompt them to make more significant efforts in making their workforces more diverse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-moon-poles-ancient-volcano-eruption-water">Ice at the moon’s poles might have come from ancient volcanoes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Four billion years ago, lava spilled onto the moon’s crust, etching the man in the moon we see today. But the volcanoes may have also left a much colder legacy: ice.</p>



<p>Two billion years of volcanic eruptions on the moon may have led to the creation of many short-lived atmospheres, which contained water vapor, a new study suggests. That <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac649c">vapor could have been transported through the atmosphere</a> before settling as ice at the poles, researchers report in the May <em>Planetary Science Journal.</em></p>





<p>Since the existence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-crash-reveals-crater-held-water">lunar ice was confirmed</a> in 2009, scientists have debated the possible origins of water on the moon, which include asteroids, comets or electrically charged atoms carried by the solar wind (<em>SN: 11/13/09</em>). Or, possibly, the water originated on the moon itself, as vapor belched by the rash of volcanic eruptions from 4 billion to 2 billion years ago.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a really interesting question how those volatiles [such as water] got there,” says Andrew Wilcoski, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “We still don&#8217;t really have a good handle on how much are there and where exactly they are.”</p>



<p>Wilcoski and his colleagues decided to start by tackling volcanism’s viability as a lunar ice source. During the heyday of lunar volcanism, eruptions happened about once every 22,000 years. Assuming that H<sub>2</sub>O constituted about a third of volcano-spit gasses — based on samples of ancient lunar magma — the researchers calculate that the eruptions released upward of 20 quadrillion kilograms of water vapor in total, or the volume of approximately 25 Lake Superiors.</p>



<p>Some of this vapor would have been lost to space, as sunlight broke down water molecules or the solar wind blew the molecules off the moon. But at the frigid poles, some could have stuck to the surface as ice.</p>



<p>For that to happen, though, the rate at which the water vapor condensed into ice would have needed to surpass the rate at which the vapor escaped the moon. The team used a computer simulation to calculate and compare these rates. The simulation accounted for factors such as surface temperature, gas pressure and the loss of some vapor to mere frost.</p>



<p>About 40 percent of the total erupted water vapor could have accumulated as ice, with most of that ice at the poles, the team found. Over billions of years, some of that ice would have converted back to vapor and escaped to space. The team’s simulation predicts the amount and distribution&nbsp;of ice that remains. And it’s no small amount: Deposits could reach hundreds of meters at their thickest point, with the south pole being about twice as icy as the north pole.</p>



<p>The results align with a long-standing assumption that ice dominates at the poles because it gets stuck in cold traps that are so cold that ice will stay frozen for billions of years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Moon ice</h3>



<p>These results from a computer simulation depict the potential present-day distribution and thickness of ice at the lunar poles following volcanic eruptions 4 billion to 2 billion years ago. The south pole (left) retains more ice because it has more cold traps than the north pole (right). The dotted lines depict longitude and latitude.</p>

<p>“There are some places at the lunar poles that are as cold as Pluto,” says planetary scientist Margaret Landis of the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Volcanically sourced water vapor traveling to the poles, though, probably depends on the presence of an atmosphere, say Landis, Wilcoski and their colleague Paul Hayne, also a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. An atmospheric transit system would have allowed water molecules to travel around the moon while also making it more difficult for them to flee into space. Each eruption triggered a new atmosphere, the new calculations indicate, which then lingered for about 2,500 years before disappearing until the next eruption some 20,000 years later.</p>



<p>This part of the story is most captivating to Parvathy Prem, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who wasn’t involved in the research. “It&#8217;s a really interesting act of imagination.… How do you create atmospheres from scratch? And why do they sometimes go away?” she says. “The polar ices are one way to find out.”</p>



<p>If lunar ice was belched out of volcanoes as water vapor, the ice may retain a memory of that long-ago time. Sulfur in the polar ice, for example, would indicate that it came from a volcano as opposed to, say, an asteroid. Future moon missions plan to drill for ice cores that could confirm the ice’s origin.</p>



<p>Looking for sulfur will be important when thinking about lunar resources. These water reserves could someday be harvested by astronauts for water or rocket fuel, the researchers say. But if all the lunar water is contaminated with sulfur, Landis says, “that&#8217;s a pretty critical thing to know if you plan on bringing a straw with you to the moon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wandering-salamanders-glide-trees">‘Wandering’ salamanders glide like skydivers from the world’s tallest trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>In one of the tallest trees on Earth, a tan, mottled salamander ventures out on a fern growing high up on the trunk. Reaching the edge, the amphibian leaps, like a skydiver exiting a plane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The salamander’s confidence, it seems, is well-earned. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00602-9">bold amphibians can expertly control their descent</a>, gliding while maintaining a skydiver’s spread-out posture, researchers report May 23 in <em>Current Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wandering salamanders (<em>Aneides vagrans</em>) are native to a strip of forest in far northwestern California. They routinely climb into the canopies of coast redwoods (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>). There — as high as 88 meters up — the amphibians inhabit mats of ferns that grow in a suspended, miniature ecosystem. Unlike many salamanders that typically spend their days in streams or bogs, some of these wanderers may spend their whole lives in the trees.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Integrative biologist Christian Brown was studying these canopy crawlers as a graduate student at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in Arcata, when he noticed they would jump from a hand or branch when perturbed.</p>



<p>Now at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Brown and his colleagues wondered if the salamanders’ arboreal ways and proclivity to leap were related, and if the small creatures could orient themselves during a fall.</p>



<p>Brown and his team captured five each of <em>A. vagrans</em>, a slightly less arboreal species (<em>A. lugubris</em>), and two ground-dwelling salamanders (<em>A. flavipunctatus</em> and <em>Ensatina eschscholtzii</em>). The researchers then put each salamander in a vertical wind tunnel to simulate falling from a tree, filming the animals’ movements with a high-speed camera.</p>



<p>In all of 45 trials, the wandering salamanders showed tight control, using their outstretched limbs and tail to maintain a stable position in the air and continually adjusting as they sailed. All these salamanders slowed their descents’ speed, what the researchers call parachuting, using their appendages at some point, and many would change course and move horizontally, or glide.</p>



<p>&#8220;We expected that maybe [the salamanders] could keep themselves upright. However, we never expected to observe parachuting or gliding,” Brown says. “They were able to slow themselves down and change directions.”</p>

<p><em>A. lugubris</em> had similar aerial dexterity to <em>A. vagrans</em> but glided less (36 percent of the trials versus 58 percent). The two ground huggers mostly flailed ineffectively in the wind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wandering salamanders’ maneuverable gliding is probably invaluable in the tops of the tall redwoods, Brown says. Rerouting midair to a fern mat or branch during an accidental fall would save the effort spent crawling back up a tree.&nbsp;Gliding might also make jumping to escape a hungry owl or carnivorous mammal a feasible option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown suspects that the salamanders may also use gliding to access better patches to live. “Maybe your fern mat&#8217;s drying out, maybe there&#8217;s no bugs. Maybe there are no mates in your fern mat, you look down — there&#8217;s another fern mat,” Brown says. “Why would you take the time to walk down the tree and waste energy, be exposed and [risk] being preyed upon, when you could take the gravity elevator?”</p>



<p>There are other arboreal salamanders in the tropics, but those don’t live nearly as high as <em>A. vagrans</em>, says Erica Baken, a macroevolutionary biologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>“It would be interesting to find out if there is a height at which [gliding] evolves,” she says.</p>



<p><em>A. vagrans</em>’ relatively flat body, long legs and big feet may allow more control in the air. Brown and his colleagues are now using computer simulations to test how body proportions could impact gliding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such body tweaks, if they do turn out to be meaningful, wouldn’t be as conspicuous as the sprawling, membraned forms seen in other animals like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-flying-snakes-stay-aloft">flying snakes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colugo-flying-lemur-mammal-southeast-asia">colugos</a> that are known for their gliding (<em>SN: 6/29/20</em>; <em>SN</em><em>: 11/20/20</em>). There may be many tree-dwelling animals with conventional body plans that have been overlooked as gliders, Brown says. “The canopy world is just starting to unfold.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-dirt-plants-farming-regolith">These are the first plants grown in moon dirt</a></h4>

              
                <p>That’s one small stem for a plant, one giant leap for plant science.</p>



<p>In a tiny, lab-grown garden, the first seeds ever sown in lunar dirt have sprouted. This small crop, planted in samples returned by Apollo missions, offers hope that astronauts could someday grow their own food on the moon.</p>



<p>But plants potted in lunar dirt <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03334-8">grew more slowly and were scrawnier</a> than others grown in volcanic material from Earth, researchers report May 12 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. That finding suggests that farming on the moon would take a lot more than a green thumb.</p>





<p>“Ah! It’s so cool!” says University of Wisconsin–Madison astrobotanist Richard Barker of the experiment.</p>



<p>“Ever since these samples came back, there’s been botanists that wanted to know what would happen if you grew plants in them,” says Barker, who wasn’t involved in the study. “But everyone knows those precious samples … are priceless, and so you can understand why [NASA was] reluctant to release them.”</p>



<p>Now, NASA’s upcoming plans to send astronauts back to the moon as part of its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">Artemis program</a> have offered a new incentive to examine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">that precious dirt</a> and explore how lunar resources could support long-term missions (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>).</p>



<p>The dirt, or regolith, that covers the moon is basically a gardener’s worst nightmare. This fine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-beam-space-moon-dust-zap-clean-up">powder of razor-sharp bits</a> is full of metallic iron, rather than the oxidized kind that is palatable to plants (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>). It’s also full of tiny glass shards forged by space rocks pelting the moon. What it is <em>not</em> full of is nitrogen, phosphorus or much else plants need to grow. So, even though scientists have gotten pretty good at coaxing plants to grow in fake moon dust made of earthly materials, no one knew whether newborn plants could put down their delicate roots in the real stuff.</p>



<p>To find out, a trio of researchers at the University of Florida in Gainesville ran experiments with thale cress (<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>). This well-studied plant is in the same family as mustards and can grow in just a tiny clod of material. That was key because the researchers had only a little bit of the moon to go around.</p>



<p>The team planted seeds in tiny pots that each held about a gram of dirt. Four pots were filled with samples returned by Apollo 11, another four with Apollo 12 samples and a final four with dirt from Apollo 17. Another 16 pots were filled with earthly volcanic material used in past experiments to mimic moon dirt. All were grown under LED lights in the lab and watered with a broth of nutrients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Nothing really compared to when we first saw the seedlings as they were sprouting in the lunar regolith,” says Anna-Lisa Paul, a plant molecular biologist. “That was a moving experience, to be able to say that we’re watching the very first terrestrial organisms to grow in extraterrestrial materials, ever. And it was amazing. Just amazing.”</p>



<p>Plants grew in all the pots of lunar dirt, but none grew as well as those cultivated in earthly material. “The healthiest ones were just smaller,” Paul says. The sickliest moon-grown plants were tiny and had purplish pigmentation — a red flag for plant stress. Plants grown in Apollo 11 samples, which had been exposed on the lunar surface the longest, were most stunted.</p>



<p>Paul and colleagues also inspected the genes in their mini alien Eden. “By seeing what kind of genes are turned on and turned off in response to a stress, that shows you what tools plants are pulling out of their metabolic toolbox to deal with that stress,” she says. All plants grown in moon dirt pulled out genetic tools typically seen in plants struggling with stress from salt, metals or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-plasma-agriculture-sustainable-farms-fertilizer">reactive oxygen species</a> (<em>SN: 9/8/21</em>).</p>



<p>Apollo 11 seedlings had the most severely stressed genetic profile, offering more evidence that regolith exposed to the lunar surface longer — and therefore littered with more impact glass and metallic iron — is more toxic to plants.</p>



<p>Future space explorers could choose the site for their lunar habitat accordingly. Perhaps lunar dirt could also be modified somehow to make it more comfortable for plants. Or plants could be genetically engineered to feel more at home in alien soil. “We can also choose plants that do better,” Paul says. “Maybe spinach plants, which are very salt-tolerant, would have no trouble growing in lunar regolith.”</p>



<p>Barker isn’t daunted by the challenges promised by this first attempt at lunar gardening. &nbsp;“There’s many, many steps and pieces of technology to be developed before humanity can really engage in lunar agriculture,” he says. “But having this particular dataset is really important for those of us that believe it’s possible and important.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsars-cosmic-rays-high-energy-universe-particles-light">Pulsars may power cosmic rays with the highest-known energies in the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>The windy and chaotic remains surrounding recently exploded stars may be launching the fastest particles in the universe.</p>



<p>Highly magnetic neutron stars known as pulsars whip up a fast and strong magnetic wind. When charged particles, specifically electrons, get caught in those turbulent conditions, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac66cf">they can be boosted to extreme energies</a>, astrophysicists report April 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. What’s more, those zippy electrons can then go on to boost some ambient light to equally extreme energies, possibly creating the very high-energy gamma-ray photons that led astronomers to detect these particle launchers in the first place.</p>





<p>“This is the first step in exploring the connection between the pulsars and the ultrahigh-energy emissions,” says astrophysicist Ke Fang of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who was not involved in this new work.</p>



<p>Last year, researchers with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, or LHAASO, in China announced the discovery of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-new-high-energy-light-gamma-glow-secrets-cosmic-rays">highest-energy gamma rays ever detected</a>, up to 1.4 quadrillion electron volts (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). That’s roughly 100 times as energetic as the highest energies achievable with the world’s premier particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. Identifying what’s causing these and other extremely high-energy gamma rays could point, literally, to the locations of cosmic rays — the zippy protons, heavier atomic nuclei and electrons that bombard Earth from locales beyond our solar system.</p>





<p>Some gamma rays are thought to originate in the same environs as cosmic rays. One way they’re produced is that cosmic rays, shortly after being launched, can slam into relatively low-energy ambient photons, boosting them to high-energy gamma rays. But the electrically charged cosmic rays are buffeted by galactic magnetic fields, which means they don’t travel in a straight line, thus complicating efforts to trace the zippy particles back to their source. Gamma rays, however, are impervious to magnetic fields, so astrophysicists can trace their unwavering paths back to their origins — and figure out where cosmic rays are created.</p>



<p>To that end, the LHAASO team traced the hundreds of gamma-ray photons that it detected to 12 spots on the sky. While the team identified one spot as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/highest-energy-photons-ever-seen-hail-crab-nebula">Crab Nebula</a>, the remnant of a supernova about 6,500 light-years from Earth, the researchers suggested that the rest could be associated with other sites of stellar explosions or even young massive star clusters (<em>SN: 6/24/19</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, astrophysicist Emma de Oña Wilhelmi and colleagues zeroed in one of those possible points of origin: pulsar wind nebulas, the clouds of turbulence and charged particles surrounding a pulsar. The researchers weren’t convinced such locales could create such high-energy particles and light, so they set out to show through calculations that pulsar wind nebulas weren’t the sources of extreme gamma rays. “But to our surprise, we saw at the very extreme conditions, you can explain all the sources [that LHAASO saw],” says de Oña Wilhelmi, of the German Electron Synchrotron in Hamburg.</p>



<p>The young pulsars at the heart of these nebulas — no more than 200,000 years old — can provide all that oomph because of their ultrastrong magnetic fields, which create a turbulent magnetic bubble called a magnetosphere.</p>



<p>Any charged particles moving in an intense magnetic field get accelerated, says de Oña Wilhelmi. That’s how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">Large Hadron Collider boosts particles</a> to extreme energies (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). A pulsar-powered accelerator, though, can boost particles to even higher energies, the team calculates. That’s because the electrons escape the pulsar’s magnetosphere and meet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01580-0">up with the material</a> and magnetic fields from the stellar explosion that created the pulsar. These magnetic fields can further accelerate the electrons to even higher energies, the team finds, and if those electrons slam into ambient photons, they can boost those particles of light to ultrahigh energies, turning them into gamma rays.</p>



<p>“Pulsars are definitely very powerful accelerators,” Fang says, with “several places where particle acceleration can happen.”</p>



<p>And that could lead to a bit of confusion. Gamma-ray telescopes have pretty fuzzy vision. For example, LHASSO can make out details only as small as about half the size of the full moon. So the gamma-ray sources that the telescope detected look like blobs or bubbles, says de Oña Wilhelmi. There could be multiple energetic sources within those blobs, unresolved to current observatories.</p>



<p>“With better angular resolution and better sensitivity, we should be able to identify what [and] where the accelerator is,” she says. A few future observatories — such as the <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">Cherenkov Telescope Array</a> and the <a href="https://www.swgo.org/SWGOWiki/doku.php">Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</a> — could help, but they’re several years out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alexander-friedmann-universes-expansion-1922-cosmology">A century ago, Alexander Friedmann envisioned the universe’s expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millennia, the universe did a pretty good job of keeping its secrets from science.</p>



<p>Ancient Greeks thought the universe was a sphere of fixed stars surrounding smaller spheres carrying planets around the central Earth. Even Copernicus, who in the 16th century correctly replaced the Earth with the sun, viewed the universe as a single solar system encased by the star-studded outer sphere.</p>



<p>But in the centuries that followed, the universe revealed some of its vastness. It contained countless stars agglomerated in huge clusters, now called galaxies.</p>





<p>Then, at the end of the 1920s, the cosmos disclosed its most closely held secret of all: It was getting bigger. Rather than static and stable, an everlasting and ever-the-same entity encompassing all of reality, the universe continually expanded. Observations of distant galaxies showed them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/death-universe-required-physical-law-may-be-avoided">flying apart from each other</a>, suggesting the current cosmos to be just the adult phase of a universe born long ago in the burst of a tiny blotch of energy.</p>



<p>It was a surprise that shook science at its foundations, undercutting philosophical preconceptions about existence and launching a new era in cosmology, the study of the universe. But even more surprising, in retrospect, is that such a deep secret had already been suspected by a mathematician whose specialty was predicting the weather.</p>





<p>A century ago this month (May 1922), Russian mathematician-meteorologist <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Friedmann/">Alexander Friedmann</a> composed a paper, based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity, that outlined multiple possible histories of the universe. One such possibility described cosmic expansion, starting from a singular point. In essence, even without considering any astronomical evidence, Friedmann had anticipated the modern Big Bang theory of the birth and evolution of the universe.</p>



<p>“The new vision of the universe opened by Friedmann,” writes Russian physicist Vladimir Soloviev <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10650">in a recent paper</a>, “has become a foundation of modern cosmology.”</p>



<p>Friedmann was not well known at the time. He had graduated in 1910 from St. Petersburg University in Russia, having studied math along with some physics. In graduate school he investigated the use of math in meteorology and atmospheric dynamics. He applied that expertise in aiding the Russian air force during World War I, using math to predict the optimum release point for dropping bombs on enemy targets.</p>



<p>After the war, Friedmann learned of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes gravity as a manifestation of the geometry of space (or more accurately, spacetime). In Einstein’s theory, mass distorts spacetime, producing spacetime “curvature,” which makes masses appear to attract each other.</p>



<p>Friedmann was especially intrigued by Einstein’s <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/433">1917 paper</a> (and a similar paper by Willem de Sitter) applying general relativity to the universe as a whole. Einstein found that his original equations allowed the universe to grow or shrink. But he considered that unthinkable, so he added a term representing a repulsive force that (he thought) would keep the size of the cosmos constant. Einstein concluded that space had a positive spatial curvature (like the surface of a ball), implying a “closed,” or finite universe.</p>



<p>Friedmann accepted the new term, called the cosmological constant, but pointed out that for various values of that constant, along with other assumptions, the universe might exhibit very different behaviors. Einstein’s static universe was a special case; the universe might also expand forever, or expand for a while, then contract to a point and then begin expanding again.</p>



<p>Friedmann’s <a href="https://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/ph563/friedmann.pdf">paper describing dynamic universes</a>, titled “On the Curvature of Space,” was accepted for publication in the prestigious <em>Zeitschrift für Physik</em> on June 29, 1922.</p>



<p>Einstein objected. He wrote a note to the journal contending that Friedmann had committed a mathematical error. But the error was Einstein’s. He later acknowledged that Friedmann’s math was correct, while still denying that it had any physical validity.</p>



<p>Friedmann insisted otherwise.</p>



<p>He was not just a pure mathematician, oblivious to the physical meanings of his symbols on paper. His in-depth appreciation of the relationship between equations and the atmosphere persuaded him that the math meant something physical. He even wrote a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-as-Space-Time/dp/1927763193/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>The World as Space and Time</em></a>) delving deeply into the connection between the math of spatial geometry and the motion of physical bodies. Physical bodies “interpret” the “geometrical world,” he declared, enabling scientists to test which of the various possible geometrical worlds humans actually inhabit. Because of the physics-math connection, he averred, “it becomes possible to determine the geometry of the geometrical world through experimental studies of the physical world.”</p>



<p>So when Friedmann derived solutions to Einstein’s equations, he translated them into the possible physical meanings for the universe. Depending on various factors, the universe could be expanding from a point, or from a finite but smaller initial state, for instance. In one case he envisioned, the universe began to expand at a decelerating rate, but then reached an inflection point, whereupon it began expanding at a faster and faster rate. At the end of the 20th century, astronomers measuring the brightness of distant supernovas concluded that the universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">had taken just such a course</a>, a shock almost as surprising as the expansion of the universe itself. But Friedmann’s math had already forecast such a possibility.</p>

<p>No doubt Friedmann’s deep appreciation for the synergy of abstract math and concrete physics prepared his mind to consider the notion that the universe could be expanding. But maybe he had some additional help. Although he was the first scientist to seriously propose an expanding universe, he wasn’t the first person. Almost 75 years before Friedmann’s paper, the poet Edgar Allan Poe had <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32037">published an essay</a> (or “prose poem”) called <em>Eureka</em>. In that essay Poe described the history of the universe as expanding from the explosion of a “primordial particle.” Poe even described the universe as growing and then contracting back to a point again, just as envisioned in one of Friedmann’s scenarios.</p>



<p>Although Poe had studied math during his brief time as a student at West Point, he had used no equations in <em>Eureka</em>, and his essay was not recognized as a contribution to science. At least not directly. It turns out, though, that Friedmann was an avid reader, and among his favorite authors were Dostoevsky and Poe. So perhaps that’s why Friedmann was more receptive to an expanding universe than other scientists of his day.</p>



<p>Today Friedmann’s math remains at the core of modern cosmological theory. “The fundamental equations he derived still provide the basis for the current cosmological theories of the Big Bang and the accelerating universe,” Israeli mathematician and historian Ari Belenkiy noted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1498">in a 2013 paper</a>. “He introduced the fundamental idea of modern cosmology — that the universe is dynamic and may evolve in different manners.”</p>



<p>Friedmann emphasized that astronomical knowledge in his day was insufficient to reveal which of the possible mathematical histories the universe has chosen. Now scientists have much more data, and have narrowed the possibilities in a way that confirms the prescience of Friedmann’s math.</p>



<p>Friedmann did not live to see the triumphs of his insights, though, or even the early evidence that the universe really does expand. He died in 1925 from typhoid fever, at the age of 37. But he died knowing that he had deciphered a secret about the universe deeper than any suspected by any scientist before him. As his wife remembered, he liked to quote a passage from Dante: “The waters I am entering, no one yet has crossed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/20/hallucinations-are-surprisingly-common-and-varied-experiences/">Hallucinations are surprisingly common and varied experiences</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many mentally well people experience hallucinations. An estimated 6 &#8211; 15% of us hear, see, feel or even smell things that aren’t real. But there has been little research into what those hallucinations are like — and how they might differ from those experienced by people with psychosis. Now Mascha M.J. Linszen at Utrecht University and her colleagues report the results of a large study of more than 10,000 people aged 14 to 88. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00229-9">The work</a>, published in <em>Schizophrenia,</em> throws up a few surprises among a host of interesting findings.</p>



<span id="more-46278"></span>



<p>The team’s online survey was open to anyone aged over 14 who could understand enough Dutch to complete the questionnaires. In total, 10,448 participants (68.9% female) took part.</p>



<p>The team’s first finding was that hallucinations were common. About 80% reported having hallucinated at least once in their lifetime. About half had hallucinated within the past month and 32% within the past week. Auditory hallucinations were most common, with about 30% of the respondents saying they had experienced them in the past month, followed by visual (21.5%), tactile (about 20%) and olfactory hallucinations (about 17%). Of course, the participants were self-selecting, and not gender-balanced, and people who had hallucinated may well have been more likely to take part. It’s also worth noting that the team did not gather medical histories, so some of the participants may have had a diagnosis of psychosis. For all these reasons, it’s not possible to extrapolate these rates to the general population. But the team’s further exploration of answers given by everyone who had experienced a hallucination within the past month did lead to some unexpected results.</p>



<p>There were “remarkably high” percentages of people reporting characteristics of hallucinations previously associated only with schizophrenia, substance abuse and some neurological disorders. For example, almost half of this group had experienced hallucinations in more than one sense. Also, a large proportion of those who reported auditory hallucinations heard music, something previously regarded as rare.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most striking finding, though, was the range of content described. People reported everything from seeing shadows to hearing children crying, and from smelling food to being slapped. There was also a big spectrum of severity — from fleeting, benign experiences to minutes-long, highly distressing hallucinations. The team argues that this finding fits with the idea that psychotic symptoms fall along a continuum, ranging from isolated, minor experiences affecting people who are mentally well to those suffered by people with psychosis. (Though it’s also worth noting that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/category/psychosis/">the continuum idea has been challenged.</a>)</p>



<p>A popular explanation for hallucinations is that, in generating these misperceptions, the brain is jumping to conclusions — it’s relying more on faster top-down predictions of what it’s perceiving than bottom-up data from the senses. According to this theory, hallucinations are more likely to happen when the quality of sense data is poor. This could be down to dim lighting, for example, for a healthy individual, or perhaps a failure of the brain to properly process sense data for someone diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p>



<p>As the researchers note, from an evolutionary perspective, fast top-down predictions are especially useful if they potentially aid survival or reproduction. “This might explain why the majority of the contents in our sample involved ‘warning signs’,” the team writes. For example: hearing threatening voices, sirens or footsteps; seeing shadows or figures approaching; feeling insects crawling; smelling fire, smoke or gas; perceiving social cues, such as telephones ringing, kids crying or names being called; feeling hands on shoulders; even smelling food.</p>



<p>To better understand the causes of various types of hallucinations, they suggest that groups of people who experience a specific type, whether they are mentally well or have a clinical diagnosis, should be studied together.</p>



<p>For now though, the findings do suggest that contrary to some portrayals, hallucinations are not rare, and are not necessarily distressing. This extends similar work which had argued that <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/hearingthevoice/">hearing voices</a>, specifically, is more common than often recognised. “Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced and less severe perspective on hallucinations and other misperceptions, which are typically depicted in a negative way and often pathologized in Western news media,” the team concludes. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caribou-gut-parasites-tundra-helminth-ecosystem">Caribou gut parasites indirectly create a greener tundra</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gut parasites in large plant eaters like caribou thrive out of sight and somewhat out of mind. But these tiny tummy tenants can have big impacts on the landscape that their hosts travel through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digestive tract parasites in caribou can reduce the amount that their hosts eat, allowing for <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117381119">more plant growth in the tundra where the animals live</a>, researchers report in the May 17 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding reveals that even nonlethal infections can have reverberating effects through ecosystems.</p>





<p>Interactions between species have long been known to ripple through ecosystems, indirectly impacting other parts of the food web. When predators eat herbivores, for example, a reduction in plant-eating mouths leads to changes in the plant community.&nbsp;This is how sea otters, for example, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-kelp-forests-california-urchin-takeover-sea-otter">encourage kelp growth</a> by feeding on herbivorous urchins (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;Anytime you have a change in species interactions that changes what the animals are doing on the landscape, it can influence their impact on the ecosystem,” says Amanda Koltz, an ecologist at Washington University in St. Louis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When parasites and pathogens kill their hosts, it can have a similar effect to predators on ecosystems. A prime example is the rinderpest virus, which in the late 19th century devastated populations of ruminants — buffalo, antelope, cattle — in sub-Saharan Africa. Once wildebeest populations in East Africa were spared further infection following the vaccination of cattle and the eradication of the virus, their exploding numbers trimmed the grass back in the Serengeti and led to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000210">other landscape changes</a>.</p>



<p>But unlike rinderpest, most infections aren’t lethal. Nonlethal parasite infections are pervasive in ruminants — plant eaters that play key roles in shaping vegetation on land. Koltz and her team wondered if changes to a ruminant’s overall health or behavior from a chronic parasitic infection could also induce changes in the surrounding plant community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers looked to caribou (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>). Using data from published studies, Koltz and her team developed a series of mathematical simulations to test how caribou survival, reproduction and feeding rate could be influenced by stomach worm (<em>Ostertagia </em>spp.) infections.</p>



<p>The scientists then calculated how these effects could alter the total mass of and population changes in the caribou, parasites and plants. The simulations predict that not only could lethal infections trigger a cascade leading to more plant mass, but also nonlethal infections had just as large an effect. Sickened caribou that ate less or experienced a drop in reproduction rate led to an increase in plant mass when compared with a scenario with no parasites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also analyzed data from 59 studies on 18 species of ruminants and their parasites, gathering information on how the parasites impact host feeding rates and body mass. The analysis found that chronic parasitic infections generally cause many types of herbivores to eat less, also reducing their body mass and fat reserves.</p>



<p>Indirect ecological ramifications from parasitic infections could be common in ruminants all over the world, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>The study “highlights that there are widespread interactions that we’re not considering in ecosystem contexts quite yet, but we should be,” Koltz says.</p>



<p>Globally, parasites face an uncertain future with fast environmental changes — like climate change and habitat loss from changes in land use — altering relationships with their hosts, potentially leading to many <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602422">parasite extinctions</a>.&nbsp;“How such changes in host-parasite interactions might disrupt the structure and functioning of ecosystems is a topic that we should be thinking about,” Koltz says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings also are “going to change how we think about what controls ecosystems,” says Oswald Schmitz, a population ecologist at Yale University who was not involved in the research. “Maybe it isn’t predators that are necessarily controlling the ecosystem, maybe the parasites are more important,” he says. “And so, what we really need to do is more research that disentangles [this].”</p>



<p>Scientists are rapidly gaining a better understanding of parasites’ ubiquity and abundance, says Joshua Grinath, an ecologist at Idaho State University in Pocatello. “Now we are challenged with understanding the roles of parasites within ecological communities and ecosystems.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ufo-science-research-uap-congress-pentagon">Why some scientists want serious research into UFOs</a></h4>

              
                <p>The U.S. defense and intelligence communities are taking unidentified flying objects, officially known as unidentified aerial phenomena, seriously. And some researchers think the scientific community should too.</p>



<p>On May 17, the U.S. Congress held its first public hearing about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/whatever-happened-ufos">these objects in decades</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/71</em>). Two Pentagon officials <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/114761?s=1&amp;r=4">described efforts to catalog and analyze sightings</a>, many by military personnel such as pilots, of the unexplained phenomena because of their potential threat to national security.</p>



<p>Scott Bray, the deputy director of naval intelligence, shared new details on a database of images and videos that now includes about 400 reports of sightings of unidentified phenomena from 2004 to 2021. While officials were able to attribute some of the sightings to artifacts of certain sensors or other mundane explanations, there were others the officials “can’t explain,” Bray said.</p>





<p>Bray stressed that nothing in the database or studied by a task force set up to investigate the sightings “would suggest it’s anything nonterrestrial in origin.”</p>





<p>Both Bray and Ronald Moultrie, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security, identified “insufficient data” as a barrier to understanding what the unidentified phenomena are. “That’s one of the challenges we have,” Moultrie said.</p>



<p>That’s something that other scientists can help with, say astrobiologists Jacob Haqq Misra and Ravi Kopparapu.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Haqq Misra, of Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle, and Kopparapu, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., to learn more about how and why. Their answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<h4>What are unidentified aerial phenomena?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> “What are they” is the billion-dollar question. We don&#8217;t know what they are, and that&#8217;s what makes them interesting.</p>



<p>Unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, is the term that the military has been using. It&#8217;s a little different from the term UFO in the sense that a phenomenon could be something that&#8217;s not necessarily a physical solid object. So UAP is maybe a more all-encompassing term.</p>



<h4>Should we scientifically study them? Why?</h4>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Yes. We conduct scientific studies of unknown phenomena all the time. This should not be any different. The most critical point to remember is that when conducting those studies, we should not let our speculations drive the conclusions. The collected data should do it.</p>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> As scientists, what we should do is study things that we don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>With UAP, there seem to be some anomalous observations that are difficult to explain. Maybe they’re a sign of something like new physics, or maybe it’s just instrumental artifacts that we don&#8217;t understand or things that birds are doing.</p>



<p>It could be anything, but any of those possibilities, anything from the most extreme to the most mundane, would teach us something.</p>



<p>So there’s the scientific curiosity. And it’s also about safety for pilots too, especially if there’s something in the sky that pilots are seeing that they consider a flight safety risk.</p>



<h4>How can we study these phenomena?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> The problem with studying UAP so far is that all of the data are held by the government. From the hearing, there does seem to be a plan to declassify some data, once it’s been vetted for possible security risks, but I’m not holding my breath for that to happen soon. It was nice to hear, though.</p>



<p>The reality is if you want to understand a particular set of data, you need to know something about the instrument that collected the data. Military instruments are probably classified for good reason, for our safety. I think we’re not going to get the kind of data from the government that we need to scientifically answer the question. Even if you had that data, from the government or commercial pilots or others, it has not been intentionally collected. These have been accidental, sporadic observations.</p>



<p>So what you would need is to set up a network of detectors all around the world. Ideally, you’d have ground-based sensors and you’d have satellite coverage. It’s not enough for someone to just see something. You need to measure a detection with multiple sensors and multiple wavelengths.</p>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Some of these are transient events. We need, for example, fast-tracking cameras and optical, infrared and radar observations to collect more data to find patterns in the events’ behaviors.</p>



<p>And we need to share such data with scientists so that independent groups can reach a consensus. This is how science progresses. There are some initiatives from academics in this direction, so that is a good sign.</p>



<h4>What are some possible next steps for the scientific community for studying them?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> There are some groups that are trying to build detectors now. Fundraising is the hardest part. [The nonprofit] <a href="https://www.uapexpedition.org/">UAPx</a> is one, and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home">Galileo Project</a> [at Harvard University] is another.<strong></strong></p>



<p>And this was underscored in the hearing, but stigma has been a big problem. It seems like the military is trying to not only streamline the reporting process but also destigmatize it. That’s important for science too. If that starts to change more in the culture, that would go a long way.</p>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> I think the scientific study of UAP should not be stigmatized. There should be open discussions, comments and constructive criticisms that can help further the study of UAP.</p>



<p>There should be discussions about how and which kinds of instruments are needed to collect data. The focus should be on collecting and sharing the data and <em>then</em> commenting on the topic.</p>



<h4>How did you get interested in this topic?</h4>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Over a couple of years, I read several articles either dismissing or advocating for a particular explanation regarding UAP. Then I started digging into it, and I found <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Science-in-Default-%3A-Twenty-Two-Years-of-Inadequate-McDonald/ebe88e9c34880cae3b403b504ede15ab5064f8cb">physicist James McDonald’s “Science in Default” report from 1969</a>. That one particular report about UFOs changed my perspective. It was written similar to how we write our scientific articles. That resonated with me as a scientist, and I started to think that a science investigation is the only way we can understand UAP.</p>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> I got interested in this subject because I&#8217;m an astrobiologist and other people asked me about UFOs. UFOs are not necessarily an astrobiology topic, because we don&#8217;t know what they are. But lots of people think that they&#8217;re extraterrestrials. And I felt a little silly, being an astrobiologist and having nothing to say.</p>



<p>So I went to Carl Sagan’s files, and I realized that even though he lived decades before me, there are things in his files that we&#8217;re talking about now, that are related to airborne anomalies seen by pilots.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I realized for a scientist who wants to understand what&#8217;s going on with this UFO thing, there&#8217;s a lot of noise to sift through. There&#8217;s a lot of public discourse about other topics like crop circles, alien abductions and paranormal&nbsp;stories that muddy the waters, and the more we can be clear about the specific aerial anomalies that&nbsp;we&#8217;re talking about, the more we can actually solve the problem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-coral-antibacterial-skin-care-health-infection">These dolphins may turn to corals for skin care</a></h4>

              
                <p>On her deep-sea dives, wildlife biologist Angela Ziltener of the University of Zurich often noticed Indo-Pacific bottlenosed dolphins doing something intriguing. The dolphins (<em>Tursiops aduncus</em>) would line up to take turns brushing their bodies against corals or sea sponges lining the seafloor. After more than a decade as an “adopted” member of the pod — a status that let Ziltener get up close without disturbing the animals — she and her team may have figured out why the animals behave this way: The dolphins may use corals and sea sponges as their own private pharmacies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The invertebrates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.104271">make antibacterial compounds</a> — as well as others with antioxidant or hormonal properties — that are probably released into the waters of the Northern Red Sea  when dolphins make contact, Ziltener and colleagues report May 19 in <em>iScience</em>. So the rubbing could help dolphins maintain healthy skin.</p>





<p>Ziltener captured video showing members of the pod using corals as if they were a bath brush, swimming through to rub various parts of their bodies. Oftentimes it’s a peaceful social gathering. “It’s not like they’re fighting each other for the turn,” Ziltener says. “No, they wait and then they go through.” Other times, an individual dolphin will arrive at a patch of coral on its own.</p>



<p>But the dolphins won’t buff their bodies against just any corals, Ziltener says. They’re picky, primarily rubbing up against gorgonian corals (<em>Rumphella aggregata</em>) and leather corals (<em>Sarcophyton </em>sp.), as well as a kind of sea sponge (<em>Ircinia </em>sp.).</p>



<p>Ziltener and colleagues analyzed one-centimeter slices taken from wild corals and sponges. The team identified 17 compounds overall, including 10 with antibacterial or antimicrobial activity. It’s possible that as the dolphins swim through the corals, the compounds help protect the animals from skin irritations or infections, says coauthor Gertrud Morlock, an analytical chemist at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany. &nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Indo-Pacific bottlenosed dolphins living in the Northern Red Sea rub their bodies against gorgonian corals, which contain antibacterial compounds that may help the animals maintain healthy skin.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other animals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/medicine-wild-side">including chimpanzees, can self-medicate</a> (<em>SN: 11/3/90</em>). Marine biologist Jeremy Kiszka of Florida International University in Miami says the new study convinces him that the dolphins are using corals and sea sponges for that purpose. But, he says, additional experiments are necessary to prove the link. Lab tests, for instance, could help identify the types of bacteria that the compounds might work against.</p>



<p>Ziltener agrees there’s more to be done. For instance, it’s also possible that in addition to prevention, dolphins use corals and sea sponges to treat active skin infections, she says, but the team has yet to see proof of a coral cure. Next up though, Ziltener says, is figuring out whether dolphins prefer to rub specific body parts on specific corals in such an “underwater spa.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hepatitis-cases-children-liver-adenovirus">Unexplained hepatitis cases in kids offer more questions than answers</a></h4>

              
                <p>As health officials continue their investigation of unexplained cases of liver inflammation in children, what is known is still outpaced by what isn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>At least 500 cases of hepatitis from an unknown cause have been reported in children in roughly 30 countries, according to health agencies in Europe and the United States. As of May 18, 180 cases are under review in 36 U.S. states and territories.</p>



<p>Many of the children have recovered. But some cases have been severe, with more than two dozen of the kids needing liver transplants. At least a dozen children have died, including five in the United States.</p>





<p>The illnesses have mainly been seen in children under age 5. So far, health agencies have ruled out common causes of hepatitis, while reporting that some of the children have tested positive for adenovirus. That pathogen — which infects basically everyone, usually without serious issues — is not known as a primary cause of liver damage. For some children who are positive, officials have identified the particular adenovirus: type 41.</p>



<p>But there are several reasons why pinning an adenovirus as the sole hepatitis culprit doesn’t fully add up, researchers say. Nor is it clear whether the recent cases indicate an uptick in hepatitis illnesses, or just more attention. Though the cases seem to have popped up out of nowhere, “we’ve seen similar rare severe liver disease like this in children,” says Anna Peters, a pediatric transplant hepatologist at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.</p>



<p>Most of all, it’s important for parents to remember that the cases described so far “are a rare phenomenon,” Peters says. “Parents shouldn’t panic.”</p>



<h4>Hepatitis in children</h4>



<p>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can interfere with the organ’s many functions, including filtering blood and regulating clotting. Three hepatitis viruses, called hepatitis A, B and C, are common causes of the illness in the United States. Hepatitis A is spread when infected fecal material reaches the mouth. Children can get B and C when it’s transmitted from a pregnant person to an infant. There are vaccines available for A and B but not C. An excessive dose of acetaminophen can also cause hepatitis in children.</p>



<p>The signs of hepatitis can include nausea, fatigue, a yellow tinge to skin and eyes, urine that’s darker than usual and stools that are light-colored, among other symptoms. Hepatitis that arises quickly usually resolves, whereas some cases progress more slowly and lead to liver damage over time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s rare for a child to develop sudden liver failure. An estimated <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2022/01000/North_American_Society_for_Pediatric.23.aspx">500 to 600 cases occur each year in the United States</a>, and around 30 percent of those are “indeterminate,” meaning a cause isn’t found, according to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.</p>



<p>The indeterminate category of sudden liver failure has been known for some time, Peters says, and that subset of cases has similarities to the hepatitis under investigation. There hasn’t been data reported yet on whether the recent cases represent an increase over what’s been seen in prior years, Peters says. “Maybe this is just increased recognition of something that’s been going on.”</p>



<h4>Adenovirus as a suspect</h4>



<p>Not all of the children with hepatitis have been positive for adenovirus, nor have they all been tested. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, or ECDC, has reported <a href="https://cdn.ecdc.europa.eu/novhep-surveillance/">that of 151 cases tested, 90 were positive</a>, or 60 percent. The last dispatch from the U.K. Health Security Agency, from early May, noted that 126 samples out of 163 had been tested, with 91, or 72 percent, positive. Further analysis of 18 cases <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1073704/acute-hepatitis-technical-briefing-2.pdf">identified adenovirus type 41</a>.</p>



<p>Adenoviruses commonly infect people, typically causing colds, bronchitis or other respiratory illnesses. Two types, adenovirus 40 and 41, target the intestines, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea.</p>



<p>“All of these types, including this prime suspect type 41, have been detected everywhere continuously,” says virologist Adriana Kajon of the Lovelace Biomedical Research Institute in Albuquerque. “All of them have existed and have been reported continuously for decades.”</p>



<p>People usually recover from an adenovirus infection. The exception is those whose immune systems aren’t functioning properly — then, an infection can be serious. There have been cases of hepatitis from adenovirus in immunocompromised children, but the kids under investigation are not immunocompromised.</p>



<p>There are several curious details about the adenovirus findings. For example, the children who have tested positive for the virus had low levels in their blood. In cases of hepatitis from adenovirus, “the virus levels are very, very high,” Peters says.</p>



<p>Nor has adenovirus been found in the liver. In a study of nine children with the hepatitis in Alabama who were positive for adenovirus in blood samples, researchers studied liver tissue from six of the kids. There was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7118e1.htm">no sign of the virus in the liver</a>, the researchers report May 6 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s very hard to implicate a virus that you cannot find in the crime scene,” Kajon said May 3 at a symposium for clinical virology in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>



<p>Another oddity: There doesn’t seem to be a path of viral spread from one location to another. That’s unlike SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, “where there was quite clearly a spread from some epicenter originally,” says virologist and clinician Andrew Tai of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, who treats patients with liver disease.</p>



<p>An adenovirus culprit is not out of the realm of possibility, but “virus associations with diseases are always hard to really nail down and prove,” says virologist Katherine Spindler, also of the University of Michigan Medical School. “We’re going to be hard pressed to say this is due to adenovirus 41, let alone adenovirus.”</p>



<h4>Considering COVID-19</h4>



<p>Looming over all of this is the possibility that a many-magnitudes-larger infectious disease outbreak, COVID-19, could have a part.</p>



<p>Researchers have found that SARS-CoV-2 impacts the liver in milder and more severe cases of COVID-19. There is evidence that the liver becomes inflamed in children and adults during an infection. Liver failure can occur with a severe bout of COVID-19. And children who develop <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7655704/">multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, after COVID-19 can have hepatitis</a> as part of that syndrome.</p>



<p>Peters and her colleagues have described yet another way SARS-CoV-2 could put the liver at risk. The team reported the case of a young female patient from the fall of 2020, who had sudden liver failure about three weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. She did not have MIS-C. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9052356/">liver biopsy showed signs of autoimmune hepatitis</a>, a type in which the body attacks its own liver, Peters and colleagues report in the May <em>Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition Reports</em>. The patient recovered after treatment with anti-inflammatory medication.</p>



<p>Some of the children with hepatitis have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but more haven’t. The ECDC has reported that 20 of 173 cases tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the U.K. Health Security Agency detected the virus in 24 of 132 samples tested.</p>



<p>However, there have been very little data reported on whether the children have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, which would be evidence of a past infection. (Vaccination hasn’t been available to most of these young children.) The ECDC found that of 19 cases tested, 14 were positive for antibodies to the virus.</p>



<p>One theory is that an earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection has set the stage for an unexpected response to an adenovirus or other infection. With people no longer minimizing contact, the spread of adenoviruses and other respiratory viruses is returning to prepandemic levels.</p>



<p>“We are possibly seeing the return of these forgotten pathogens, so to speak, aggravating disease or eliciting severe inflammation resulting from some kind of preexisting condition,” which could be COVID-19, Kajon said on May 3.</p>



<p>“I cannot think of anything else that has had a worldwide impact that can explain cases of hepatitis in places as distant as the U.K. and Argentina,&#8221; Kajon says.</p>



<p>With SARS-CoV-2, researchers have a good sense of how it causes disease during an active infection, Peters says. But for the longer-term effects, “everybody is still sorting things out.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh will talk about his paper
accepted for IJCNN (International Joint Conference for Neural Network)
&quot;Sentiment Analysis Using BLSTM-ResNet on Textual Images&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sentiment Analysis is a popular classification problem where the degree of
emotion is analysed based on text. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are part
of various sentiment classification models, but their use has been limited to
one-dimensional (1D) convolution or shallow two-dimensional (2D) convolution.
The primary focus of this research is to use deep 2D-CNN architectures,
inspired by the popular computer vision model ResNet, to replace a shallow
2D-CNN in an existing BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)-2DCNN model.
This research investigates a new method for sentiment analysis which is an
amalgam of the practices popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well
as Computer Vision, striving to extract opinions from a text by transforming
text into images. The text images are formed by transforming the word
embeddings matrix into a greyscale image with the help of BLSTM cell. Intensive
experiments have been conducted on the Sentiment140 dataset with our novel
BLSTM-ResNet model, which contains residual blocks with skip connections.
Several BLSTM-ResNet variants were tested to investigate the impact of network
depth and dataset size on sentiment detection. Moreover, two sets of residual
blocks are designed to form our shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models. Our best
shallow BLSTM-ResNet models have achieved 4.06% and 3.43% increases in
accuracy for dataset sizes 80,000 and 200,000 respectively, compared with the
baseline BLSTM-2DCNN model. In addition, an overall improvement is observed on
accuracy with every additional residual block in our shallow BLSTM-ResNet model
until accuracy saturates, and the same trend has been seen on the impact of
dataset size on the performance. Our deep BLSTM-ResNet models show the same
positive impact of network depth impact and dataset size on sentiment analysis.
Further investigation on the shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models shows that
deep BLSTM-ResNet outperforms shallow BLSTM-ResNet, in general.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pipe-organs-violate-rule-sound-physics-vortex-vibration-air">Here’s why pipe organs seem to violate a rule of sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>A speck of gold dancing to a pipe organ’s tune has helped solve a long-standing mystery: why certain wind instruments violate a mathematical formula that should describe their sound.<br><br>In 1860, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/classics-science-helmholtz-harmonizing-music">physicist Hermann von Helmholtz</a> — famous for his law of the conservation of energy — devised an equation relating the wavelength of a pipe’s fundamental tone (the lowest frequency at which it resonates) to pipe length (<em>SN: 3/31/28</em>). Generally, the longer a pipe is, the lower its fundamental tone will be.</p>



<p>But the equation doesn’t work in practice. A pipe’s fundamental tone always sounds lower than the pipe’s length suggests it should according to Helmholtz’s formula. Fixing this problem requires adding an “end correction” to the equation. In the case of open-ended pipes such as flutes and those of organs, the end correction is 0.6 times the radius of the pipe. Why this was, nobody could figure out.<br><br>A break in the case came in 2010. Instrument builder and restorer Bernhardt Edskes of Wohlen, Switzerland was tuning an organ when he spotted a piece of gold that had come loose from a pipe’s gilded lip. Air pumping through the pipe should have carried away the gold. Instead, it seemed to be trapped in a vortex just above the pipe’s upper rim.</p>



<p>Edskes told his friend, physicist Leo van Hemmen of the Technical University of Munich, about the observation. Together with colleagues from Munich and Wageningen University in the Netherlands, they studied how air moves through playing organ pipes using cigarette smoke.</p>



<p>When an organ pipe sounds, a vortex indeed forms over the pipe’s rim, the team reported March 14 in Chicago at a meeting of the American Physical Society. What&#8217;s more, this vortex is <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/D09.2">capped by a hemisphere of resonating air</a>.</p>

<p>This vibrating air cap, van Hemmen says, is the long-sought explanation for the “end correction.” The cap effectively lengthens the organ pipe by the exact amount that must be tacked on to Helmholtz’s formula to explain the pipe’s fundamental tone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-dark-matter-dwarf-galaxies-physics-space">A galactic smashup might explain galaxies without dark matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two mysterious galaxies, devoid of dark matter, could have a smashing origin story.</p>



<p>About 8 billion years ago, researchers propose, two dwarf galaxies slammed into one another. That cosmic crash caused the gas within those two galaxies to split up and form multiple new dwarf galaxies, including the two dark matter–free ones.</p>



<p>A newfound <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04665-6">row of dwarf galaxies</a>, more than 6 million light-years long, could have formed in the aftermath of the hypothesized crash, researchers report in the May 19 <em>Nature.</em> If correct, the finding could help solve the mystery of how such unusual dark matter–free galaxies form, and reveal new details about the nature of dark matter.</p>





<p>But other scientists are skeptical that there’s enough evidence to support this backstory. “If this is true, I think it would be really exciting. I just don’t think the bar has been met,” says astronomer Michelle Collins of the University of Surrey in Guildford, England.</p>



<p>In 2018, Yale University astronomer Pieter van Dokkum and colleagues reported a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-mia-strange-galaxy">dwarf galaxy with no dark matter</a> (<em>SN: 3/28/18</em>). The invisible, mysterious substance is typically detectable in galaxies via its gravitational effects on stars. When a second dark matter–free dwarf galaxy was found in the vicinity in 2019, it raised an obvious question: How did the two oddball galaxies form? Dark matter is generally thought to form the foundation of all galaxies, gravitationally attracting the gas that eventually forms stars. So some process must have separated the dark matter from the galaxies’ gas.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously seen dark matter and normal matter separate on a very large scale in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enlightened-dark-matter-spotted-after-cosmic-crash">Bullet Cluster</a>, which formed when two clusters of galaxies rammed into one another (<em>SN: 8/23/06</em>). Other researchers had proposed that something similar might happen with colliding dwarf galaxies, what van Dokkum and colleagues call “bullet dwarfs.”</p>



<p>In such a collision, the dwarf galaxies’ ethereal dark matter would continue on unperturbed, because the dark matter doesn’t interact with other matter. But the gas from the two galaxies would slam together, eventually forming multiple clumps that would each become its own galaxy, free of dark matter.</p>



<p>Now, van Dokkum and colleagues say that the bullet dwarf idea explains the two previously reported dark matter–free galaxies — and several other galaxies nearby. The two galaxies are moving away from each other as if they had come from the same spot, the researchers say. What’s more, the two galaxies are part of a chain of 11 galaxies aligned in a row, a structure that could have formed in the aftermath of a bullet dwarf collision.</p>

<p>“It’s super satisfying to finally have an explanation for these weird objects,” van Dokkum says.</p>



<p>But, Collins says, “there could be much more done to make it convincing.” For example, she says, the scientists didn’t measure the distances of all the galaxies from Earth. That means some of the galaxies could be much farther away than others, and it could be a coincidence that the galaxies appear to be lined up from our viewpoint. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the researchers haven’t yet measured the velocities of all the galaxies in the trail or determined whether those galaxies are also missing their dark matter, which would help confirm whether the scenario is correct.</p>



<p>Other scientists are more optimistic. “The origin story is very plausible in my opinion,” says astrophysicist Eun-jin Shin of Seoul National University in South Korea. Shin cowrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01298-7">a perspective article on the discovery</a> with astrophysicist Ji-hoon Kim, also of Seoul National University, that was also published in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Computer simulations performed by Shin, Kim and others have shown that bullet dwarfs can produce such dark matter–free galaxies. If confirmed, the bullet dwarf idea could help pin down dark matter’s properties, in particular whether dark matter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-isnt-interacting-itself-after-all">interacts with itself</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/18</em>).</p>



<p>Van Dokkum and colleagues are planning additional measurements that could confirm or refute the case. But so far, he says, “It has, to me, the ring of truth.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">COVID-19 has killed a million Americans. Our minds can’t comprehend that number</a></h4>

              
                <p>One million deaths. That is now roughly <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/united-states">the toll of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. And that official milestone is almost certainly an undercount. The World Health Organization’s data suggest that this country hit a million deaths early in the year.</p>



<p>Whatever the precise dates and numbers, the crisis is enormous. The disease has taken the lives of more than 6 million people worldwide. Yet our minds cannot grasp such large numbers. Instead, as we go further out on a mental number line, our intuitive understanding of quantities, or number sense, gets fuzzier. Numbers simply start to feel big. Consequently, people’s emotions do not grow stronger as crises escalate. “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/behavioural-public-policy/more-who-die-the-less-we-care-psychic-numbing-and-genocide/5C41D141244217E7E1CA4D37783E1AEF">The more who die, the less we care</a>,” psychologists Paul Slovic and Daniel Västfjäll wrote in 2014.</p>

<p>But even as our brains struggle to grasp big numbers, the modern world is awash in such figures. Demographic information, funding for infrastructure and schools, taxes and national deficits are all calculated in the millions, billions and even trillions. So, too, are the human and financial losses from global crises, including the pandemic, war, famines and climate change. We clearly have a need to conceptualize big numbers. Unfortunately, the slow drumbeat of evolution means our brains have yet to catch up with the times.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Our brains think 5 or 6 is big.</h4>



<p>Numbers start to feel big surprisingly fast, says educational neuroscientist Lindsey Hasak of Stanford University. “The brain seems to consider anything larger than five a large number.”</p>



<p>Other scientists peg that value at four. Regardless of the precise pivot from small to big, researchers agree that humans, along with fish, birds, nonhuman primates and other species, do remarkably well at identifying really, <em>really</em> small quantities. That’s because there’s no counting involved. Instead, we and other species quickly recognize these minute quantities through a process called “subitizing” — that is, we look and we immediately see how many.</p>



<p>“You see one apple, you see three apples, you would never mistake that. Many species can do this,” says cognitive scientist Rafael Núñez of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>When the numbers exceed subitizing range — about four or five for humans in most cultures — species across the biological spectrum can still compare approximate quantities, says cognitive scientist Tyler Marghetis of the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>Imagine a hungry fish eyeing two clumps of similarly sized algae. Because both of those options will make “awesome feasts,” Marghetis says, the fish doesn’t need to waste limited cognitive resources to differentiate between them. But now imagine that one clump contains 900 leaves and the other 1,200 leaves. “It would make evolutionary sense for the fish to try to make that approximate comparison,” Marghetis says.</p>





<p>Scientists call this fuzzy quantification ability an “approximate number sense.” Having the wherewithal to estimate and compare quantities gives animals a <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/6/jeb218289/237916/Neuroethology-of-number-sense-across-the-animal">survival edge</a> beyond just finding food, researchers wrote in a 2021 review in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. For example, when fish find themselves in unfamiliar environments, they consistently join the larger of two schools of fish.</p>



<p>The approximate number system falls short, however, when the quantities being compared are relatively similar, relatively large or both. Comparing two piles, one with five coins and the other with nine coins, is easy. But scale those piles up to 900,005 coins and 900,009 coins, and the task becomes impossible. The same goes for when the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 goes from 999,995 to 999,999.</p>



<h4>We can improve our number sense — to a point.</h4>



<p>The bridge between fuzzy approximation and precision math appears to be language, Núñez says.</p>



<p>Because the ability to approximate numbers is universal, every known language has words and phrases to describe inexact quantities, such as a lot, a little and a gazillion. “For example, if a boy is said to have a ‘few’ oranges and a girl ‘many’ oranges, a safe inference — without the need of exact calculations — is that the <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(17)30048-7">girl has more oranges</a> than the boy,” Núñez writes in the June 1, 2017 <em>Trends in Cognitive Science.</em></p>



<p>And most cultures have symbols or words for values in the subitizing range, but not necessarily beyond that point, Núñez says. For instance, across 193 languages in hunting and gathering communities, just 8 percent of Australian languages and 39 percent of African languages have <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lity-2012-0002/html">symbols or words beyond five</a><em>, </em>researchers reported in the 2012 <em>Linguistic Typology</em>.</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>The origin of counting beyond subitizing range, and the complex math that follows, such as algebra and calculus, remains unclear. Núñez and others suspect that cultural practices and preoccupations, such as keeping track of agricultural products and raw materials for trade, gave rise to more complex numerical abilities. As math abilities developed, people became adept at conceptualizing numbers up to 1,000 due to lived experience, says cognitive scientist David Landy. Those experiences could include getting older, traveling long distances or counting large quantities of money.</p>



<p>Regular experiences, however, rarely hit the really big number range, says Landy, a senior data scientist at Netflix in San Francisco. Most people, he says, “get no experience like that for a million.”</p>



<h4>Numbers that exceed our experience perplex us.</h4>



<p>When big numbers exceed our lived experiences, or move into the abstract, our minds struggle to cope. For instance, with number sense and language so deeply intertwined, those seemingly benign commas in big numbers and linguistic transitions from thousands to millions or millions to billions, can trip us up in surprising ways.</p>



<p>When Landy and his team ask participants, often undergraduates or adults recruited online, to place numbers along a number line, they find that people are very accurate at placing numbers between 1 and 1,000. They also perform well from 1 million to 900 million. But when they change the number line endpoints to, say, 1,000 and 1 billion, people <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12342">struggle at the 1 million point</a>, Landy and colleagues reported in the March 2017 <em>Cognitive Science</em>.</p>



<p>“Half the people are putting 1 million closer to 500 million than 1,000,” Landy says. “They just don’t know how big a million is.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>All aligned</h3>



<p>People had to place ‘1 million’ and ‘500 million’ along a number line that spanned from 1,000 to 1 billion. Roughly half the respondents correctly placed both values (top). But the other half placed both numbers too far to the right (bottom). People struggle to envision numbers beyond a million, researchers say.</p>

<p>Landy believes that as people transition from their lived experiences in the thousands to the more abstract world of 1 million, they reset their mental number lines. In other words, 1 million feels akin to one, 2 million to two and so on.</p>



<p>Changing our notations might prevent that reset, Landy says. “You might be better off writing ‘a thousand thousand’ than ‘1 million’ because that’s easier to compare to 900,000.” The British used to do this with what people in the U.S. now call a trillion, which they called a million million.</p>



<h4>Without comprehension, extreme numbers foster apathy.</h4>



<p>Our inability to grasp big numbers means that stories featuring a single victim, often a child, are more likely to grab our attention than a massive crisis — a phenomenon known as the identifiable victim effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, on September 2, 2015, Aylan Kurdi, a 2-year-old refugee of the Syrian Civil War, was on a boat with his family crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Conservative estimates at the time put the war’s death toll at around 250,000 people. Kurdi’s family was trying to escape, but when their overcrowded boat capsized, the boy drowned, along with his brother and mother. The next day a picture of the infant lying dead on a Turkish beach hit the front pages of newspapers around the world.</p>



<p>No death up until that point had elicited public outcry. That photograph of a single innocent victim, however, proved a catalyst for action. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613977114">Charitable contributions</a> to the Swedish Red Cross, which had created a fund for Syrian refugees in August 2015, skyrocketed. In the week leading up to the photo’s appearance, daily donations averaged 30,000 Swedish krona, or roughly $3,000 today; in the week after the photo appeared, daily donations averaged 2 million Swedish krona, or roughly $198,500. Paul Slovic, of the University of Oregon, Eugene, Daniel Västfjäll, of Linköping University, Sweden, and colleagues reported those results in 2017 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>

<p>Earlier research shows that charitable giving, essentially a proxy for compassion, decreases even when the number of victims goes from one to two. The flip side, however, is that psychologists and others can use humans’ tendency to latch onto iconic victims to reframe large tragedies, says Deborah Small, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>Some research suggests that this power of one need not focus on a single individual. For instance, when people were asked to make hypothetical donations to save 200,000 birds or a flock of 200,000 birds, people gave <a href="https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1007181">more money to the flock</a> than the individual birds, researchers reported in the 2011 <em>E-European Advances in Consumer Research.</em></p>



<p>Framing the current tragedy in terms of a single unit likewise makes sense, Västfjäll says. Many people react differently, he says, to hearing ‘1 million U.S. citizens dead of COVID’ vs. ‘1 million people, roughly the equivalent of the entire city of San José, Calif., have died from COVID.’</p>



<h4>Milestones do still matter, even if we can’t feel them.</h4>



<p>Kurdi’s photo sparked an outpouring of empathy. But six weeks after it was published, donations had dropped to prephoto levels — what Västfjäll calls “the half-life of empathy.”</p>



<p>That fade to apathy over time exemplifies a phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation, or humans’ ability to eventually adjust to any situation, no matter how dire. We see this adaptation with the pandemic, Small says. A virus that seemed terrifying in March 2020 now exists in the background. In the United States, masks have come off and people are again going out to dinner and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-norms-covid-masks-risk-conformity-normal">attending large social events</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/22</em>).</p>



<p>One of the things that can penetrate this apathy, however, is humans’ tendency to latch onto milestones — like 1 million dead from COVID-19, Landy says. “We have lots of experience&nbsp;with small quantities&nbsp;carrying&nbsp;emotional impact. They are meaningful in our lives. But in order to think about big numbers, we have to go to a more milestone frame of mind.” That’s because our minds have not caught up to this moment in time where big numbers are everywhere.</p>



<p>And even if we cannot feel that 1 million milestone, or mourn the more than 6 million dead worldwide, the fact that we even have the language for numbers beyond just 4 or 5 is a feat of human imagination, Marghetis says. “Maybe we are not having an emotional response to [that number], but at least we can call it out. That’s an amazing power that language gives us.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Adjusting to parenting can be difficult for many new parents — particularly when it comes to judging their own competence or knowing whether or not they are doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing. Subsequently, many new parents seek advice: from peers, family members, friends, and, increasingly, from social media.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001081?dgcid=rss_sd_all#!">new study</a>, published in <em>Acta Psychologica,</em> explores the impact of parenting-related Instagram accounts on mothers. It finds a mixed experience: while mothers can feel supported by a community of fellow parents, they can also feel less competent when comparing themselves to others.</p>



<span id="more-46236"></span>



<p>Ida Egmose from the University of Copenhagen and colleagues recruited 270 mothers of one or more children. After completing demographic measures, the mothers were asked how much time, on average, they had spent on Instagram every day during the last week. Next, they indicated what sort of accounts they followed: &#8220;InstaParents&#8221; — that is, influencers who post about their experiences with parenting; professional accounts that share information about child development or parenting; or a university-run account about child development. If they did follow such accounts, they were asked how much they felt their posts negatively affected their feelings about their parental competence, and how much they felt supported by them. They also gave examples of how they felt negatively affected or supported. Finally, mothers indicated how much they compared themselves to parents they followed on Instagram.</p>



<p>The results showed that mothers frequently followed accounts that discussed parenting: 84.8% followed InstaParents and 90% followed the professional profiles. They spent, on average, nearly an hour a day on the platform.</p>



<p>On average, 84.2% felt supported by the different kinds of profiles, and they felt most supported by the professional accounts. Yet there were also those who felt that following the profiles negatively affected them: 40.7% felt this way about the InstaParents accounts and 37.1% about the professional profiles. Those who felt a higher degree of social comparison were more likely to be negatively affected by each kind of profile, but also felt more supported by InstaParents profiles.</p>



<p>In response to the open-ended questions, some wrote that they felt the accounts decreased their sense of competence, and made them worried that they were “not doing a good enough job if [they didn’t] follow all the advice” they saw. Others worried more about child development, while some pointed out that parents on Instagram can “make it all look a little too perfect”. Positive themes included the sharing of parenting tips, increased knowledge about child development, reassurance, and a sense of wider community.</p>



<p>Overall, then, mothers seemed to have a mixed experience on Instagram. Though there was certainly a level of support, negative feelings, such as concerns about not being a good enough parent, also emerged, particularly among those prone to social comparison. Instagram thus offers a potential space for learning and knowledge dissemination — but can be a double-edged sword.</p>



<p>The study only looked at mothers — looking at fathers and the impact social media has on their feelings around parenting could also be interesting. The participants were also primarily white: images of mainly white parenting influencers may have a different impact on parents of colour, which is also worth exploring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/denisovan-girl-fossil-tooth-hominid-laos-anthropology">A Denisovan girl’s fossil tooth may have been unearthed in Laos</a></h4>

              
                <p>A molar tooth from Southeast Asia probably belonged to a member of a cryptic group of Stone Age hominids called Denisovans, researchers say.</p>



<p>If so, this relatively large tooth joins only a handful of fossils from Denisovans, who are known from ancient DNA pegging them as close Neandertal relatives.</p>



<p>Analyses of the tooth’s internal structure and protein makeup indicate that the molar came from a girl in the <em>Homo</em> genus. She died between the ages of 3½ and 8½, paleoanthropologist Fabrice Demeter of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues say.</p>





<p>A Denisovan molar that dates to at least 160,000 years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir">was previously found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29923-z">newly discovered tooth</a> strongly resembles that other molar, indicating that the new find is probably Denisovan too, the team reports May 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Before the Tibetan Plateau tooth, all known fossils from the mysterious hominids had been found in Siberia.</p>



<p>Estimated ages of sediment and fossil animal bones in Tam Ngu Hao 2, or Cobra Cave, in Laos place the tooth found there between 164,000 and 131,000 years old.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the Cobra Cave tooth represents a Neandertal or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-first-known-child-neandertal-and-denisovan">someone with Denisovan and Neandertal ancestry</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/18</em>), Demeter says. His group hopes to extract DNA from the fossil, which could clarify its evolutionary status.</p>



<p>It now appears that at least five <em>Homo</em> species, including Denisovans, inhabited Southeast Asia between roughly 150,000 and 40,000 years ago, Demeter says. Others include <em>Homo sapiens</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>Homo erectus</em></a> (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines"><em>Homo luzonensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought"><em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>), also known as hobbits, he contends.</p>



<p>Still, some researchers regard Denisovans as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">one of several closely related, ancient <em>Homo</em> populations</a> rather than a distinct species (<em>SN: 6/25/21</em>). Whatever evolutionary ID Denisovans actually held, the Cobra Cave tooth adds to suspicions that the hominids inhabited Southeast Asia’s tropical forests as well as Central Asia’s cold mountain ranges and Siberia.</p>

<p>In my opinion, patient education plays a vital role in planning for dialysis options in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).  It involves more than just having a 5-minute discussion during an office visit or providing patients with handouts.  It requires an in-depth discussion about what the different dialysis options are, how patients can manage their symptoms, what patients can do to improve their outcomes, and how they can be engaged in their healthcare.  Patients who are progressing to ESKD and looking at dialysis or conservative care are vulnerable to numerous complications of their disease and poor outcomes can occur.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-022-02800-z"> Wang’s article</a>, they examine the impact of a MDPC on the risks of post-dialysis peritonitis, technique failure and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.  The MDPC team consisted of nephrologists, dietitians and nurses.  They provided standardized pre-dialysis education according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.07.015">Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines</a>.  They did not demonstrate any significance between the MDPC group and non-MDPC group in rates for development of the first episode of peritonitis, technique failure, or mortality.  But PD patients with diabetes, who received MDPC, were found to have a lower risk of mortality.</p>
<p>The impact of pre-dialysis education has been studied by other groups.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01860-9">Chou et al.</a> found that pre-ESKD care education for those with CKD stage G3-5 was associated with improved patient outcomes, including the incidence of hemodialysis and hospitalization events and a higher overall survival rate.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.02.334">Koch-Weser et al.</a> examined multiple patient education practices on content and accessibility or whether they support shared-decision making for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.  The study highlighted the great variability in education delivery, follow-up, and outcomes reported.  Additionally, the education programs were not consistently following best practices related to health literacy or supporting shared-decision making.</p>
<p>Nephrology guidelines, such as Kidney Disease:  Improving Global Outcomes (<a href="https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO_2012_CKD_GL.pdf">KDIGO</a>) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), recommend education for patients but there is no guidance on the format or structure of how to provide this education.  There is probably not a single optimal format and providers will need to gauge the learning styles of patients and tailor programs.  The study by Wang et al. brings up two areas that are worth studying further.  First, the long-term impact of pre-dialysis education on mortality benefits continued post-dialysis initiation.  Second, those factors specifically related to the dialysis procedure may not be retained long-term and perhaps ensuring there is a multidisciplinary approach to training would be important to reinforce this additional knowledge.</p>
<p>As long as education is provided to patients, I do not believe there is a specific format needed.   A program should offer many forms of education since adult patients have different learning styles.  Furthermore, ensuring that the same level of education is provided not only in pre-dialysis education but also once a patient has started dialysis.</p>
<p>What are you doing to educate your patients?</p>

<p>It was a privilege to attend PAS 2022 this year. It was invaluable to be able to connect with our community face to face and meet our esteemed</p>
<p>Editorial Board Members throughout the weekend. The caliber of research presented was truly staggering and I was very pleased to see and meet several of our authors whom presented their work at PAS. A personal highlight was listening to our author Prof. Samir Gupta present his latest Randomized Clinical Trial for which their Study Protocol was published with us at BMC Pediatrics entitled “<a class="is-external" href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02558-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after Selective early treatment for Closure of patent ductus ARteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial</a>&#8220;. It is well known that randomized clinical trials in any field are notoriously difficult to plan, fund and conduct and so it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to consider their excellent study protocol at the journal and hear about their subsequent results at PAS 2022.</p>

<p><em>“Contribution of Immature Control to the respiratory morbidity of Preemies was one of the highlights of PAS 2022 that deserves to be commented on.  </em></p>
<p><em>In the last years the incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has been progressively high, and it may be due in part to immature ventilatory control, contributing to hypoxemia. The Prematurity Related Ventilatory Control (PreVent Study) aim to elucidate individualized cardiopulmonary phenotypes and mechanisms of ventilatory control contributing to adverse respiratory outcomes in premature infants using different biomarkers to predict respiratory outcomes: Physiologic providing results from the PreVent Study focused on the natural history of disordered respiratory control in preterms  and long term morbidities; clinical characterizing the relationship between apnea, bradycardia and hypoxemic episodes as predictive parameters for later respiratory morbidities in this cohort study. The longitudinal disease burden to that time point were: 7, 14, 28 days and 32 wPMA. IH (desaturation threshold Sp02 &lt; 90%; IH &lt;90) average duration of each episode is a major physiologic predictor at all evaluated time points; AUC of 0.74 at day 7; increasing to 0.81 by day 28 and 0.84 by 32SW PMA. So, respiratory morbidity in former premies is not just BPD and clinical and physiological parameters, as periodic breathing, desaturations episodes, bradycardia, apnea, are early predictors. Clinicians need to pay attention to bedside data: Continuous ECG, heart rate, respiratory, and oxygen saturation.”</em></p>

<p><em>“The highlight for me during the recently concluded PAS 2022 meetings was a workshop entitled: Critical Race Theory in Medicine: Origins, Applications, &amp; Future Translation to Education, Clinical Practice, &amp; Research</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop was eye-opening and highly informative. I learnt how the incorporation of critical race theory – a framework for enhanced understanding of the origin of, and processes that, propagate racism, injustice, and inequities in society – into the realm of medical education would be a profoundly robust and immutable boon to efforts to address the causes of health inequities, racism, and injustice in medicine.</em></p>
<p><em>It was great to learn how critical race theory could address the shortcomings observed in the time-honored biomedical and social determinants of health models currently used to explain the aforementioned deeply rooted problems of racial disparities in healthcare delivery and outcomes.”</em></p>

His conference was an excellent argument for the benefits of Evidence Based Medicine and the importance of optimal methodologic design of clinical trials.

Also, the emotional ending of Dr Kirpalani’s conference is an eloquent sign that advances in knowledge are never made by one individual alone, but rather, they are the result of building strong relationships throughout our professional life.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-norms-covid-masks-risk-conformity-normal">Pressure to conform to social norms may explain risky COVID-19 decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pandemic has entered a murky stage, and social norms are quickly shifting, something I’ve thought a lot about lately. Many people are testing at home, or not at all. Here in Vermont, where I live, you can pick up a type of PCR test that can be taken at home. But state officials both here and elsewhere are no longer carefully monitoring the results of these tests, which means that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">actual spread of&nbsp;coronavirus</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. population remains unclear (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a few weeks, rumors of a stealth COVID-19 wave have been circulating both in the media and on my Twitter feed. Now cases and hospitalizations are rising, as are the levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://biobot.io/data">coronavirus&nbsp;in wastewater</a>.&nbsp;That suggests that more cases, and ultimately deaths, could follow.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Even with rising caseloads and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker">vaccination rate that has flatlined</a>&nbsp;at about 66 percent of the eligible population, the American public has largely begun to move on from the COVID-19 crisis. People are shedding their masks, eating out, attending concerts, traveling to far-flung locations, having large, indoor weddings and doing all the social things that people tend to do when left to their own devices.<br><br>The 2,600-person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/05/covid-white-house-correspondents-dinner-guests-positive/">White House Correspondents’ Association dinner</a>&nbsp;late last month is a case in point. Just as host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfnHU9i38E">Trevor Noah prophesied</a>,&nbsp;many of those in attendance have since tested positive for COVID-19, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and reporters from NBC, ABC, the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post,&nbsp;</em>Politico and other media outlets. And those who almost certainly knew better — cue White House&nbsp;Coronavirus&nbsp;Response Coordinator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/06/fauci-correspondents-dinner-covid-message-00030767?">Ashish Jha</a>&nbsp;— nonetheless made an appearance.<br><br>Myriad quirks related to human behavior undoubtedly underpin these arguably poor choices. The Decision Lab website has a list of the&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases">biases and mental shortcuts</a>&nbsp;people use to make decisions. The one that caught my eye is social norms. This particular quirk outlines what behaviors people deem appropriate in a given situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I started thinking about social norms while writing a feature on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-diet-western-norm-change-food-preferences">how to get people in the United States to eat less meat</a>&nbsp;when the practice is so, well, normal (<em>SN: 5/11/22</em>). Social norms, my research informed me, vary with the group one is hanging out with and one’s environs. “We&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/society/how-social-norms-complicate-behavioral-research">rapidly switch our perspective</a> depending on the context of the situation we find ourselves in,” writes marketing expert John Laurence on the Decision Lab site.</p>



<p>I might have found this idea of rapid switching suspect had I not recently experienced the phenomenon. My husband’s Disney-phile brother and his wife had been planning a family reunion in Disney World in Florida since the start of the pandemic. And I, a curmudgeonly sort not prone to feeling the magic, long ago agreed to go on the condition that other people do all the planning. And so it was, after multiple COVID-related postponements, that my kids, my husband and I landed in Orlando on a blisteringly hot April day.&nbsp;<br><br>Disney normal, I soon learned, bore little resemblance to Vermont normal. This was obvious immediately from people’s attire. All around me parents and kids dressed in coordinated outfits and matching Mickey Mouse ears. (Apologies to my kids — your mom missed the fashion memo.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social norms almost certainly arose to foster cohesion among our earliest ancestors, who needed solidarity to hunt large prey, share limited resources and ward off predators and enemy tribes. In-group norms also provide humans with a sense of belonging, which research suggests is vital for our overall health. A meta-analysis of more than 3.4 million people followed for an average of seven years showed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-psychological-fallout">likelihood of dying</a>&nbsp;during the study period increased by 26 percent for participants who reported feeling alone (<em>SN: 3/29/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, then, one of the strongest drivers of human behavior is to seek out belonging. At Disney, that quest means blocking out the reality that exists just outside the fiefdom. Wars, climate crises, political fighting and the like have no place within those magical walls. Nor do reminders of a global health crisis that, according to the latest World Health Organization estimates, has thus far&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic">killed nearly 15 million people</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within Disney’s walls, throngs of&nbsp;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/experience-updates/">mostly maskless tourists</a>&nbsp;packed onto iconic rides and into restaurants. When halfway through our trip, a Florida judge ruled that masks could not be mandated on public transit, nary a mask was to be seen on buses shuttling people to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. And everywhere, all the time, people seemed to be coughing, sniffling or blowing their noses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a science reporter covering COVID-19, I certainly knew that I should keep my mask on. And yet, my resolve soon faltered. My kids pointed out that no one else was masking, not even my typically rule-following relatives. Donning my mask meant confessing that I was not reveling in the sparkle and glitz and magic and making all too obvious to my beloved extended family that I did not, in fact, belong. I kept my face covering in my pocket. &nbsp;<br><br>Humans’ tendency toward conformity is not all bad. In a now classic study from the 1980s, researchers investigated how to reduce water consumption in drought-prone California. Signs at the University of California, Santa Cruz asking students to turn off the shower while soaping up led to only 6 percent compliance. So researchers recruited male students to serve as norm-setting role models. These role models would hang out in the communal shower until they heard another student come in, and then soap up with the water off. When one role model soaped with the shower off, roughly&nbsp;<a href="http://triggered.stanford.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://baywood.stanford.clockss.org/BWES/BAWOOD_BWES_12_3/UBD54Y9B61EFWUM6.pdf&amp;">half of the unwitting students</a>&nbsp;also began turning off their faucets at soaping time. Compliance&nbsp;jumped to 67 percent when two role models followed the sign.</p>



<p>But conformity can also distort how we make decisions. For instance, in the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was still new, researchers asked 23,000 people in Mexico to predict how a fictional woman named Mariana would decide whether or not to attend a birthday party. Most participants believed Mariana should not attend. But when they read a sentence suggesting her friends would attend or that others approved of the party, their predictions that&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247454">Mariana would also go</a>&nbsp;increased by 25 percent, researchers reported in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My decision to conform to Disney normal ended predictably — with a positive COVID-19 test. After weeks of coughing and sleepless nights, though, my frustration is less directed at myself than at political leaders who so blithely ignore both epidemiology and human behavior research and tell us to live like it’s 2019. It’s not. Nor is it 2020 or 2021. It’s the murky year known as 2022. And the rules of behavior that bolster our social norms — such as role models who refrain from large, indoor, unmasked gatherings, and leaders who uphold mask mandates on public transit to protect the most vulnerable — should reflect this liminal space.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>If we have strong political leanings, it’s likely that we’ll have similarly strong feelings about our opponents. We might think they’re misguided or stupid; we might consider them self-serving and selfish; or, worst of all, we may believe they’re actually evil.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221089451">new study</a> published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> explores this question: do we think our opponents are evil or just stupid? While the common understanding is that liberals see conservatives as evil and conservatives see liberals as stupid, the team finds that whatever our political affiliation, we’re more likely to see each other as unintelligent than immoral.</p>



<span id="more-46228"></span>



<p>In the first study, 481 American participants indicated where they would place themselves on a political scale running from very liberal to very conservative. They then thought about conservatives and liberals as a group, and indicated how many people in the group could be described using 12 different adjectives. Six of the adjectives were related to stupidity (e.g. illogical, unreasonable) and six to immorality (e.g. bad moral character, willing to harm others).</p>



<p>The results showed that, unsurprisingly, people were more likely to rate those with different political ideologies to their own as more unintelligent and more immoral than those with the same ideology. Ratings of unintelligence were also significantly higher than ratings of immorality, suggesting people see their opponents as stupid rather than evil. This was replicated in a second study, which took place after a midterm election in North Carolina.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants were instead asked to what extent they felt the average Democrat of Republican was stupid or evil, rating them on the same adjectives as in the previous studies. The framing of the question was therefore about identity rather than ideology. Again, participants rated members of their political ingroup as less stupid and less evil than members of their political outgroup. And again, participants rated political opponents as more stupid than evil.</p>



<p>The final study took a different tack, asking what people <em>think</em> Democrats and Republicans think of one another. Participants indicated how they believed their own ingroup sees the outgroup and vice versa, how their ingroup sees themselves, and how the outgroup sees themselves as well — regardless of their own perceptions. They then provided their own ratings of the in- and outgroup’s unintelligence and immorality.</p>



<p>Both Democrats and Republican participants believed — correctly — that Republicans would see Democrats as more stupid than evil, though they overestimated how negative their views would be. Democrats also accurately believed fellow Democrats would see Republicans as more unintelligent than immoral — but Republicans felt Democrats saw them as equally stupid and evil. Again, this group overestimated how negative Democrats saw them.</p>



<p>So, overall, the idea that liberals see conservatives as evil while conservatives see liberals as stupid did not bear out — participants of all political ideologies tended to see each other as stupid rather than evil.</p>



<p>The studies also found that we overestimate how negatively our political opponents view us. This misunderstanding, the team suggests, could provide a way of crossing divides or reducing conflict, offering some potential to reconcile with those with different ideologies by moving past assumptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">High-energy neutrinos may come from black holes ripping apart stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a star gets too close to a black hole, sparks fly. And, potentially, so do subatomic particles called neutrinos.</p>



<p>A dramatic light show results when a supermassive black hole rips apart a wayward star. Now, for the second time, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2a075Y64Ze91ba71d60a829359ac583e5abb498d8">a high-energy neutrino has been spotted</a> that may have come from one of these “tidal disruption events,” researchers report in a study accepted in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>These lightweight particles, which have no electric charge, careen across the cosmos and can be detected upon their arrival at Earth. The origins of such zippy neutrinos are a big mystery in physics. To create them, conditions must be just right to drastically accelerate charged particles, which would then produce neutrinos. Scientists have begun lining up likely candidates for cosmic particle accelerators. In 2020, researchers reported the first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-black-hole-high-energy-neutrino">neutrino linked to a tidal disruption event</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>). Other neutrinos have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">tied to active galactic nuclei</a>, bright regions at the centers of some galaxies (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>





<p>Discovered in 2019, the tidal disruption event reported in the new study stood out. “It was extraordinarily bright; it’s really one of the brightest transients ever seen,” says astroparticle physicist Marek Kowalski of Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, or DESY, in Zeuthen, Germany.</p>



<p>Transients are short-lived flares in the sky, such as tidal disruption events and exploding stars called supernovas. Further observations of the brilliant outburst revealed that it shone in infrared, X-rays and other wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Roughly a year after the flare’s discovery, the Antarctic neutrino observatory IceCube spotted a high-energy neutrino. By tracing the particle’s path backward, researchers determined that the neutrino came from the flare’s vicinity.</p>



<p>The matchup between the two events could be a coincidence. But when combined with the previous neutrino that was tied to a tidal disruption event, the case gets stronger. The probability of finding two such associations by chance is only about 0.034 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear how tidal disruption events would produce high-energy neutrinos. In one proposed scenario, a jet of particles flung away from the black hole could accelerate protons, which could interact with surrounding radiation to produce the speedy neutrinos.</p>



<p>‘We need more data … in order to say that these are real neutrino sources or not,” says astrophysicist Kohta Murase of Penn State University, a coauthor of the new study. If the link between the neutrinos and tidal disruption events is real, he’s optimistic that researchers won’t have to wait too long. “If this is the case, we will see more.”</p>



<p>But scientists don’t all agree that the flare was a tidal disruption event. Instead, it could have been an <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5ab1">especially bright type of supernova</a>, astrophysicist Irene Tamborra and colleagues suggest in the April 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>In such a supernova, it’s clear how energetic neutrinos could be produced, says Tamborra, of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. Protons accelerated by the supernova’s shock wave could collide with protons in the medium that surrounds the star, producing other particles that could decay to make neutrinos.</p>



<p>It’s only recently that observations of high-energy neutrinos and transients have improved enough to enable scientists to find potential links between the two. “It’s exciting,” Tamborra says. But as the debate over the newly detected neutrino’s origin shows, “at the same time, it’s uncovering many things that we don’t know.”</p>
