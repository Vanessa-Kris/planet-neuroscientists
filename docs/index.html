              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">What you need to know about the new omicron booster shots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Revamped COVID-19 vaccines are poised to do battle with the super-contagious omicron variant.</p>



<p>On September 1, U.S. health officials greenlit the first major update of the mRNA-based shots, reformulated to recognize both the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and the recently circulating versions of omicron. Those mRNA vaccine boosters could start going into arms within days.</p>



<p>“They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html">endorsing a vaccine advisory committee’s approval</a> of the shots.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Both Moderna and Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-booster-omicron-variant-coronavirus">created boosters</a> that contain instructions for making the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants’ spike protein as well as the original virus’ spike protein (<em>SN: 6/30/22</em>). Those two variants now account for nearly all the new cases in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use">emergency use authorization</a> for the shots August 31. The CDC action means the Pfizer booster is now OK’d for those 12 and older; Moderna’s shot is for those 18 and older.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-adapted-covid-19-booster-vaccines-recommended-approval-eu">European Medicines Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2022/09/health-canada-authorizes-first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-for-adults-18-years-and-older.html">Health Canada</a> also authorized use of an updated booster vaccine on September 1. That one, made by Moderna, contains mRNA instructions for building the original coronavirus spike protein and the spike protein from the omicron BA.1 subvariant. The United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia have already given the nod for use of that dual, or bivalent, booster.</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about the new shots:</p>



<h4>Should I get a booster shot?</h4>



<p>Probably. The CDC now recommends that all fully vaccinated people 12 and older get the bivalent shot, provided it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. “If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,” Walensky said.</p>



<p>That recommendation comes regardless of how many boosters people have already had.</p>



<p>“If you perceive this as big change … you’re right,” Evelyn Twentyman, who leads CDC’s vaccine policy unit, said September 1 during the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2022-09-01-02.html">vaccine advisory committee meeting</a>. “We want to emphasize we’re no longer looking at total number of doses,” she said. From now on, the agency hopes to transition into a more regular schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, similar to getting annual flu shots. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The original vaccines will still be used for the first two doses, but bivalent vaccines will replace the old boosters for all but 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer’s original vaccine booster is still available for that age group but bivalent vaccines may come later this year for children as young as 6 months old.</p>



<p>There was another big difference this time around: The decision to move forward with the BA.4/5 boosters was made without data from human trials. Such trials are under way, but results won’t be known until the end of the year.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In authorizing the new boosters without clinical trial data, the agencies are treating COVID-19 vaccines more like annual flu vaccines.</p>



<p>Data collected from people immunized with the BA.1 boosters and data from studies of mice inoculated with the BA.4/5 vaccine were used as evidence of the new boosters’ likely safety and effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency said in a Sept. 2 press briefing that it would <a href="https://twitter.com/EMA_News/status/1565673077412855808">also use the BA.1 booster to evaluate the new shots</a>.</p>



<h4>Why do the shots target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants?</h4>



<p>“We very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNFES1RLf1M">deliberately picked BA.4/5</a>,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines, said in a news briefing August 31.</p>



<p>Both companies have tested vaccines based on the omicron BA.1 variant in humans. But BA.1, which caused the massive surge earlier in the year, is no longer circulating in the United States. As of the week of August 21 through 27, BA.5 was projected to cause about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html&amp;fbclid=IwAR20LcCiCyoPDMoPXYAuRd9rIL3w3OxU45OEo4_pdpAGFbuwvIXdU6pfw0w#variant-proportions">89 percent of COVID-19 cases</a>, with BA.4 variants responsible for about 11 percent of cases.</p>



<p>“This gives us a variant that is most up-to-date, and most likely looks closer to something that may evolve further in the fall,” Marks said. “The more up-to-date you are, the better chance we have of [the vaccine] working for what comes afterward.”</p>



<p>All omicron subvariants share common mutations. But the shape of BA.4/5’s spike protein <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/03-COVID-Thornburg-508.pdf">looks much different to the immune system</a> than other omicron subvariants do, the CDC’s Natalie Thornburg said at the advisory committee meeting. Those differences may train immune cells to build a wider variety of antibodies that can latch onto a broad array of variants.</p>



<p>Mice inoculated with a BA.4/5 containing booster had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/06-COVID-Miller-508.pdf">fewer viruses in their lungs</a> than mice given a BA.1 boosters, Moderna’s Jacqueline Miller said at the CDC meeting. The mice make a human version of ACE2, the protein on the surface of cells that the coronavirus uses to gain entry. Mouse studies of earlier variant boosters corresponded well to levels of protection seen in human clinical trials, Miller said, so the company is hopeful that the BA.4/5 booster will provide good protection, too.</p>



<p>Bivalent vaccines perform better — raising antibody levels higher in people and animals — than ones that contain just the original spike protein or only a variant spike protein, Miller said. The spike protein that grabs onto human cells is a three-pronged claw. With the bivalent vaccine, each prong could be either an original or an omicron version. The mixed claw may expose parts of the spike to the immune system that are normally hidden, Miller suggested.</p>

<h4>Why now?</h4>



<p>Though the mouse data suggest the BA.4/5 booster will work, some of the CDC advisers said they’d be more comfortable having data from the ongoing human clinical trials before recommending the new shots. That data could be available in a couple of months, so why not wait?</p>



<p>The wait could cost lives and money, computer projections suggest. The COVID-19 scenario modeling hub, a consortium of pandemic forecasters who predict COVID-19 patterns over the next six months under varying conditions, considered what would happen in the United States if the boosters were given in September or not until November. Waiting would lead to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths</a>, the researchers projected.</p>



<p>An early fall booster campaign could <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/how-many-lives-could-fall-covid-19-booster-campaign-save-united-states">save more than $62 billion in direct medical costs</a>, an analysis from the Commonwealth Fund projects.</p>



<h4>Is it safe?</h4>



<p>Based on studies with the BA.1 bivalent booster, yes. That shot produced similar side effects to the original shots.</p>



<p>And it’s also safe to get <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/09-COVID-Hall-508.pdf">flu shots and other vaccines</a>, including ones used against monkeypox, at the same time as the COVID-19 booster. In fact, doctors should offer all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit, Elisha Hall of the CDC said.</p>



<p>Some data indicate that the chance of serious side effects, like heart inflammation called myocarditis, happen at similar or lower rates with boosters than with the second doses of the mRNA vaccines. The side effect is rare; CDC has verified <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/05-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf">131 myocarditis cases out of more than 126 million booster doses</a> given, Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Unit reported. The rate of myocarditis is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">1.8 to 5.6 times higher after a COVID-19 infection</a> than after vaccination for 12- to 17-year-old males — the group for which the condition has the highest risk, the CDC’s Sara Oliver said. &nbsp;Spacing the booster at least two months after the last dose of vaccine may help to head off any increase in myocarditis, Marks said in the FDA press briefing.</p>



<p>“We have a tremendous amount of experience with the monovalent, original vaccine,” the FDA’s Doran Fink said during the CDC advisory meeting. That experience made the FDA comfortable extrapolating data from the BA.1 booster trials to decide that the new shots are also safe. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t usually have too much clinical information … when we are thinking about changing influenza vaccines,” said Sarah Long, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. Much like the flu vaccine remodels last season’s version, the updated COVID-19 booster is built on the same scaffolding as the original version. “It’s part of the same roof. We’re just putting in some dormers and windows.”</p>



<p>Pablo Sanchez, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, cast the sole dissenting vote against recommending the BA.4/5 boosters. Other committee members voted to recommend the boosters, but they voiced reservations about those votes.</p>



<p>“I really don’t want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don’t have clinical data on,” Sanchez said. He added, “I’m comfortable that the vaccine will likely be safe like the others,” but having the human data may help counter vaccine hesitancy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamonds-laser-plastic-bottle-planets-physics">Zapping plastic with a laser forged tiny diamonds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A laser blast produces miniature diamonds from plain-old plastic. That’s right, the same kind used in soda bottles.</p>



<p>When squeezed to about a million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure and heated to thousands of degrees Celsius, polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo0617">forms nanodiamonds</a>, physicist Dominik Kraus and colleagues report September 2 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Ice giant planets, such as Neptune and Uranus, have similar temperatures, pressures and combinations of chemical elements as the materials in the study, suggesting that diamonds may rain down in those planets’ interiors. What’s more, the researchers say, the new technique could be used to manufacture nanodiamonds for use in quantum devices and other applications.</p>





<p>In the new study, researchers trained lasers on samples of plastic. Each laser blast sent a shock wave careening through the plastic, amping up the pressure and temperature within. Probing the material with bursts of X-rays revealed that nanodiamonds had formed.</p>



<p>Previous studies had created diamonds by compressing compounds of hydrogen and carbon. But PET, which is commonly used in food and drink packaging, contains not just hydrogen and carbon but also oxygen. That makes it a better match to the composition of ice giant planets like Neptune and Uranus. The oxygen seems to assist the diamond formation, says Kraus, of the University of Rostock in Germany. “The oxygen sucks out the hydrogen,” he says, leaving behind carbon which can then form diamond.</p>



<p>Nanodiamonds are commonly produced using explosives, Kraus says, a process not easy to control. The new technique could create nanodiamonds that are more easily tailored for particular uses, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/designer-diamonds-could-one-day-help-build-quantum-internet">quantum devices made using diamond with defects</a> where, for example, nitrogen atoms replace some of the carbon atoms (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>“The idea is quite cool. You take water bottle plastic; you zap it with a laser to make diamond. How practical it is, I don’t know,” says physicist Marius Millot of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the new study. How easily the diamonds could be recovered is unclear, he says. But, “it’s pretty neat to think about the idea.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruption-deadly-warning-nyiragong-congo">In 2021, a deadly volcano erupted with no warning. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>In May 2021, Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes, burst to life without warning. Lava erupted from fissures and flowed down the mountain toward cities below, leaving hundreds dead or missing and hundreds more injured.</p>



<p>Now, using data from monitoring stations installed near the volcano in 2015, researchers have pieced together <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05047-8">how that eruption happened so suddenly</a>. The data also suggest that the event could have been even deadlier — and highlight the urgent need to better understand this volcano’s particular hazards before the next eruption, volcanologist Delphine Smittarello and colleagues report in the Sept. 1 <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>“Nyiragongo is unique in that 1 million people are living just at the foot of the volcano,” says Smittarello, of the European Center for Geodynamics and Seismology in Luxembourg. The mountain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/studying-volcano-war-zone">sits near the eastern border of Congo</a>, looming over both the Congolese city of Goma, population of about 700,000, and the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, population about 83,000 (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). “There are so many people so close to a very dangerous place.”</p>



<p>Nyiragongo’s last two eruptions, in 1977 and 2002, were both presaged by days of distinct seismic rumblings strong enough to be felt by people living nearby. But before the eruption on May 22, 2021, even the sensitive monitoring stations near the volcano seemed to detect no clear warning signs of magma on the move underground.</p>



<p>There was the large lake of molten lava burbling in the volcano’s summit crater: By 2021, that lake had risen to near the top of the crater. But typically lake level alone isn’t enough to indicate an imminent eruption, Smittarello says. Levels had intermittently risen and fallen over the years since 2002 as magma moved around the volcano’s deep plumbing. And in 2021, the lake was still 85 meters below its 2002 level.</p>



<p>So Smittarello and her colleagues took another look at the monitoring stations’ seismic and acoustic data. This time, the analysis identified a rumbling of small quakes that commenced just 40 minutes before the actual eruption. Half an hour later, just 10 minutes before the lava burst through, detections of acoustic signals — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cotopaxi-volcano-ecuador-infrasound">low-frequency “infrasound” waves</a> — began to increase, a hint that the volcano was about to erupt (<em>SN: 6/25/18</em>).</p>



<p>The trigger for the actual eruption was probably a tiny rupture that formed in the volcanic cone due to the buildup of stress over time from the pressure and heat of the magma within, the researchers say. That would have been enough to allow the magma to push through.</p>



<p>The short lag time between the signals and the eruption was probably because that magma was already extremely close to the surface, the researchers suggest. “What we monitor is the magma moving, not the presence or absence of magma,” Smittarello says. Because the magma had very little distance to travel, there was also very little warning.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The eruption itself lasted about six hours, but in its aftermath, there was plenty of seismic activity lasting another 10 days, suggesting the magma was now on the move. Those data, monitored in real time, indicated something troubling — the magma was moving underground, away from the summit, snaking beneath the city of Goma and nearby Lake Kivu.</p>



<p>As the magma migrated, scientists and local citizens worked together to trace the formation of cracks in the ground, which can indicate propagating dikes, lateral pathways through which magma is moving beneath the surface. Similar lateral pathways formed during the eruption of Kilauea in Hawaii, Smittarello says. In that case, the magma <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilauea-volcano-pyrotechnics-lava-no-signs-stopping">migrated to a neighborhood</a> along the volcano’s lower east rift zone before erupting (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>Based on the possible path of the magma, Goma city officials issued evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people who were potentially in the magma’s path. Meanwhile, scientists anxiously watched for signs of a potential “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cameroons-killer-lakes-rising-threat">limnic eruption</a>” at Lake Kivu — a rare type of disaster in which a noxious cloud of dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and methane suddenly erupts from deep lakes, suffocating living creatures nearby (<em>SN: 4/2/94</em>). Gas-rich magma seeping into the lake&#8217;s bottom could have triggered such an eruption. In either case, “if [the magma] finds a path to the surface, it’s a catastrophe,” Smittarello says.</p>



<p>Neither catastrophe occurred, thankfully, Smittarello says. “It was a lucky situation. But we don’t know why.”</p>



<p>It was especially lucky given the fact that the magma was closer to the surface than thought at the time, the team reports in the new study. That means the residents above were even closer to greater disaster than had been realized.</p>



<p>Reanalysis of posteruptive seismic data let the researchers determine the actual position of the underground dikes. The team found that one dike beneath Goma was as shallow as 450 meters deep. That’s particularly surprising because such a shallow magma channel would be expected to emit a telltale cocktail of volcanic gases from the ground cracks.</p>

<h3>What lies beneath</h3>



<p>In the aftermath of Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo eruption on May 22, 2021,&nbsp; seismic data (black circles) indicated that magma was moving underground away from the volcano’s summit and toward the city of Goma and Lake Kivu. In a new study, researchers used those data to map the extent and width of the dike (widest at the reddest color). To their surprise, they found that it was as shallow as just 450 meters beneath Goma at one point and presented a serious threat.</p>

<p>It’s not unheard-of for volcanic dikes to give no gassy indicators of their presence, says geophysicist Michael Poland of the U.S. Geological Survey, who is based in Vancouver, Wash., and leads the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. The magma may have lost a lot of its gases as it circulated up into the summit lava lake; by the time it pushed into underground channels, it was potentially already degassed.</p>



<p>But that scenario is worrisome because there’s one fewer warning signal of possible danger to the communities above, says Poland, who was not involved in the new study. It also raises new questions — such as how such gas-poor magma might interact with Lake Kivu if it does flow into the lake.</p>



<p>What the 2021 eruption makes clear is that scientists need to investigate such questions to get a better understanding of the peculiarities of Nyiragongo — and to tailor monitoring and hazard warnings accordingly, Poland adds.</p>



<p>All volcanoes have their own personalities, and scientists need to develop a better appreciation for any warning signs that might exist. In this case, for example, that might include the lava lake level, he says. “The traditional approach is less reliable at Nyiragongo.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">Here’s the James Webb telescope’s first direct image of an exoplanet</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is the first picture of an exoplanet from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>“We’re actually measuring photons from the atmosphere of the planet itself,” says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. Seeing those particles of light, “to me, that’s very exciting.”</p>



<p>The planet is about seven times the mass of Jupiter and lies more than 100 times farther from its star than Earth sits from the sun, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14990">direct observations of exoplanet HIP 65426 b</a> show. It’s also young, about 10 million or 20 million years old, compared with the more than 4-billion-year-old Earth, Hinkley and colleagues report in a study submitted August 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>Those three features — size, distance and youth — made HIP 65426 b relatively easy to see, and so a good planet to test JWST’s observing abilities. And the telescope has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">once again surpassed astronomers’ expectations</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve demonstrated really how powerful JWST is as an instrument for the direct imaging of exoplanets,” says exoplanet astronomer and coauthor Aarynn Carter of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>Astronomers have found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">more than 5,000 planets orbiting other stars</a> (<em>SN: 3/22/22</em>). But almost all of those planets were detected indirectly, either by the planets tugging on the stars with their gravity or blocking starlight as they cross between the star and a telescope’s view.</p>



<p>To see a planet directly, astronomers have to block out the light from its star and let the planet’s own light shine, a tricky process. It’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">been</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planets-atmospheres-revealed">done</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-picture-sun-like-star-multiple-exoplanets-astronomy-planets">before</a>, but for only about 20 planets total (<em>SN: 11/13/08; SN: 3/14/13; SN: 7/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>“In every area of exoplanet discovery, nature has been very generous,” says MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager, who was not involved in the JWST discovery. “This is the one area where nature didn’t really come through.”</p>



<p>In 2017, astronomers discovered HIP 65426 b and took a direct image of it using an instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. But because that telescope is on the ground, it can’t see all the light coming from the exoplanet. Earth’s atmosphere absorbs a lot of the planet’s infrared wavelengths — exactly the wavelengths JWST excels at observing. The space telescope observed the planet on July 17 and July 30, capturing its glow in four different infrared wavelengths.</p>



<p>“These are wavelengths of light that we’ve never ever seen exoplanets in before,” Hinkley says. “I’ve literally been waiting for this day for six years. It feels amazing.”</p>



<p>Pictures in these wavelengths will help reveal how planets formed and what their atmospheres are made of.</p>



<p>“Direct imaging is our future,” Seager says. “It’s amazing to see the Webb performing so well.”</p>



<p>While the team has not yet studied the atmosphere of HIP 65426 b in detail, it did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620">report the first spectrum</a> — a measurement of light in a range of wavelengths — of an object orbiting a different star. The spectrum allows a deeper look into the object’s chemistry and atmosphere, astronomer Brittany Miles of UC Santa Cruz and colleagues reported September 1 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>That object is called VHS 1256 b. It’s as heavy as 20 Jupiters, so it may be more like a transition object between a planet and a star, called a brown dwarf, than a giant planet. JWST found evidence that the amounts of carbon monoxide and methane in the atmosphere of the orb are out of equilibrium. That means the atmosphere is getting mixed up, with winds or currents pulling molecules from lower depths to its top and vice versa. The telescope also saw signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brown-dwarf-sand-cloud-atmosphere-space">sand clouds</a>, a common feature in brown dwarf atmospheres (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>).</p>



<p>“This is probably a violent and turbulent atmosphere that is filled with clouds,” Hinkley says.</p>



<p>HIP 65426 b and VHS 1256 b are unlike anything we see in our solar system. They’re more than three times the distance of Uranus from their stars, which suggests they formed in a totally different way from more familiar planets. In future work, astronomers hope to use JWST to image smaller planets that sit closer to their stars.</p>



<p>“What we’d like to do is get down to study Earths, wouldn’t we? We’d really like to get that first image of an Earth orbiting another star,” Hinkley says. That’s probably out of JWST’s reach — Earth-sized planets are still too small see. But a Saturn? That may be something JWST could focus its sights on.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insulin-longevity-aging-ant-queens">A clever molecular trick extends the lives of these ant queens</a></h4>

              
                <p>For some ant queens, the secret to long life might be a self-produced insulin blocker.</p>



<p>Ant queens are famously long-lived, even though they shouldn’t be. Generally, animals that put lots of energy into reproduction sacrifice some time off their life. But ant queens produce millions of eggs and live an extraordinarily long time compared with worker ants that don’t reproduce.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have shown how one ant species pulls off this anti-aging feat. When queens and wannabe queens of the species <em>Harpegnathos saltator</em> gear up to reproduce, a part of what’s called the insulin signaling pathway <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8767">gets blocked</a>, slowing aging, the researchers report in the Sept. 2 <em>Science</em>. That molecular pathway has long been implicated in aging in mammals, including humans.</p>





<p>“There’s been a need to understand why queens, or reproductives, in social insects can live for so amazingly long,” says Marc Tatar, a biologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved with the study. Some ant species have queens that survive 30 times as long as their workers. Other social insects such as bees and termites also have long-lived queens.</p>



<p>In a rare behavior for ants, when a queen <em>H. saltator </em>dies, some female workers begin competing in duels for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/insect-queens-sterilize-workers-similar-chemical">the chance to replace her</a> (<em>SN: 1/17/14</em>). These hopeful royals develop ovaries, start laying eggs and transition into queenlike forms called gamergates. When a worker transitions to a gamergate, her life span becomes five times as long as it was. But if she doesn’t end up becoming queen and reverts back to a worker, her life span shortens again.</p>



<p>The researchers exploited this behavior to investigate the molecular underpinnings of anti-aging in these ants. <em>H. saltator </em>gamergates, it turns out, extend their life spans by taking advantage of a split in the insulin signaling pathway, the chain of chemical reactions that drive insulin’s effects on the body. One branch of this pathway is involved with reproduction, while the other is implicated in aging.</p>



<p>“Insulin comes with our life — [after] we eat, we have high insulin,” says Hua Yan, a biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “But a constant high level of insulin is bad for longevity.”</p>



<p>Examining patterns of gene activity, Yan and colleagues found that gamergates have more active insulin genes than regular worker ants and, as a result, have increased metabolic activity and ovary development. But the secret sauce protecting the ants from the insulin’s aging effects appears to be a molecule called Imp-L2, which blocks the branch of the insulin pathway linked to aging, experiments showed. The branch involved in reproduction, however, remains active.</p>



<p>“What we don’t understand is how Imp-L2 can act on one aspect of the pathway and not on the other,” says study coauthor Claude Desplan, a developmental biologist at New York University.</p>



<p>These results represent a leap forward in our understanding of extreme social insect longevity, the researchers say, while also showcasing an anti-aging evolutionary adaptation that hasn’t been seen in the wild before.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538754153">The Milky Way</a><br><em>Moiya McTier</em><br><em>Grand Central Publishing, $27</em></p>



<p>Meet the Milky Way in its own words.</p>



<p><em>The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy</em> takes a tour of our home in the cosmos from an unexpected perspective. Astrophysicist and folklorist Moiya McTier presents herself not as the author, but as the lucky human vessel through which the Milky Way has chosen to tell its story. Then she lets the galaxy take it away, with humor, heart and a huge dose of snark.</p>





<p>The book alternates chapters between science and mythology, reflecting McTier’s dual specialties (her bio says she was the first student in Harvard University’s history to study both). “Many of you don’t realize this, but myths were some of your species’ first attempt at scientific inquiry,” the Milky Way tells us.</p>



<p>The Milky Way is telling its story now because it’s sick of being ignored. Once upon a time, humans looked to the glittering smudge of stars in the sky for insight into when to plant crops or avoid floods. We told stories about the Milky Way’s importance in the origin and fate of the world.</p>



<p>Our galaxy ate it up: For an entity that spends most of its time ripping up smaller galaxies and watching its own stars die, “your stories made me feel loved and needed and, perhaps for the first time in my long existence, more helpful than I was ruinous.” But in the last few centuries, technology and light pollution have pulled humankind away. “At first, I thought it was just a phase,” the Milky Way says. “Then I remembered … that several hundred years is actually a long time for humans.”</p>





<p>So the Milky Way decided to remind us why it’s so important. Its autobiography covers big-picture scientific questions about galaxies, like where they come from (“When a gas cloud loves itself very much,” the Milky Way explains, “it hugs itself extra tight, and after a few hundred million years, a baby galaxy is born. Leave the storks out of it, please.”). It also gets into what galaxies are made of, how they interact with other galaxies, and how they live and die. The book then zooms out to cover the origins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-end-everything-explores-ways-universe-could-perish">possible ends of the universe</a>, mysteries like dark matter and dark energy, and even humankind’s search for other intelligent life (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The author takes pains to explain scientific jargon and the technical tools that astronomers use to study the sky. A lot of popular astronomy writing glosses over how astronomers think about cosmic distance or exactly what a spectrum is, but not this book. If you’ve ever been curious about these insider details, <em>The Milky Way</em> has you covered.</p>



<p>McTier’s version of our home galaxy is heavily anthropomorphized. The Milky Way is brash, vain and arrogant in a way that may hide a secret insecurity. Its central black hole is characterized as the physical embodiment of the galaxy’s shame and regrets, a source of deep existential angst. And its relationship with the Andromeda galaxy is like a long-term, long-distance romance, with each galaxy sending stars back and forth as love notes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole-collision-simulation">until the two can eventually merge</a> (<em>SN: 3/05/21</em>).</p>



<p>This could have felt gimmicky. But McTier’s efforts to make the metaphors work while keeping the science accurate and up-to-date made the premise endearing and entertaining.</p>



<p>I laughed twice on Page 1. I learned a new word on Page 2. I dog-eared the endnotes early on because it became instantly clear I would want to read every one. I read this book while traveling in rural upstate New York, where the sky is much clearer than at my home outside of Boston. <em>The Milky Way</em> reminded me to look up and appreciate my home in the universe, just like its narrator wanted. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-cheers-the-ostp-memorandum/">PLOS cheers the OSTP memorandum “Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research”</a></h4>

              
                <p>We were thrilled last Thursday to read Dr. Alondra Nelson&rsquo;s United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">memorandum</a> on the subject of &ldquo;Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vision expressed in the memo represents a tremendous step toward the future of scientific research communication that PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/about/">has been working toward</a> since our founding in 2001. It truly is a watershed moment for the US research community and everyone who has a stake in scientific communications.</p>



<p>The memo requires US federal granting bodies to develop and implement new policies making all tax-payer funded scholarly research and underlying raw data freely and publicly available without embargo by 2026. Importantly, the guidance applies to all federal agencies with R&amp;D expenditures, regardless of budget size or the subject area of the research being funded.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks and months, we will consider and expand on what this memo, and other policy advancements around the world, mean for Open Scholarship and Open Science, and how we can all play our part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, we want to confirm that <strong>publishing in any</strong> <strong>PLOS journal already meets or exceeds the requirements outlined in the OSTP memo.</strong> Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Free public access to scholarly publications</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should update or develop new public access plans for ensuring&hellip;that all peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or coauthored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally funded research </em><strong><em>are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without any embargo or delay after publication.</em></strong><em>&rdquo;</em> (emphasis in the original) p. 3</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS is and always has been a fully Open Access publisher. Everything we publish is available under a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-access/">CC BY</a> copyright license. That means the research is not only publicly accessible&mdash;it&rsquo;s also freely available for redistribution, remixing, and reuse.</p>



<p>PLOS began publishing journals precisely to provide venues that would lead this kind of transformation in science communication. You might even say <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">we were born for this</a> moment. We helped catalyze a change in scholarly publishing when we launched <em>PLOS Biology</em> in 2003. Since then, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio to include <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">12 journals</a> serving researchers in all areas of science and medicine to make all high quality and impactful research openly accessible to everyone.</p>



<h2>No delays or embargos</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><em>&ldquo;OSTP recommends that federal agencies&hellip;make publications and their supporting data resulting from federally funded research publicly accessible without an <strong>embargo on their free and public release</strong>.&rdquo; </em>(emphasis in the original) p. 1</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>At PLOS, everything we publish is freely available for anyone, anywhere in the world to read, cite, share, or iterate upon, right from the very start.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve always believed knowledge should be available to all without barriers. PLOS publishes research that meets the highest standards of methodological and ethical rigor, without restrictions, delays, or reader fees. We also support preprint-posting across each of our journals so you can make your work available as soon as you&rsquo;re ready.</p>



<h2>Machine readable</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right">&ldquo;<em>Federal agencies should aim &ldquo;to maximize equitable reach of public access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications, including by providing free online access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications in formats that allow for machine-readability.&rdquo;</em> p. 3-4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>All PLOS articles and published peer reviews are fully machine readable, indexed, and archived to enhance discoverability, and enable further parsing, cross-referencing, processing, and analysis. Plus, our entire corpus is available for download through the <a href="https://github.com/PLOS/allofplos">AllofPLOS</a> project in order to facilitate meta-analysis of the research we publish, and meta-research into publishing patterns.</p>



<h2>Public data</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Scientific data underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from federally funded research should be made freely available and publicly accessible by default at the time of publication&rdquo;</em> p. 4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>Since 2014, PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">Data Availability</a> policy has required that the raw data underlying each study we publish be made publicly available upon publication.</p>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research. Data are key for verification, replication and reanalysis, to inform future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Demonstrating that level of transparency with the research community signals integrity and inspires trust in return.</p>



<h2>Research integrity through metadata</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should take actions to ensure that these elements of scientific and research integrity are in place in order to strengthen public trust in federally funded science&hellip;The public should be able to identify which federal agencies support given investments in science, the scientists who conduct that research, and the extent to which peer-review was conducted.&rdquo;</em> p. 5-6</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS prominently displays data availability, funding, and competing interest statements on each article we publish. We use ORCID IDs to identify and distinguish individual researchers, and the CRediT classification system to describe each author&rsquo;s specific contributions to the work. DOIs and sub-DOIs make it easy to cite our articles, figures, and datasets, as well as the associated Published Peer Review History. Our partnerships, together with our archival and indexing standards enable bi-directional linking to and from each article, and its related research products on other sites, including preprints, Open Data, Open Methods, Open Code.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Moving Open Science beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Of course, we recognize a transition to OA publication comes with many other considerations for researchers who have not done so before. The features above are embedded in our journals and publishing process to make it as easy as possible for authors, and we are always working with research communities to improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, we acknowledge Article Processing Charges (APCs) pose a barrier for many researchers and we are experimenting with new business models designed to reflect the true cost of publication, and to allocate costs more fairly, making Open Access publishing accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>PLOS already has partnerships with many US institutions to make the cost of publishing free for those researchers. Check our list of <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/#us">partner institutions</a> to see if your institution has an existing agreement. We are always reaching out to new institutions to expand coverage for authors. If you don&rsquo;t see your institution here already, please fill out <a href="https://plos.org/resources/refer/">this form</a>.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/meet-the-editor-in-chief-plos-medicine/">Meet the new Editor-in-Chief of PLOS Medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are delighted to be introducing the new Editor-in-Chief of <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/?utm_id=323&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=323med0922&amp;utm_content=in_copy_link">PLOS Medicine</a></em>, Prof. Dr. Till B&auml;rnighausen! He brings with him a wealth of expertise and experience in the major drivers of good health, as well as interventions that can improve and support health at population level. He is committed to increasing the uptake of open science practices in the medical community, and advocates for more transparency in the process of research practice.</p>



<p>Till has kindly answered some of our burning questions about himself, his background, and what he plans to bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. Get to know him a little better with this short interview.</p>



<h3>What is the specific background and expertise do you bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>



<p>I originally trained as a family physician and bring research domain competence on many of the major global disease burdens &ndash; including HIV, diabetes, hypertension, and depression &ndash; to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, paired with broad methods competence for the design and evaluation of interventions and policies that address these burdens. I have research expertise and experience in multiple disciplines, such as epidemiology, data science, economics, health systems research, and design and implementation research.</p>



<h3><br>How do you align with the Executive Editor&rsquo;s expertise and interests? And can you anticipate what will be the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy you and the Executive Editor are developing?</h3>



<p>Raffaella Bosurgi (Executive Editor) and I share expertise and interests in the major biological, behavioural, social, and environmental drivers of good health, as well as the interventions and policies that can substantially boost health at the population level. I anticipate that the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy will focus thematically on the most promising solutions to the massive preventable and curable disease burdens that continue to persist and increase; in particular in the world&rsquo;s resource-poorest communities and countries. </p>



<p>Major new movements in health systems worldwide &ndash; such as healthcare in everyday places, health promotion through social networks, and digital and mobile approaches to reach resource-poor and left-behind populations &ndash; require design research to create interventions and evaluation research to establish causal impact, performance, and social and economic value.<em> PLOS Medicine</em> should strive to be the first choice for researchers to publish ground-breaking research on solutions to the world&rsquo;s largest and most pressing health problems. </p>



<p>Methodologically, I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus equally strongly on high-quality clinical evidence, such as from efficacy trials and large clinical cohorts, and on population evidence, such as from health policy experiments and quasi-experiments. Last but not least I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus on the important and complex relationships between human health and the environment and how both can thrive in respect of each other in order to build more resilient societies and futures.</p>



<h3><br>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</h3>



<p>Part of the PLOS family of journals, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has been at the forefront of the Open Science movement since its inception in 2004. As this movement advances, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has an opportunity to further broaden its &lsquo;openness&rsquo;. As Editor-in-Chief, I will work with the Executive Editor and the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> leadership team, editorial board, reviewers and authors to consider initiatives for open engagement of other societal actors in publishing scientific articles on health and medicine. For instance, the beneficiaries of findings published in the journal could be invited comment, providing novel perspectives on the value and usefulness of a particular piece. Similarly, themes for special issues could be decided in open engagement with patient representatives, health professionals, and funders of science.</p>



<p><br><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is already strongly and visibly committed to open peer review and open data. It could further boost the &lsquo;openness&rsquo; of the knowledge that it publishes by trialling and implementing novel approaches to sharing documentation of the processes that have generated data and the analytical code that has turned data into results.</p>



<h3><br>What developments are occurring in Medicine or your field of expertise that excite you at this time?</h3>



<p>I am excited by the promise (and fearful of the perils) of &lsquo;high tech&rsquo; for health promotion, and disease prevention and treatment. For interventions: digital approaches for health literacy and personalized health promotion, contextual social marketing for healthy lives, and for linking patients for mutual and real-time treatment support. For insight, such as wearables and sensors to measure exposures and outcomes in far greater detail and with far greater time resolution than in traditional visit-based studies. I am also excited by the potential of &lsquo;low tech&rsquo; for population health. Things such as salt reduction and substitution to reduce blood pressure, green and blue space exposure to boost mental resilience and health, and delayed prescriptions to reduce antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance.</p>



<h3><br>What is a topic in medical research you wish you knew more about?</h3>



<p>Network science. In particular how we can better use physical, biological, cognitive, and social network information to understand more deeply what drives population health &ndash; and how we can leverage networks for health interventions and policies.</p>



<h3><br>What is a fun fact about you?</h3>



<p>My favourite past time activities are skiing and playing old-fashioned board games with our kids, Amelie, Elias and Leo.</p>



<h3><br>What&rsquo;s on your reading list for the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> community?</h3>



<p>This summer I am reading three books. <em>A shot to save the world</em> by Gregory Zuckerman, which describes the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. I expect this will hold some important lessons on developing future systems to respond to new threats to population health. <em>Theory and reality</em> by Peter Godfrey-Smith, a wonderfully written survey of the major intellectual movements that have conceived science, and how they have challenged each other. I am rereading this book. <em>The art of gathering</em> by Priya Parker, which includes many recommendations for making meetings matter more. This book seems particularly timely as we are emerging from the COVID-related restrictions to our gatherings and have an opportunity to redesign how we meet in the coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">Who has the highest risk of long COVID? It’s complicated</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of people, COVID-19 doesn’t end with a negative test. Weeks or months after traces of the virus disappear from noses and throats, symptoms can persist or come back. New ones might pop up and stick around for months. People suffering from long COVID are unwillingly in it for the long haul — and it’s still unclear who’s at the highest risk for the condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers don’t yet have an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">official definition for long COVID</a>, and its symptoms are wide-ranging (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). Some people struggle with extreme fatigue that interferes with their daily lives. Others can’t concentrate or struggle with memory amid thick brain fog. Still others have organ damage or a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.</p>





<p>“There are a variety of different kinds of ways that people can have long COVID. It’s not just the one thing,” says Leora Horwitz, an internal medicine physician at New York University Langone Health. “That’s what makes it so hard to study.”</p>



<p>This spectrum of symptoms makes pinning down who’s at high risk for long-term health problems from the disease especially hard. Some post-COVID conditions may stem from virus-induced damage or from the stress of being hospitalized with severe disease. In other cases, the body’s own immune response to the virus could drive the damage. Or the virus may be hiding somewhere in the body, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">possibly the gut</a>, helping symptoms to persist (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). Different causes may have different risk groups, says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group studying long COVID.</p>



<p>There are some broad hints about who’s at risk. Studies suggest that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2022.2081454">women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms</a>. COVID-19 patients with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y">more than five symptoms in the first week of infection</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30836-0">preexisting health conditions such as asthma</a> may be more likely to develop long COVID. Age also appears to be a risk factor, though results are mixed regarding <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/nine-factors-could-boost-your-risk-long-covid">whether the burden falls on older people or middle-aged people</a>. Populations that were disproportionally hit by COVID-19 overall — including Black and Hispanic people — may similarly face disparities for long COVID. And while vaccination seems to protect people from developing long COVID, Horwitz says, it’s still unclear by how much.</p>



<p>Age is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html">more than 30 health problems</a>, including cancer and lung disease, that also raise the risk. “So many researchers assume that those [risk factors] will be the same for long COVID and there’s no scientific basis for that,” Davis says. There are many more that researchers could be missing when it comes to long COVID.</p>



<p>Using health records and exams, and knowledge of ailments with symptoms similar to long COVID, experts are on the hunt for those risk factors. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Examining health</h4>



<p>When it comes to getting a better handle on who’s at risk for long COVID — which also goes by the wonky alias Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection — electronic health records may hold important clues.</p>



<p>Horwitz is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER initiative that <a href="https://recovercovid.org/">aims to understand the long-term impacts</a> of COVID-19. One arm of the study involves mining millions of electronic health records to find potential patterns.</p>



<p>Studying millions of these records should pinpoint potential risk factors that are rare in the population overall but perhaps more common for people with long COVID, Horwitz says. “That’s hard even in a cohort study of thousands.”</p>



<p>But health records aren’t perfect: They depend on physicians logging that patients are having trouble sleeping or focusing, or that they’re exhausted. “The things people are complaining about, we’re really bad at writing down those diagnoses on the record,” Horwitz says. “So we miss that.” &nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>To account for health records’ deficiencies, Horowitz and colleagues are also directly studying thousands of people. Participants answer a questionnaire every three months so that the team can identify what kinds of symptoms people have and whether they’re getting better or worse.</p>



<p>Then blood, urine, stool and saliva samples can reveal what’s happening in the body. Tests on those samples can uncover if the coronavirus is still around and causing trouble, or if the immune system has learned to attack the body itself. Participants with abnormal test results will undergo additional, targeted testing.</p>



<p>“Unlike electronic health records where it’s hit or miss, like somebody might have had a CAT scan or might not, here we say, ‘OK, you have trouble breathing. We will take a look at your lungs,’” Horwitz says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study includes a range of participants: adults and kids, pregnant people, those currently with COVID-19 and people who died after having the disease.</p>



<p>Some of the potential risk factors that the team is looking for include autoimmune diseases and other viral infections. The list may grow as more people join the study. “We’re trying to balance the fishing versus making sure that we’re at least fishing for things that could be in the water,” Horwitz says.</p>



<p>Among short supply, though, are people who never caught the virus — important “controls” to highlight what’s different about people who got COVID-19.</p>



<p>So far, more than 7,000 people have signed up, and the group plans to recruit around 10,000 more. It’s a lot of data, but early results may soon start coming in.</p>



<p>“We’ll probably try to do an interim peek at those data this fall,” Horwitz says. “It’s tricky because we deliberately wanted to enroll 18,000 people so we would have enough power to really look at the things we care about. I don’t want to cheat and look too early, but we also know that there’s a lot of interest.”</p>



<h4>Striking similarities</h4>



<p>Some long COVID symptoms — brain fog, fatigue and trouble sleeping — mirror another illness: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS. Other long COVID symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness, fall in the category of nervous system disorders called dysautonomia. Similar symptoms could belie similar risk factors.</p>



<p>Yet potential risk factors for those conditions are largely missing from long COVID research, says Davis, who has had long COVID since March 2020. Among the possibilities that scientists are considering are things like Epstein-Barr virus, migraines and some autoimmune diseases.</p>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus could be a big one, Davis says. Infections last a lifetime because the virus can go into hiding in the body and possibly reemerge. That virus has been linked to ME/CFS for decades, though the connection is tenuous, Davis says.</p>

<p>Some early hints of a link between Epstein-Barr virus and long COVID already exist. Multiple studies have found evidence in blood samples from some long COVID patients that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276660v2">the immune system recently battled with Epstein-Barr virus</a>, which can cause infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by extreme fatigue. Other studies have <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00072-1?">found signs of the virus itself</a>. And in 2021, Davis and colleagues found that 40 out of 580 people with symptoms of long COVID who responded to an online survey reported having <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext">a current or recent Epstein-Barr virus infection</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With ME/CFS, it’s possible that another illness caused by a different virus triggers the Epstein-Barr virus, which then causes the fatigue syndrome. Given the parallels between that condition and long COVID, some scientists are wondering if the two are actually the same disease, with the coronavirus now known as one trigger.</p>



<p>Examining health conditions that raise the chances of long COVID could provide answers for both diseases, says Nancy Klimas, an immunologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. That’s in part because researchers can more easily identify people who developed lingering symptoms after a bout of COVID-19 compared with unknown infections that may precede ME/CFS.</p>



<p>Also, “there’s a huge difference in these two fields and it’s money,” Klimas says. She now has funding from the CDC to compare long COVID patients with people who have ME/CFS. The team hopes that physical exams and specialized tests will reveal whether the two diseases are indeed the same and be a step toward understanding the mechanisms behind the lingering symptoms.</p>



<p>Still, since long COVID as a whole encompasses such a wide range of symptoms, it will take time to uncover who is at risk of what.</p>



<p>If COVID-19 were just one disease impacting the lungs, heart or brain, the research might be easier, Horwitz says. “But we have to test everything.”</p>

<h3><b><i>‘’</i></b> <b><i>What is one piece of advice you would give to reviewers as an EBM overseeing peer review ?“ </i></b></h3>
<p>Here are their replies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise reviewers to think about how the manuscript at hand could be improved. The ultimate goal is to make published research better, such that the benefit to the public is maximized. I believe this can be achieved by being unbiased, open-minded, and thorough in assessing submitted work”. </span><strong>Dr Christiana Kartsonaki, senior statistician, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat every manuscript like treating your own paper. It’s vital to not only point out defects, but also to appreciate merits in each piece of work. Reviewers are not just making a choice between Accept and Reject. Instead, reviewers could offer valuable suggestions that are to the point and help authors improve the quality of the paper. Reviewers are not the opponents of authors, but teachers and friends who work side-by-side”. </span><strong>Prof Guo-wei Tu, Chief Physician and Associate Professor of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would advise reviewers to only commit to the review process if they have the time and required expertise for the specific manuscript. It is disheartening and inconvenient when reviewers agree to handle a manuscript but then don’t return any comments or provide very little feedback to the authors. The reviewing process should be constructive for the authors and it would be more beneficial if more highly experienced scientists were engaging with this”. </span><strong>Dr Stavroula Kanoni, Lecturer in Nutrigenetics and Cardiovascular Health, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts &amp; the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK</strong></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All reviewers, including me, are expected to abide by the ethical guidelines for peer reviewers published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). They are expected to spend adequate time to avoid missing anything. The history of medicine cannot forget the rejection of Sir Hans Adolf Krebs’ article by a prestigious journal in 1937, where he described the discovery which led him to obtain the Nobel prize. We should not let such egregious or even minor errors at lower scales be repeated”. </span><strong>Prof Elaheh Malakan Rad, Professor of Pediatric Interventional Cardiology, Children’s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would recommend reviewers pay more attention to the content of the paper and the validity of the proposed research rather than focus on the presentation. Some papers are written impeccably, but lack novelty or relevant research. I also suggest taking the right amount of time to review a paper since it is often the result of the authors&#8217; significant effort that must not be disregarded”. </span><strong>Prof Stafano Omboni, Director of the Italian Institute of Telemedicine, Italy and Professor of Cardiology, First Moscow State Medical University, Russia </strong></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reviewers are precious to every Journal because their judgements and comments represent an important part in the review process of a manuscript. For this reason, fulfilling the task of Reviewers requires time and dedication in terms of knowledge and engagement. Exhaustive comments received quickly help the authors progress in their research. I would hence recommend potential Reviewers to take some courses to learn how to become experts in the job. Also our Journal offers some training courses available online”. </span><strong>Dr Aldo Bonaventura, Division of Internal Medicine, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese, Italy</strong></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would generally recommend learning how to become an expert in reviewing. This is not an easy task. There are a few training courses available online. We must be focused on both the scientific approach and the manuscript&#8217;s quality. The published data can impair clinical practice and bring suffering to our patients. We are responsible to uphold the faith of the people in public health and must be careful in decision-making to prevent any complications deteriorating our patients&#8217; quality of life”. </span><strong>Dr John Alexander Kharlamov, De Haar Research Task Force, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Tallinn, Estonia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The advice I would give to any reviewer is: accept reviewing a manuscript when you have specific expertise on the topic and the ability to appraise the methods and results presented critically. It is always ok to apologize and decline to review if you are unable to handle a manuscript, or because of conflict of interest. Another critical point is to try to finalize your recommendations in time. We have all been in these situations where our paper&#8217;s decision is delayed because of the one reviewer who did not complete his review. Please do not be that reviewer”. </span><strong>Dr Michael Megaly, Interventional Cardiology Fellow and Clinical Instructor Faculty, Banner University Medical Center and UA College of Medicine-Phoenix, USA</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember that reviewing means being at the service of the authors. The first question a reviewer should ask themselves is whether the paper is out of scope or unsuitable for publication in that particular journal. If this is the case, do not delay your decision, as this will only harm the authors’ effort to find the right journal for their work. If the paper and journal are a good (or at least a possible) match, take the time to analyze the paper thoroughly, before making your decision and give feedback that will improve the author’s work”. </span><strong>Dr Claudio Montalto, Cardiology resident, University of Pavia, Italy and Interventional Cardiology Fellow, Oxford University Hospital NHS Trust, UK</strong></li>

Reviewer&#8217;s comments are the building blocks of the editorial board&#8217;s decision. My advice to all potential reviewers is: accomplish the assignment on time; keep an unbiased approach; provide comprehensive and constructive scientific comments in a friendly manner; highlight the significance of an article you review, thereby helping the associate editor make a final decision; inform the EBM if you cannot handle or understand any specific part of the manuscript, such as statistical and bioinformatics analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/demon-duck-mihirung-australia-bird-fossil">Ancient ‘demon ducks’ may have been undone by their slow growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant flightless birds called mihirungs were the biggest birds to ever stride across what is now Australia. The animals, which weighed up to hundreds of kilograms, died out about 40,000 years ago. Now researchers might have a better idea why.</p>



<p>The birds may have grown and reproduced <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25047">too slowly to withstand</a> pressures from humans’ arrival on the continent, researchers report August 17 in the<em> Anatomical Record</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mihirungs are sometimes called “demon ducks” because of their great size and close evolutionary relationship with present-day waterfowl and game birds. The flightless, plant-eating birds lived for more than 20 million years.</p>





<p>Over that time, some species evolved into titans. Take Stirton’s thunderbird (<em>Dromornis stirtoni</em>). It lived about 7 million years ago, stood 3 meters tall and could exceed 500 kilograms in weight, making it the largest-known mihirung and a contender for the largest bird ever to live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most research on mihirungs has been on their anatomy and evolutionary relationships with living birds. Little is known about the animals’ biology, such as how long they took to grow and mature, says Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a paleobiologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Chinsamy-Turan and colleagues at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia took samples from 20 fossilized leg bones of<em> D. stirtoni</em>, from animals of varying life stages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even after millions of years of fossilization, the microscopic structure of fossil bones generally remains intact,” and it can be used to decipher important clues about extinct animals’ biology, Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team examined the thin bone slices under a microscope, detailing the presence or absence of growth marks. These marks provide information on how fast the bone grew while the birds were alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>D. stirtoni</em> took 15 years or more to reach full size, the team found. It probably became sexually mature a few years before that, based on the timing of a shift from rapidly growing bone to a slower-growing form that’s thought to be associated with reaching reproductive age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results differ from the team’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/5/219/htm">earlier analysis</a> of the bones of another mihirung, <em>Genyornis newtoni</em>. That species — the last-known mihirung — was less than half the size of <em>D. stirtoni</em>. It lived as recently as about 40,000 years ago and was a contemporary of the continent’s earliest human inhabitants. <em>G. newtoni</em> grew up much faster than its giant relative, reaching adult size in one to two years and growing a bit more in the following years and possibly reproducing then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difference in how fast mihirung species that were separated by millions of years developed may have been an evolved response to Australia developing a drier, more variable climate over the last few million years, the researchers say. When resources are unpredictable, growing and reproducing quickly can be advantageous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, that seeming pep in the developmental step of more recent mihirungs was still slower than that of the emus they lived alongside. Emus grow up quickly, reaching adult size in less than a year and reproducing not long after, laying large numbers of eggs.</p>



<p>This difference may explain why <em>G. newtoni</em> went extinct shortly after hungry humans arrived in Australia, yet emus continue to thrive today, the team says. Even though over millions of years, mihirungs as a group seem to have adapted to growing and reproducing quicker than they used to, it wasn’t enough to survive the arrival of humans, who probably ate the birds and their eggs, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“Slowly growing animals face dire consequences in terms of their reduced ability to recover from threats in their environments,” Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientists’ research on other giant, extinct, flightless birds thought to have met their end thanks to humans — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-reveal-what-it-was-grow-dodo">dodos of Mauritius</a> (<em>Raphus cucullatus</em>) and the largest of Madagascar’s elephant birds (<em>Vorombe titan</em>) — shows that they too grew relatively slowly (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/29/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is very interesting to see this pattern repeating again and again with many large, flightless bird groups,” says Thomas Cullen, a paleoecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>Modern ratite birds seem to be the exception in their ability to handle similar pressures, he says. Other ratites besides emus that have survived until the present day — such as cassowaries and ostriches — also grow and reproduce quickly (<em>SN: 4/25/14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">Physicists dispute a claim of detecting a black hole’s ‘photon ring’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first image of a black hole may conceal treasure — but physicists disagree about whether it’s been found.</p>



<p>A team of scientists say they’ve unearthed a photon ring, a thin halo of light around the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87. If real, the photon ring would provide a new probe of the black hole’s intense gravity. But other scientists dispute the claim. Despite multiple news headlines suggesting the photon ring has been found, many physicists remain unconvinced.</p>





<p>Unveiled in 2019 by scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a> revealed a doughnut-shaped glow from hot matter swirling around the black hole’s dark silhouette (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). But according to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a thinner ring should be superimposed on that thick doughnut. This ring is produced by photons, or particles of light, that orbit close to the black hole, slung around by the behemoth’s gravity before escaping and zinging toward Earth.</p>



<p>Thanks to this circumnavigation, the photons should provide “a fingerprint of gravity,” more clearly revealing the black hole’s properties, says astrophysicist Avery Broderick of the University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. He and his colleagues, a subset of scientists from the EHT collaboration, used a new method to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7c1d">tease out that fingerprint</a>, they report in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Creating images with EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">isn’t a simple point-and-shoot affair</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Researchers stitch together data from EHT’s squad of observatories scattered across the globe, using various computational techniques to reconstruct an image. Broderick and colleagues created a new black hole image assuming it featured both a diffuse emission and a thin ring. On three out of four days of observations, the data better matched an image with the added thin ring than one without the ring.</p>



<p>But that method has drawn harsh criticism. “The claim of a photon ring detection is preposterous,” says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>A main point of contention: The photon ring is brighter than expected, emitting around 60 percent of the light in the image. According to predictions, it should be more like 20 percent. “That’s a giant red flag,” says physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. More light should come from the black hole’s main glowing doughnut than from the thin photon ring.</p>



<p>This unexpected brightness, Broderick and colleagues say, occurs because some of the light from the main glow gets lumped in with the photon ring. So the ring’s apparent brightness doesn’t depend only on the light coming from the ring. The researchers note that the same effect appeared when testing the method on simulated data.</p>



<p>But that mishmash of purported photon ring light with other light doesn’t make for a very convincing detection, critics say. “If you want to claim that you’ve seen a photon ring, I think you have to do a better job than this,” says astrophysicist Dan Marrone of the University of Arizona, a member of the EHT collaboration who was not a coauthor on the new paper.</p>



<p>The new result suggests only that an added thin ring gives a better match to the data, Marrone says, not whether that shape is associated with the photon ring. So it raises the question of whether scientists are seeing a photon ring at all, or just picking out an unrelated structure in the image.</p>



<p>But Broderick argues that the features of the ring — the fact that its size and location are as expected and are consistent day-to-day — support the photon ring interpretation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a similar, independent analysis, Gralla and physicist Will Lockhart, also of the University of Arizona, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09989">find no evidence for a photon ring,</a> they report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org. Their analysis differed from Broderick and colleagues’ in part because it limited how bright the photon ring could be.</p>



<p>To convincingly detect the photon ring, some scientists propose adding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-could-help-spot-photon-ring-black-hole-ever-imaged">telescopes in space</a> to the EHT’s crew of observatories (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). The farther apart the telescopes in the network are, the finer details they may be able to pick out — potentially including the photon ring.</p>



<p>“If there were a photon ring detection,” Lupsasca says, “that would be the best thing in physics this year, if not for many years.”</p>

But how do the various environments and ever changing conditions faced by these small cetacean impact their genetic diversity and have they adapted to their specific environment? This <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution </em>seascape genomic study uses genome wide and environmental data at the population level to look at selective pressure, adaptive population structure and population diversity in the common dolphin in southern Australia. Four key variables are identified to have an impact on genomic variation:  sea surface temperature, primary productivity, current velocity and salinity. These data can in turn help to inform on the impact of specific factors such as pollution and assist in the conservation efforts. This study lead to the identification of five populations of common dolphin to be considered as priority for population management and conservation. As a near top predator, dolphins are key players in their environments and a vital part of the food chain. Thus, impacts from anthropogenic activities such as fisheries or climatic disruptions on dolphin populations could have long standing effects on the whole of the marine ecosystem.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12972" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-768x509.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5-640x424.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Thailand is one of the world’s largest food exporter and sees a high usage of pesticides to boost productivity, especially herbicides.  The highest imported herbicide is Glyphosate. Glyphosate is a weak organic acid, often supplemented by adjuvants to increase its herbicidal properties. It is generally composed of an isopropylamine salt and a surfactant that is toxic to humans. Upon entrance into the body, Glyphosate is absorbed through the cell membrane and enters the bloodstream eventually spreading to the tissues and organs before being excreted by the body, primarily through urination and defecation.  Primary exposure to Glyphosate is through the skin and respiratory system while using herbicides and it has been linked to various illnesses, especially respiratory system afflictions. This <em>BMC Public Health </em>longitudinal pre-post study was conducted in maize farmer in Thailand using information from questionnaires, urine, blood samples and lung function assessment a day before and a day after glyphosate usage. As expected, exposure to glyphosate had negative impacts on oxidative stress, inflammation and lung function.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress can cause damage to cells and tissues and thus impact the body leading to increased inflammation. One of the by-product of oxidative damage is the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Upon oxidative stress, cells defend themselves by producing antioxidants in order to destroy damaging free radicals. Glutathione (GHS) plays a vital role in this process and acts to protect cells from oxidative stress. Glyphosate was shown to negatively impact the regulation of oxidative stress at different levels as exposure to glyphosate was shown to lead to a significant increase in the level of serum MDA and oxidative stress as well as a significant decrease in serum level of GHS. Furthermore, a statistically significant increase in inflammation was identified after glyphosate exposure as well as an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation which increases upon tissue injury, causes monocyte activation as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of complement. Last but not least, lung function was significantly decreased after application of glyphosate.</p>
<p>This study focused on the short term effects of acute exposure thus further studies on the long-term effect of glyphosate exposure are warranted.</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-12968 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
<p>Despite the popularity of microbiome studies, little is known about the impact of the presence of bacterial DNA in human blood and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The association between chronic diseases and CVD has been extensively studied and a number of risk factors are known to be associated an increase in CVD mortality such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, physical activity, history of heart diseases etc… In this <em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em> case-cohort study spanning over nearly 10 years, blood samples from men of a mean age of 70 were collected and their microbiome analysed in order to investigate a putative association with CVD mortality. Over 80% of the blood samples collected contained bacterial DNA from a whole range of bacteria originating from the gut, skin, oral cavity or the environment. Three genera were significantly associated with CVD mortality but the two most prevalent genera isolated, <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> were not and are part of the commensal microbiota.  The presence of two genera in blood, <em>Kocuria</em> and <em>Enhydrobacter</em>, was associated with an increased CVD mortality whereas it was the opposite for the third genera, <em>Paracoccus</em>. Interestingly, these correlations were identified independently of other know health and lifestyle risk factors for CVD mortality. This study reflects on the risk through a lifetime as it looks at older men and it will be useful to inform on of which genera to pursue in future research projects.</p>

This condition was traditionally diagnosed upon observation of an increase in blood pressure and high level of proteins in urine. Recent studies have found an association between temperature and the risk of preeclampsia. Indeed, it has now been shown that the risk of preeclampsia increases for women who have conceived in warmth months and delivered in cold months based on the study of seasonal or monthly temperature data. In this <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> study, the effect of short-term temperature exposure on the risk of preeclampsia was investigated using daily temperature data. The authors reported that there was a significantly larger number of hospital admissions for preeclampsia on cold days than on hot ones. Indeed, the highest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was observed on days where the mean temperature was lower than 10°C. Furthermore, the lowest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was on days where the mean temperature was higher than 30°C. The lag effect of low temperature preeclampsia risk was also identified as a significant risk factor.  Thus the recommendation was that in low temperature, pregnant women should stay warm and pay attention to their blood pressure and go to the hospital if it raises. This information could be used in order for governments to increase publicity on the impact of low temperature on the risk of preeclampsia and thus help to reduce that risk.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12970" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Estuaries are changing environments characterised by large variations in salinity levels due to the mixture of marine and fluvial waters. Thus their inhabitants have had to develop strategies to adapt to such fluctuations. This <em>BMC Genomics</em> study set out to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for the strong salinity tolerance of <em>Scatophagus argus</em>, the spotted cat fish, a recently developed mariculture specie by looking at differentially expressed proteins. They uncovered that cellular ion regulation transport as well as ATP synthesis are key players in the osmoregulatory process of its specialised gills that act as the main osmoregulatory organ. These gills have developed different strategies to enable the fish to adapt to different salinity level. Under hypo saline conditions, Na+ efflux is maintained through Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) increased activity leading to a reduction in the intracellular osmotic pressure. Simultaneously, an increased NKA internalisation prevents excessive ion loss. Upon hypersaline stress, excess ions are excreted through active transport and reduced NKA activity resulting in an increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Thus this fish has developed different osmoregulatory strategies in order to handle hypoosmotic as well as hyperosmotic stresses and thus adapt to an environment subject to large fluctuations in salinity levels. These result provide valuable insights on <em>Scatophagus argus</em> and the strategies used by estuarine fishes that should prove helpful to the expansion of commercial aquaculture.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-infection-471-days-coronavirus-evolution-variants">The curious case of the 471-day coronavirus infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>As <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron subvariant BA.5</a> continues to drive the coronavirus’ spread in the United States, I’ve been thinking about what could come next. Omicron and its offshoots have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed.">topping the variant charts</a> since last winter. Before that, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta reigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have a few ideas for how new variants emerge. One involves people with persistent infections — people who test positive for the virus over a prolonged period of time. I’m going to tell you about the curious case of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 for at least 471 days and what can happen when infections roil away uncontrolled.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That lengthy infection first came onto epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh&#8217;s radar in the summer of 2021. His team had been analyzing coronavirus strains in patient samples from Yale New Haven Hospital when Grubaugh spotted something he had seen before. Known only as B.1.517, this version of the virus never got a name like delta or omicron, nor rampaged through communities quite like its infamous relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after springing up somewhere in North America in early 2020, B.1.517 tooled around in a handful of regions around the world, even sparking an outbreak in Australia. But after April 2021, B.1.517 seemed to sputter, one of the who-knows-how-many viral lineages that flare up and then eventually fizzle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.1.517 might have been long forgotten, shouldered aside by the latest variant to stake a claim in local communities. “And yet we were still seeing it,” Grubaugh says. Even after B.1.517 had petered out across the country, his team noticed it cropping up in patient samples. The same lineage, every few weeks, like clockwork, for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One clue was the samples’ specimen ID. The code on the B.1.517 samples was always the same, Grubaugh’s team noticed. They had all come from a single patient.</p>



<p>That patient, a person in their 60s with a history of cancer, relapsed in November of 2020. That was right around when they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After seeing B.1.517 show up again and again in their samples, Grubaugh worked with a clinician to get the patient’s permission to analyze their data.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />for our latest preprint on the intrahost evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in an immunocompromised individual (60s) with a history of cancer chronically infected for at least 471 days (ongoing) with consistently replicating viruses at a high viral load. 1/n<a href="https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt">https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt</a></p>&mdash; Chrispin Chaguza (@ChrispinChaguza) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrispinChaguza/status/1543730086658056192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ultimately, the patient has <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.22276868v1.full">remained infected for 471 days</a> (and counting), Grubaugh, Yale postdoctoral researcher Chrispin Chaguza and their team reported last month in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Because of deteriorating health and a desire to maintain their anonymity, the patient was not willing to be interviewed, and Grubaugh has no direct contact with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all those samples collected over all those days told an incredible tale of viral evolution. Over about 15 months, at least three genetically distinct versions of the virus had rapidly evolved inside the patient, the team’s analyses suggested.</p>



<p>Each version had dozens of mutations and seemed to coexist in the patient’s body. “Honestly, if any one of these were to emerge in a population and begin transmitting, we would be calling it a new variant,” Grubaugh says.</p>



<p>That scenario is probably rare, he says. After all, lots of prolonged infections have likely occurred during the pandemic, and only a handful of concerning variants have emerged. But the work does suggest that persistent viral infections can provide a playground for speedy evolutionary experimentation — perhaps taking advantage of weakened immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grubaugh’s work is “probably the most detailed look we’ve had at a single, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 so far,” says Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved with the work.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>The study supports an earlier finding about a different immunocompromised patient — one with a persistent <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.22275533v1">omicron infection</a>. In that work, researchers documented the evolution of the virus over 12 weeks and showed that its descendant infected at least five other people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the studies lay out how such infections could potentially drive the emergence of the next omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am pretty well convinced that people with persistent infection are important sources of new variants,” Friedrich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who exactly develops these infections remains mysterious. Yes, the virus can pummel people with weakened immune systems, but “not every immunocompromised person develops a persistent infection,” says Viviana Simon, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who worked on the omicron infection study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, doctors and scientists have no idea how common these infections are. “We just don’t really have the numbers,” Simon says. That’s a huge gap for researchers, and something Mount Sinai’s <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/research/microbial-genomics-pathogen-surveillance">Pathogen Surveillance Program</a> is trying to address by analyzing real-time infection data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying patients with prolonged infections could also tell scientists where SARS-CoV-2 evolution is heading, Friedrich says. Just because the virus evolves within a person doesn’t mean it will spread to other people. But if certain viral mutations tend to arise in multiple people with persistent infections, that could hint that the next big variant might evolve in a similar way. Knowing more about these mutation patterns could help researchers forecast what’s to come, an important step in designing future coronavirus vaccine boosters.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Beyond viral forecasting, Grubaugh says identifying people with prolonged infections is important so doctors can provide care. “We need to give them access to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs,” he says. Those treatments could help patients clear their infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identifying persistent infections is easier said than done, he points out. Many places in the world aren’t set up to spot these infections and don’t have access to vaccines or treatments. And even when these are available, some patients opt out. The patient in Grubaugh’s study received a monoclonal antibody infusion about 100 days into their infection, then refused all other treatments. They have not been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the patient remained infectious over the course of the study, their variants never spread to the community, as far as Grubaugh knows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while untreated chronic infections might spawn new variants, they could emerge in other ways, too, like from animals infected with the virus, from person-to-person transmission in groups of people scientists haven’t been monitoring, or from “something else that maybe none of us has thought of yet,” he says. “SARS-CoV-2 has continued to surprise us with its evolution.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-anus-saccorhytus-coronarius-evolution">This bizarre ancient critter has been kicked out of a group that includes humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>No ifs, ands or butts about it: A teeny roughly 530-million-year-old critter that lacks an anus is not, as previously thought, the oldest member of a wide-ranging animal group that includes everything from starfish to humans.</p>



<p>Despite its absent anus, <em>Saccorhytus coronarius</em> had no shortage of holes on its wrinkly potato-shaped body, including a ring of small openings around its gaping mouth. Previously, those holes had been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinhead-sized-sea-creature-was-bag-mouth">identified as an early version of gill slits</a>, typically used for respiration (<em>SN: 2/3/17</em>). Gill slits are commonly found in deuterostomes, so their presence seemingly nailed the critter’s spot on the animal family tree.</p>





<p>But a new 3-D reconstruction of the half-millimeter-long species based on fossil imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05107-z">shows those holes are instead remnants of broken spines</a>, researchers report August 17 in <em>Nature</em>. The identification of the spines helped shift the creature into a group with arthropods and nematodes, called Ecdysozoa.</p>



<p>After millions of years, fossils can look very different from the original specimens, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">makes it challenging to identify biological features</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/22</em>). Most <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils have been flattened “like a very sad balloon that&#8217;s collapsed in on itself,” says paleontologist Philip Donoghue of the University of Bristol in England. The 3-D reconstruction brings <em>S. coronarius</em> to life — even if it does look something like an angry minion, he says.</p>



<p>Donoghue and his colleagues took X-rays of many <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils representing different stages of the organisms’ decay. The images revealed that an inner skin layer once pushed through pores and extended outward, forming spines. During fossilization, that inner layer was lost, and the holes were left behind.</p>



<p>While the spines pretty much lock <em>S. coronarius </em>into its new group, a puzzle remains: the absent anus. It’s not inherently weird —&nbsp;the absence has evolved independently in many species such as jellyfish, which vomit their food waste. But both deuterostomes and ecdysozoans usually have anuses, making <em>S. coronarius </em>an uncomfortable fit in either group.</p>



<p>Still, “if you haven&#8217;t got an anus,” Donoghue jokes, “you&#8217;re not going to be very comfortable anywhere.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">The Tonga eruption may have spawned a tsunami as tall as the Statue of Liberty</a></h4>

              
                <p>The massive Tonga eruption generated a set of planet-circling tsunamis that may have started out as a single mound of water roughly the height of the Statue of Liberty.</p>



<p>What’s more, the explosive eruption triggered an immense atmospheric shock wave that spawned <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822014810">a second set of especially fast-moving tsunamis</a>, a rare phenomenon that can complicate early warnings for these oft-destructive waves, researchers report in the October <em>Ocean Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano erupted</a> in the South Pacific in January, it displaced a large volume of water upward, says Mohammad Heidarzadeh, a civil engineer at the University of Bath in England (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). The water in that colossal mound later “ran downhill,” as fluids tend to do, to generate the initial set of tsunamis.</p>





<p>To estimate the original size of the mound, Heidarzadeh and his team used computer simulations, as well as data from deep-ocean instruments and coastal tide gauges within about 1,500 kilometers of the eruption, many of them in or near New Zealand. The arrival times of tsunami waves, as well as their sizes, at those locations were key pieces of data, Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>The team analyzed nine possibilities for the initial wave, each of which was shaped like a baseball pitcher’s mound and had a distinct height and diameter. The best fit to the real-world data came from a mound of water a whopping 90 meters tall and 12 kilometers in diameter, the researchers report.</p>



<p>That initial wave would have contained an estimated 6.6 cubic kilometers of water. “This was a really large tsunami,” Heidarzadeh says.</p>



<p>Despite starting out about nine times as tall as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-waves-2">the tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region of Japan</a> in 2011, the Tongan tsunamis killed only five people and caused about $90 million in damage, largely because of their remote source (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>).</p>



<p>Another unusual aspect of the Tongan eruption is the second set of tsunamis generated by a strong atmospheric pressure wave.</p>



<p>That pressure pulse resulted from a steam explosion that occurred when a large volume of seawater infiltrated the hot magma chamber beneath the erupting volcano. As the pressure wave raced across the ocean’s surface at speeds exceeding 300 meters per second, it pushed water ahead of it, creating tsunamis, Heidarzadeh explains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082522_sp_tonga-explosion_inline1.gif" alt="animation showing the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and the accompanying pressure wave, like a huge ripple" class="wp-image-3116693" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116693">The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano also triggered an atmospheric pressure wave that in turn generated tsunamis that traveled quicker than expected.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116693">NASA Earth Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Along many coastlines, including some in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, these pressure wave–generated tsunamis arrived hours ahead of the gravity-driven waves spreading from the 90-meter-tall mound of water. Gravity-driven tsunami waves typically travel across the deepest parts of the ocean, far from continents, at speeds between 100 and 220 meters per second. When the waves reach shallow waters near shore, the waves slow, water stacks up and then strikes shore, where destruction occurs.</p>



<p>Pressure wave–generated tsunamis have been reported for only one other volcanic eruption: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/krakatau-1883-shock-felt-round-world">the 1883 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/83</em>).</p>



<p>Those quicker-than-expected arrival times — plus the fact that the pressure-wave tsunamis for the Tongan eruption were comparable in size with the gravity-driven ones — could complicate early warnings for these tsunamis. That’s concerning, Heiderzadeh says.</p>



<p>One way to address the issue would be to install instruments that measure atmospheric pressure with the deep-sea equipment already in place to detect tsunamis, says Hermann Fritz, a tsunami scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>With that setup, scientists would be able to discern if a passing tsunami is associated with a pressure pulse, thus providing a clue in real time about how fast the tsunami wave might be traveling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">COVID-19 gave new urgency to the science of restoring smell</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the juice that tipped him off. At lunch, Ícaro de A.T. Pires found the flavor of his grape juice muted, flattened into just water with sugar. There was no grape goodness. “I stopped eating lunch and went to the bathroom to try to smell the toothpaste and shampoo,” says Pires, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Hospital IPO in Curitiba, Brazil. “I realized then that I couldn’t smell anything.”</p>



<p>Pires was about three days into COVID-19 symptoms when his sense of smell vanished, an absence that left a mark on his days. On a trip to the beach two months later, he couldn’t smell the sea. “This was always a smell that brought me good memories and sensations,” Pires says. “The fact that I didn’t feel it made me realize how many things in my day weren’t as fun as before. Smell can connect to our emotions like no other sense can.”<br><br>As SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, ripped across the globe, it stole the sense of smell away from millions of people, leaving them with a condition called anosmia. Early in the pandemic, when Pires’ juice turned to water, that olfactory theft became one of the quickest ways to signal a COVID-19 infection. With time, most people who lost smell recover the sense. Pires, for one, has slowly regained a large part of his sense of smell. But that’s not the case for everyone.</p>





<p>About 5.6 percent of people with post–COVID-19 smell loss (or the closely related taste loss) are still <a></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-069503">not able to smell or taste normally six months later</a>, a recent analysis of 18 studies suggests. The number, reported in the July 30 <em>British Medical Journal</em>, seems small. But when considering the estimated 550 million cases and counting of COVID-19 around the world, it adds up.</p>



<p>Scientists are searching for ways to hasten olfactory healing. Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have a better idea of how many people are affected and how long it seems to last. Yet when it comes to ways to rewire the sense of smell, the state of the science isn’t coming up roses.</p>



<p>A method called olfactory training, or smell training, has shown promise, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom. The technique has been around for a while; the coronavirus isn’t the first ailment to snatch away smell. But with newfound pressure from people affected by COVID-19, olfactory training and a host of other newer treatments are now getting a lot more attention.</p>



<p>The pandemic has brought increased attention to smell loss. “If we have to provide a silver lining, COVID is pushing the science at a speed that’s never happened before,” says Valentina Parma, an olfactory researcher and assistant director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “But,” she cautions, “we are really far from a solution.”</p>



<h4>Nasal attack</h4>



<p>Compared with sight or hearing, the sense of smell can seem like an afterthought. But losing it can affect people deeply. “Your world really changes if you lose the sense of smell, in ways that are usually worse,” Parma says. The smell of a baby’s head, a buttery curry or the sharp salty sea can all add emotional meaning to experiences. Smells can also warn of danger, such as the rotten egg stench that signals a natural gas leak.</p>



<p>As an ear, nose and throat doctor, Pires recalls a deaf patient who lost her sense of smell after COVID-19 and enrolled in a clinical trial that he and colleagues conducted on smell training. She worked in a perfumery company — her sense of smell was crucial to her job and her life. “At the first appointment, she said, with tears in her eyes, that it felt like she wasn’t living,” Pires recalls.</p>



<p>Unlike the cells that detect color or sound, the cells that sense smell can replenish themselves. Stem cells in the nose are constantly pumping out new smell-sensing cells. Called olfactory sensory neurons, these cells are dotted with molecular nets that snag specific odor molecules that waft into the nose. Once activated, these cells send messages through the skull and into the brain.</p>



<p>Because of their nasal neighborhood, olfactory sensory neurons are exposed to the hazards of the environment. “They may be covered with a little layer of mucus, but they’re sitting out there being constantly bombarded with bacteria and viruses and pollutants and who knows what else,” says Steven Munger, a chemosensory neuroscientist at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville.</p>



<p>Exactly how SARS-CoV-2 damages the smell system isn’t clear. But recent studies suggest the virus’s assault is indirect. The virus can infect and kill nose support cells called sustentacular cells, which are thought to help keep olfactory neurons happy and fed by delivering glucose and maintaining the right salt balance. That attack can inflame the olfactory epithelium, the layers of cells that line parts of the nasal cavity.</p>



<p>Once this tissue is riled up, the olfactory sensory neurons <a></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00135-0">get wonky</a>, even though the cells themselves haven’t been attacked. After an infection and ensuing inflammation, these neurons slow down the production of their odor-catching nets, a decrease that could blind themselves to odor molecules, scientists reported in the March 17 <em>Cell</em>.</p>



<p>With time, the inflammation settles down, and the olfactory sensory neurons can get back to their usual jobs, researchers suspect. “We do think that for post-viral smell disorders, the most common way to recover function is going to be spontaneous recovery,” Munger says. But in some people, this process doesn’t happen quickly, if ever.</p>



<p>That’s where smell training comes in.</p>



<h4>A nose workout</h4>



<p>One of the only therapies that exists, smell training is quite simple — a good old-fashioned nose workout. It involves deeply smelling four scents (usually rose, eucalyptus, lemon and cloves) for 30 seconds apiece, twice a day for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one study, 40 people who had smell disorders came away from the training with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.20101">improved smelling abilities</a>, on average, compared with 16 people who didn’t do the training, olfactory researcher Thomas Hummel and his colleagues reported in the March 2009 <em>Laryngoscope</em>.</p>



<p>Since then, the bulk of studies has shown that the method helps between 30 and 60 percent of the people who try it, says Hummel, of Technische Universität Dresden in Germany. His view is that the method can help some people, “but it does not work in everybody.”</p>



<p>One of the nice things is that there are no harmful side effects, Hummel says. That’s “the charming side of it.” But to do the training correctly takes discipline and stamina. “If you don’t do it regularly, and you give up after 14 days, this is futile,” he says.</p>



<p>Pires in his recent trial had hoped to speed up the process, which usually takes three months, by adding four more odors to the regimen. For four weeks, 80 participants received either four or eight smells. Both groups improved, but <a></a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19458924221113124">there was no difference between the two groups</a>, the researchers reported July 21 in the <em>American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not known how the technique works in the people it seems to help. It could be that it focuses people’s attention on faint smells; it could be stimulating the growth of replacement cells; it could be strengthening some pathways in the brain. Data from other animals suggest that such training can increase the number of olfactory sensory neurons, Hummel says.</p>



<p>Overall, this nose boot camp may be a possible approach for people to try, but big questions remain about how it works and for whom, Munger says. “In my view, it’s very important to be up front with patients about the very real possibility this therapy may not lead to a restoration of smell, even if they and their doctor feel it is worth trying,” he says. “I am not trying to discourage people here, but I also think we need to be very careful not to give unwarranted promises.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smell training doesn’t come with harmful biological side effects, but it can induce frustration if it doesn’t work, Parma says. In her practice, “I have been talking to a lot of people who say, ‘I did it every day for six months, twice a day for 10 minutes. I met in groups with other people, so we kept each other accountable, and I did that for six months. And it didn’t work for me.’” She adds, “I would want to address the frustration that this induces in patients.”</p>



<h4>Beyond training</h4>



<p>Other potential treatments are coming under scrutiny, such as steroids, omega-3 supplements, growth factors and vitamins A and E, all of which might encourage the recovery of the nasal epithelium.</p>



<p>More futuristic remedies are also in early stages of research. These include epithelial transplants designed to boost olfactory stem cells, treatments with platelet-rich plasma to curb inflammation and promote healing, and even an “electronic nose” that would detect odor molecules and stimulate the brain directly. This cyborg-smelling system takes inspiration from cochlear implants for hearing and retinal implants for vision.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Selling smell short</h3>



<p>People routinely undervalue the sense of smell. Some people rated the ability to smell as less important than various creature comforts, hair and even the little left toe, a recent survey found.</p>

<p>For many people, the sense of smell is appreciated only after it’s gone, Parma says, an apathy that’s illustrated in stark terms by a recent study of about 400 people. The vast majority of respondents — nearly 85 percent — would rather give up their sense of smell than sight or hearing. About 19 percent of respondents said they would prefer to give up their sense of smell than their cell phone. The survey results “dramatically illustrate the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/3">negligible value</a> people place on their sense of smell,” researchers wrote in the March <em>Brain Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Even as a doctor who treats people with smell loss, Pires has a newfound fondness for a good whiff. “Having lost it for a while made me appreciate it even more.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-atmosphere">The James Webb telescope spotted CO2 in an exoplanet’s atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has gotten the first sniff of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet in another solar system.</p>



<p>“It’s incontrovertible. It’s there. It’s definitely there,” says planetary scientist and study coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “There have been hints of carbon dioxide in previous observations, but never confirmed to such an extent.”</p>



<p>The finding, submitted to arXiv.org on August 24, marks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11692">the first detailed scientific result published from the new telescope</a>. It also points the way to finding the same greenhouse gas in the atmospheres of smaller, rockier planets that are more like Earth.</p>





<p>The planet, dubbed WASP-39b, is huge and puffy. It’s a bit wider than Jupiter and about as massive as Saturn. And it orbits its star every four Earth days, making it scorching hot. Those features make it a terrible place to search for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">evidence of extraterrestrial life</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>). But that combination of puffy atmosphere and frequent passes in front of its star makes it easy to observe, a perfect planet to put the new telescope through its paces.</p>



<p>James Webb, or JWST, launched in December 2021 and released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first images in July 2022</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). For about eight hours in July, the telescope observed starlight that filtered through the planet’s thick atmosphere as the planet crossed between its star and JWST. As it did, molecules of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbed specific wavelengths of that starlight. </p>



<p>Previous observations of WASP-39b with NASA’s now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope had detected just a whiff of absorption at that same wavelength. But it wasn’t enough to convince astronomers that carbon dioxide was really there.</p>



<p>“I would not have bet more than a beer, at most a six pack, on that weird tentative hint of carbon dioxide from Spitzer,” says astronomer Nicolas Cowan of McGill University in Montreal, who was not involved with the new study. The JWST detection, on the other hand, “is rock solid,” he says. “I wouldn’t bet my firstborn because I love him too much. But I would bet a nice vacation.”</p>



<p>The JWST data also showed an extra bit of absorption at wavelengths close to those absorbed by carbon dioxide. “It’s a mystery molecule,” says astronomer Natalie Batalha of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the team behind the observation. “We have several suspects that we are interrogating.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Carbon dioxide bump</h3>



<p>The spectrum of light that filtered through the atmosphere of exoplanet WASP-39 b shows strong evidence for containing carbon dioxide. The large bump in the middle of the spectrum shows that the planet’s atmosphere absorbed light with wavelengths around 4.3 micrometers — a clear sign of CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet’s atmosphere can reveal details about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">how the planet formed</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>). If the planet was bombarded with asteroids, that could have brought in more carbon and enriched the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. If radiation from the star stripped away some of the planet atmosphere’s lighter elements, that could make it appear richer in carbon dioxide too.</p>



<p>Despite needing a telescope as powerful as JWST to detect it, carbon dioxide might be in atmospheres all over the galaxy, hiding in plain sight. “Carbon dioxide is one of the few molecules that is present in the atmospheres of all solar system planets that have atmospheres,” Batalha says. “It’s your front-line molecule.”</p>



<p>Eventually, astronomers hope to use JWST to find carbon dioxide and other molecules in the atmospheres of small rocky planets, like the ones <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trappist-1-earth-sized-planets-top-science-stories-2017-yir">orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). Some of those planets, at just the right distances from their star to sustain liquid water, might be good places to look for signs of life. It&#8217;s yet to be seen whether JWST will detect those signs of life, but it will be able to detect carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“My first thought when I saw these data was, ‘Wow, this is gonna work,’” Batalha says.</p>
