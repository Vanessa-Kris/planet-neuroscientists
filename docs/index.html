                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/i908V6XekWQ/">PLOS welcomes the revised Plan S guidelines</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a fully Open Access publisher entirely ready to support cOAlition S-funded authors, we have always been in a position to give our support to this bold initiative, and entirely agree that the driving principles and overall objective of Plan S have not been lessened or changed. cOAlition S has clearly listened to constructive suggestions from the community, and there is now enhanced scope for continued community dialogue, alongside the forward momentum. There are a number of revisions which we recognize will make the transition easier for the community, and which clarify or acknowledge other important factors, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Diversity of models underpinning OA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The clarification that neither Plan S nor OA insists on the APC/publication fee model is a key refinement. While this has been a dominant model of OA publishing (including ours) in the Global North, it is absolutely necessary for any OA policies, plans, or mandates to be clear that OA is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcome</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for research, not a single or specific </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">business model</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Commitment to research assessment based on intrinsic merit </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– PLOS is an active member of DORA and appreciates the emphasis on changing the reward and incentive system of research. The OA movement has always operated closely with movements to improve the culture of research, and so we welcome this acknowledgement;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Preprints and peer review</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – PLOS advocates the posting of preprints to accelerate sharing of knowledge and welcomes cOalition S’s  “strong encouragement” for the early sharing of research through preprints while acknowledging that preprint posting alone is not a route to Plan S compliance. The value of high quality peer review as a “significant addition of value to scholarly communication” as emphasized in the Plan S Rationale is recognized at PLOS and was a driver in our move to offer published peer review, giving authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline shift for Plan S implementation to 2021 will be helpful to gain even more community support for the initiative. But we (along with many other publishers) remind the community that PLOS is already 100% Plan S compliant, and our suite of seven journals is available immediately for your cOAlition S-funded work  in most scholarly disciplines relevant to Plan S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS was founded on the principle that scholarly knowledge is a public good. We welcome the bold move of funders aligned behind the fundamental principle that no scholarly publication should be locked behind a paywall. </span></p>

A dubious paper just published in Molecular Neurobiology makes the suggestion that all military recruits should be offered genetic testing to assess their risk of PTSD. According to the authors, Kenneth Blum et al.,



We hypothesize that, even before combat, soldiers with a childhood background of violence (or with a familial susceptibility risk) would benefit from being genotyped for high-risk alleles (DNA variants). This process may assist us in identifying potential military candidates who

<p>My friends and I would often be so hooked on the latest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis">Sega Mega Drive</a> video game that we’d play all day long, breaking only for munchies or when nature called. Our parents would urge (plead with) us to get outside, especially when it was sunny. “The fresh air and exercise will do you good”, they would say, or similar. Fast forward to now, and the anxiety over all the time that children and young people spend in front of screens, be it playing video games, watching TV or using social media, has of course only intensified. Surely it can’t be mentally or physically healthy, can it?</p>
<p>As we look to psychologists to provide an answer, we find a field divided. At one extreme, some experts point to survey data throwing up apparently <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">worrying correlations between increased screen time and increased mental health problems</a>. Yet other experts are sceptical, in part because of what they see as the poor quality of much of the correlational evidence for harm.</p>
<p>In this latter camp are Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski at the University of Oxford, the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329">recent paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, which aims to set new standards for research in this area – including by using time-use diary-based reports of screen time (rather than relying on notoriously unreliable retrospective reports), and by pre-registering their methods and hypotheses, thus guarding against the kind of post-hoc data-mining that they say has plagued the field.</p>
<p><span id="more-37215"></span></p>
<p>The pair began with an exploratory analysis of two large surveys of thousands of teenagers, one based in Ireland, the other in the USA. These included data on teens’ mental health and wellbeing (including mood, depression and self-esteem) and their screen time (including time on TV, computer, and video-games and smartphones). The screen time measures included commonly used retrospective reports, such as “how much time do you typically spend during a weekday watching TV, playing video games etc?”, but crucially also detailed diary-based measures, in which each participant broke down their precise activities during every 15-minute period of a given day (either completed through that day, in the evening or the next day).</p>
<p>Orben and Przybylski found a handful of statistically significant correlations between screen time and wellbeing, and then they used these to make some specific evidence-based, pre-registered (written down publicly in advance) predictions about the kind of screen time–wellbeing associations they were looking for in a second, “confirmatory study”. This is a robust methodological approach that avoids the pitfalls of scouring a large data set hunting for all and any significant correlations (such post-hoc result hunting carries the risk that any associations that do turn up are flukes rather than meaningful).</p>
<p>The survey data Orben and Przybylski used in their confirmatory study involved over 10,000 British teenagers (aged 14 to 15) and their caregivers, who once again provided retrospective and diary-based information on their screen time and completed wellbeing measures.</p>
<p>The researchers found a few statistically significant correlations, including: between greater self-reported screen time and lower wellbeing; and greater diary-recorded screen time and lower wellbeing. Based on some mixed results from the exploratory work, the pair also looked specifically at screen time prior to bed, but this was not found to be associated with wellbeing. Critically, the significant associations that Orben and Przybylski did find were very weak – in fact, of a magnitude “too small to merit substantial scientific discussion”.</p>
<p>The pair provide a graphic illustration of the average size of the associations between screen time and wellbeing that they found. Assuming that causality flows in the direction of greater screen time to poorer wellbeing (the research is cross-sectional so we don’t know if this is the case), then given the size of the association, teenagers would have to increase their screen time use by over 63 hours per day for it to have an effect on their wellbeing that they would actually notice (this is based on what is known from past research about the kind of wellbeing changes that are subjectively noticeable). Of course such an increase is a practical impossibility, thus showing the practical insignificance of the documented correlations.</p>
<p>While aiming to set new standards for research in this area, the researchers admit their study has its own limitations – among them that the data on screen time and wellbeing were not collected at the same time, potentially reducing the chance to identify meaningful relations between the two. Also, some may wonder whether total screen time (however carefully it is measured) is the right metric – perhaps it is too crude and it is the nature of one’s relationship with digital devices that is more relevant to wellbeing, such as why they are used, whether the screen time displaces other meaningful activities, and if there is a compulsive quality to the usage or not.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-4-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>What made you look at a sibling design to study associations between maternal and offspring preterm birth? </strong></h3>
<p>Compared to term infants, preterm infants, especially those born earliest, are more likely to experience a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608601361?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">myriad of health-related problems</a>, from neurodevelopmental problems in childhood to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders later in life. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608600744?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">etiology of preterm birth</a> is multifactorial, complex and not well understood. One poorly understood factor is the intergenerational recurrence of preterm birth. <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3109/00016340903358820" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Several studies</a> have consistently shown that women born preterm are more likely to have preterm babies. Based on this evidence, it has been recommended to include maternal birth status in risk assessment when planning pregnancy care for individual women.</p>
<p>The problem with most previous studies is that they were not designed to account for familial confounding. Comparing preterm delivery rates of women born preterm versus women born at term, regardless of family characteristics, does not answer the question of whether being born preterm is itself a risk factor for preterm delivery. Women born preterm may have different family characteristics than those born at term and those characteristics may account for the higher risk of preterm delivery. To answer that question appropriately and rule out familial confounding, we need to compare sisters of discordant preterm birth status using sibling designs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sibling designs are particularly suited to study the effect of a factor that differs between siblings; in this case, whether a woman who was born preterm is more likely to deliver preterm than her sister(s) not born preterm. If being born preterm is itself a risk factor, then preterm sisters would be more likely to deliver preterm babies than their sisters not born preterm. Conversely, if discordant siblings have a similar risk of delivering preterm, this means that being born preterm is not the cause, but something else that is shared by the sisters and puts both sister at higher risk. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2304-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That is precisely what we found</a>. Women born at term with a sister born preterm had a similarly elevated risk of delivering a preterm infant (10%) as their preterm sisters, in contrast with women born at term with sisters born at term (6.1%) or without sisters (6.0%).</p>
<h3><strong>What are the potential implications of your research in identifying women at higher risks of preterm delivery?</strong></h3>
<p>The main implication is that the focus of the risk assessment may be better shifted from the individual to the family. Our results suggest that it is not the fact of having been born preterm that puts women at higher risk of delivering preterm, but the fact of having been born to a mother who ever delivered preterm. Our findings do not support the notion of seeing maternal preterm birth status itself as an individual risk factor for preterm delivery. Rather, consideration of a female family history of preterm birth in risk assessments may better identify women at higher risk of preterm delivery and perhaps other pregnancy complications characterized by intergenerational transmission patterns, such as hypertensive disorders.</p>

<p>Sex is an <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/20/three-week-diary-study-sex-today-increases-sense-of-meaning-in-life-tomorrow/">important part</a> of most <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/14/try-something-new-together-research-shows-engaging-in-self-expanding-activities-rekindles-the-sexual-desire-of-long-term-couples/">romantic relationships</a> – and when couples are not on the same page about their sex life, it can become a source of frustration. Research has found that couples have sex about 1 or 2 times a week, but about half of sexual advances between partners go unfulfilled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A preprint <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/p9nc8/">uploaded recently to PsyArXiv</a> sheds some light on how responses to sexual advances influence individuals’ feelings of sexual and relationship satisfaction. The study suggests that while having an advance accepted leaves partners feeling more content, this effect may be short-lived compared to the dissatisfaction of being rejected.</p>
<p><span id="more-37241"></span></p>
<p>To get a peek into the bedrooms of 115 heterosexual couples (participants were aged between 19 and 64), Kiersten Dobson from the University of Western Ontario and colleagues asked them all to keep sex diaries. Every day for 3 weeks, both partners independently logged whether they or their partner had made a sexual advance, and if so, whether that led to sexual activity. They also recorded their daily levels of satisfaction with their sexual relationship, as well as their relationship generally, answering questions such as “How good is your relationship compared to most?”</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found that accepting a sexual advance, or having an advance accepted by the partner, resulted in an increase in both sexual and relationship satisfaction that day compared to other days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the other hand, being rejected decreased sexual satisfaction. But intriguingly, if the participant themselves was the rejecter – that is, if they shunned an advance from their partner – their sexual satisfaction still increased. (Neither being rejected nor being the rejecter had any effect on general relationship satisfaction.)</p>
<p>Changes in sexual satisfaction could still be detected days after advances were made. The team found that the boost in satisfaction from having an advance accepted persisted for 24 hours, with the slump of being rejected lasting twice as long. And the gratification that came from being either an acceptor or a rejecter lasted a remarkable 72 hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It might seem especially surprising that rejecting a partner’s advances gives a boost in sexual satisfaction, particularly one that appears to last for three days. But rather than reflecting some pleasure derived from rejecting someone, the researchers suggest that being approached for sex leaves a person feeling desired, so enhances sexual satisfaction even when no actual sex ends up happening.</p>
<p>The fact that the negative effects of being sexually rejected by a partner last longer than the positive effects of being accepted mean that making an advance can be a risky move, the authors say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The act of making a sexual advance may be a high-risk situation for romantic partners, which may in turn lead those who feel less sure of their partner’s response to an advance to take the risk of making an advance less often,” they write. This could ultimately lead to fewer opportunities to bolster intimacy through sex.</p>
<p>The study doesn’t reveal anything about whether there is a way to buffer against the negative effects of rejection, though, or how different individuals respond. For example, the same team previously found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/25/study-of-long-term-heterosexual-couples-finds-women-over-estimate-and-men-underestimate-their-partners-sexual-advances/">men underestimate, and women overestimate, how often their partners make sexual advances</a> – though gender didn’t seem to play a role in the new study. However, it would be interesting to know whether other individual differences might alter people’s responses to acceptance or rejection.</p>

PLOS is excited to support reagent repositories such as Addgene as yet another step to improve scientific reproducibility. Open access to research findings and the underlying methods, materials and data, and issues surrounding reproducibility, replication, and research waste will be discussed this June 2-5 at the</span></i><a href="http://www.wcri2019.org/index/programme/conference-theme"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 6</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> World Conference on Research Integrity in Hong Kong</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where PLOS ONE’s Senior Editor, Renee Hoch, will present a talk on data availability and image integrity.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without materials and data, there is no research. Barriers to scientific progress can result from something as basic as not having access to reliable, validated information for research materials. That barrier is raised further when scientists cannot obtain samples or data in a timely fashion. Data and material repositories are breaking down these barriers. As a publisher, PLOS is supporting better, more open science by recommending repositories and encouraging use of standardized, unique identifiers </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized depositing of materials advances science in so many ways. It saves authors the time and burden of shipping requested materials. Researchers who request from repositories save time by not having to recreate reagents or wait months or years to receive samples. Many scientists have been on the receiving end of a request that was filled by an incorrect or degraded sample, which further delays research. Repositories like the ones recommended by </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> handle the logistics of material requests, letting the scientists focus on what’s important: doing research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, repositories make it possible for researchers to get access to different cell lines (</span><a href="http://www.atcc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Type Culture Collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.coriell.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coriell Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), plant materials (</span><a href="https://abrc.osu.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), organisms (</span><a href="https://bdsc.indiana.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://xenopusresource.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Xenopus Resource Centre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.jax.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), plasmids (</span><a href="https://www.addgene.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNASU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/Home.xhtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PlasmID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and many other biological materials. Moreover, many of these repositories provide web-based databases that are easy to search and provide openly available information about each material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For reagent reporting, many repositories also support</span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/unique-and-persistent-plasmid-ids-available-addgene-plasmid-ids-rrids"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unique and persistent identification of reagents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Identifiers like </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it easy for authors to cite materials and improves reporting through standardized identification and a permanent link to information about each reagent. For example, each </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drosophila</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strain at the Bloomington Fly stock Center is assigned a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=BDSC_722&amp;l=BDSC_722"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fly stock RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For mice, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) provides a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=MMRRC_026409-UCD&amp;l=MMRRC_026409-UCD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mouse RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for mutant mouse strains. For plasmids, Addgene will automatically register a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;l=Addgene_44362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plasmid RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon deposit. </span></p>
<p><b>Depositing increases materials transparency and reproducibility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene currently contains over 70,000 unique plasmids and has distributed </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/celebrating-one-million-plasmids-shared"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 1,000,000 plasmids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worldwide since 2004. At Addgene, depositing plasmids is free and straightforward, with the added bonus that it provides quality control measures that contribute to improved reproducibility. Addgene performs full plasmid sequencing and each plasmid is assigned a unique </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;l=Addgene_44362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RRID identifier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with </span><a href="https://www.addgene.org/44362/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a plasmid webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that provides sequence data, cloning information, and associated protocols. This ensures researchers have detailed information about each plasmid reagent. Moreover, each Addgene plasmid page provides an </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/more-data-for-you-find-articles-citing-addgene-plasmids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articles Citing this Plasmid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section which allows researchers to learn how the plasmid was used and validated by different labs.</span></p>
<p><b>Recognition and credit for depositing authors</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depositing materials at the time of publication also provides benefits to both authors and publishers. Depositing authors gain recognition and are cited whenever requestors use the published materials in their own research articles. In fact, data from Addgene supports that depositing published plasmids in Addgene’s repository increases their use and </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/addgene-depositors-get-more-citations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results in increased article citations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Deposition at the point of publication also ensures timely distribution of materials. Finally, the information linked to each deposited reagent serves as reliable open data for the materials reported in the publication, simplifying the manuscript-writing process. Overall, PLOS’s support of reagent repositories, follows the publisher’s steps in improving </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data availability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocol sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is a welcome addition for improving materials access and scientific reproducibility.</span></p>
<p><b>New sharing practices will change science for the better</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By encouraging authors to deposit materials at the time of publication, journals will help accelerate research through timely distribution and accurate identification of reagents. Biological repositories exist to serve the scientific community. Take </span><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/crispr.2018.0022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene’s involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the explosive advancement of CRISPR research. Since 2012, over 8,400 CRISPR plasmids have been deposited and Addgene has distributed over 144,000 CRISPR plasmids worldwide, enabling researchers to share, modify, and improve this game-changing molecular tool. It is a prime example of the positive impact that biological repositories are making on research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to PLOS’s updated recommendations, the importance of depositing and sharing reagents is finally getting some much-needed recognition. If the positive outcomes of PLOS’s </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data availability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocol sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policies is any indication of what’s in store for open material sharing, the future of science looks bright: speedier, more transparent, and more reproducible research.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I hurt myself today</i><br />
<i>To see if I still feel</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From <i>Hurt </i>by Nine Inch Nails</p>
<p>Deliberate self-injury (without the intent to commit suicide) is widely thought to be a way that some people, especially teenagers and young adults, cope with or express feelings that they find overwhelming. However, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/2azer/">a set of three studies</a> published as a preprint at <em>PsyArXiv</em> by psychologists at Swansea University, reveals that difficulties with perceiving and interpreting the bodily signals of emotion may also play a role – a finding that could help inspire new treatment approaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37238"></span></p>
<p>Previously, interviews with people who have self-harmed have included reports that they feel both “overwhelmed” by emotions they can’t identify, but also emotionally detached or “numb”. Hayley Young and her colleagues reasoned that if an individual is struggling to read their bodily signals of emotion properly (and “interoceptive ability” – the ability to sense physiological signals – is known to dip in adolescence), then self-injury may work to generate a stronger bodily input into their emotional experience.</p>
<p>The researchers ran three related studies using more than 300 young adult participants, mostly women. In the first few studies, the researchers looked for links between self-harm and self-reported factors, such as perceived difficulties in identifying and describing emotions. In the final study, interoceptive ability was measured using a standard method in which a person has to count their heartbeats over a period of time (without actually feeling for a pulse or using any other aid.)</p>
<p>Overall, the results revealed that participants with a history of self-harm were characterised by “a difficulty in distinguishing and interpreting interoceptive signals”. Participants who had self-harmed reported being <i>more</i> aware than others of general bodily sensations, but they tended to score worse on the interoceptive accuracy test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“This is an important finding as low interoceptive awareness may be the biological basis for reports of ‘absent affect’ and ‘detachment’ and ‘disembodiement’” in those who self-harm, the researchers write. Low interoceptive accuracy may also contribute to self-harm, they suggest, in driving the individual to manipulate the way the body contributes to the experience of emotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A function of self-harm “may be to resolve a state of interoceptive and emotional uncertainty —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[it] may serve to disambiguate the body’s role in emotional experience and provide clarity about what is being felt,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new findings add to past research that’s linked superior interoception to <a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68667/">better emotional functioning</a>, including experiencing more nuanced emotions. Conversely, <a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/74442/">poor interoception has been associated with a wide range of mental health problems</a>, including depression and schizophrenia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Young and her team added that their research suggests a pathway to new interventions: “a focus on improving compassionate self-focus may be beneficial.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In fact, other groups are actively working on ways to improve people’s interoceptive accuracy. Sarah Garfinkel at the University of Sussex and her team are trialling just such a treatment for people with autism (poor interoception is relatively common in people with autism spectrum disorder). A pilot study on healthy people, which involved asking participants to count their heartbeats, and giving them feedback on how well they were doing, led to improvements in interoceptive accuracy and reductions in anxiety. This treatment research is ongoing. In theory, it might help with other conditions, too.</p>

</center><p>This year, <a class="reference external" href="https://flocktofedora.org/">Flock</a> will be held in Budapest from August 8--11.
As part of <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, we've already proposed a talk to discuss how Free/Open
source software links very very well with Free/Open science. Please see the
proposal here, and give feedback: <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112">https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from that, given that a large number of community members congregate at
<a class="reference external" href="https://flocktofedora.org/">Flock</a>, it may be a good chance to get together those of us that work in
science/research and related areas. So, if you are planning to attend <a class="reference external" href="https://flocktofedora.org/">Flock</a>
and work in, or are interested in science/research, please drop a note at this
tracker ticket: <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242">https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242</a></p>
<p>If we have enough of us, we can look at proposing a hackathon also. The first
round of CFPs for flock starts on June 1. So we won't make it for that. We
should be able to make it for the second round on June 15, though.</p>
<p>Please, spread the word!</p>

They are canids – dog-like carnivores – with one of, if not the widest distributions of terrestrial mammals in the world. Due to their extreme adaptability, they have successfully colonized almost all terrestrial environments on the planet, from the icy tundra of the North to the scorching hot Australian Outback.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11067" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11067" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/9550_07150799-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Red foxes don’t need much of an introduction</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>They also cope well with landscape types that are heavily modified by humans, such as for example agricultural landscapes and even cities. Here, they find all the required resources in abundance and, as a result, can become very abundant themselves.</p>
<p>This is not a problem in itself, but it can become one for the species that foxes prey upon. Species that are very specialized in their habitat requirements often struggle to survive in heavily fragmented landscapes due to the loss of habitat, but also because of the lower suitability of the remaining habitat fragments. Picture a small forest surrounded by crop fields. Although it is normal for foxes to prey on these species, in such a situation, high predatory losses may become the nail in the coffin for some of those species.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it is often impossible to reverse changes to the landscape and its habitats. Instead, wildlife managers and conservation practitioners often attempt to control populations of abundant predators (including foxes) to benefit prey, usually by means of culling. However, owing to a variety of reasons (e.g. the legal framework, property rights, limited resources), control attempts often take place in comparatively small areas bordering on non-hunted sites that act as a source of foxes to compensate the cull.</p>
<p>Despite their widespread occurrence, the effectiveness of such control attempts in terms of their conservation returns is rarely evaluated and therefore not well understood. This may imply that their application is legitimized by conservation targets that are, in fact, often not being achieved.</p>
<p>When we talk about effectiveness, we mean two things: first off, control attempts need to cause a reduction</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11066" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11066" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/7765_08010371-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fox taking artificial eggs</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>in fox abundance of relevant magnitude at the target site. More importantly though, reduced abundance needs to be reflected by reduced predation risk for the prey species over a period of time that is considered particularly relevant, such as its reproduction.</p>
<p>Simply put, when we decide in favor of killing wild animal populations, we need to make sure that this will actually result in a better chance for the threatened prey to survive. Otherwise, both ethical and economic issues make the matter too contentious to qualify as a management tool in conservation.</p>
<p>This is the issue we tackled in a recent research project using fox culls in fragmented montane forests as a study system. Using camera-supervised ‘artificial nests’ consisting of brown chicken eggs placed in the forest to serve as a standardized index of predation risk, we evaluated whether incentivized, but spatially heterogeneous fox culls led to a reduction in predation risk and the probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites.</p>
<p>We chose the early summer months of 2017 and 2018 for our experiments to coincide with the reproductive period of a locally threatened prey species: the capercaillie, a fairly specialist bird that nests on the ground in mature and well-structured forest stands. The majority of culling had taken place during the winters preceding the study periods.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11063" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11063" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Capercailliefemale-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A female capercaillie close to an artificial nest</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Using statistical models, we did not find an effect of restricted-area fox culls on predation risk, nor a lower probability of encountering a fox at hunted sites. We know from other research (including our own) that culls of this magnitude can reduce local fox abundance, but effects appear to be compensated by fox populations too rapidly for conservation benefits to manifest. This was the case despite cull intensity likely exceeding red fox density in the area.</p>
<p>Interestingly (and in contrast to previous work), there was no relationship between the degree of landscape fragmentation <em>per se</em> and our index of predation risk, as soon as we had accounted for differences in predator abundance. Instead, predation risk appeared to be driven directly by the abundance of foxes in the landscape around a plot. This suggests that the increased abundance of generalist mesopredators in diverse, fragmented landscape types may be a key factor for elevated predation rates.</p>
<p>The practical implementation of our work is that predator control attempts will – to be effective as a conservation tool – need to be spatially and temporally coordinated to match the biology of both the predator and the target prey species. Whether this can be feasible, depends strongly on regional and local ecosystem contexts and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Otherwise, there is currently little evidence to support uncoordinated culls as a conservation measure.</p>

<p><em>Write down the unfinished statement “I am …” twenty times. Now think to yourself “Who am I?” and complete as many of the “I am …” statements as you can in the next five minutes or less.</em></p>
<p>This is the Twenty Statements Test and it’s designed to assess how we see ourselves – our “self-concept”. For their <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2019.1608256">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Memory</em>, a team at the University of Reading, led by Emily Hards, gave this test to 822 teenagers (aged 13-18) from three schools in England, with the additional instruction “not to think too much about the responses and not to worry about the order/importance of the statements”.</p>
<p>While it’s widely recognised that adolescence is a crucial period for the establishment of our sense of self, little is actually known about how teenagers’ generally see themselves. Indeed, this is the first time that teenagers’ own self-generated descriptions of themselves (what the researchers call their “self-images”) have been gathered in a systematic way.</p>
<p><span id="more-37210"></span></p>
<p>In all, the participants provided 6,558 self-descriptions or self-images. After removing any redundancy (for example, treating “I am irritating at times” and “I am somewhat irritating” as the same response), the researchers calculated that the teens came up with 443 different ways of describing themselves.</p>
<p>On average, the participants provided eight self-images. The twenty most commonly given, from most to least, were: happy, a son/daughter, funny, a student, a sports player, a friend, a brother/sister, kind, friendly, [some kind of description of] appearance, [description of] height, tired, sporty, caring, confident, [something about their] age, love, smart, shy, [description of their] gender, quiet.</p>
<p>Overall then, at a time when there is much talk of a crisis of mental health among young people, the researchers said their results paint a rather a “striking and reassuring” picture. Most of the teens’ self-images pertained to traits, and most of them were positive.</p>
<p>The participants’ focus on their personal characteristics and traits is consistent with “broader ideas in developmental psychology,” the researchers said, “which suggest that during adolescence young people become increasingly focused on their ‘psychological interior’ and engage in self-reflection.”</p>
<p>A few gender differences were apparent: girls tended to provide more self-images than boys; girls more often described themselves as a daughter (relative to how often boys described themselves as a son), as being a sibling, a friend, mentioning their appearance, as tired, caring, love, shy, or quiet; whereas boys more often described themselves as a sports player and sporty.</p>
<p>The researchers also compared the teenagers’ self-images with those obtained in an earlier study from a sample of predominantly young adults (aged 18 to 30). The main difference was that whereas the teenagers mostly described themselves in terms of their traits, the adults more often described themselves in terms of their social roles, such as friend or son. “…[S]ocial roles may be more accessible and important among adults than adolescents” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The images we form of ourselves in adolescence can have a lasting impact on the rest of our lives – shaping (and being shaped by) the autobiographical memories that we hold most dear, thereby influencing the way we see ourselves for years to come. Though limited by its monocultural and cross-sectional design, this research helps lay the groundwork for a better understanding how people come to see themselves the way they do, and for investigating what might be different about the self-images of those teenagers who develop depression or other mental health problems. Hards and her colleagues have also made their findings publicly available as a searchable database, providing a useful resource for future research.</p>

A paper in a peer-reviewed medical journal makes the suggestion that physicist Stephen Hawking's disability, which famously confined him to a wheelchair and robbed him of his speech, was psychosomatic in nature.



Hmm. I think this says more about the author than it does about Hawking.







The paper is called Delusional Health Beliefs and it comes by British doctor Peter May. It was published a few days ago in the Medico-Legal Journal.







May begins the paper by discussing conversion di

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.davidrobson.me/">David Robson</a></p>
<p>Socrates famously declared that “the unexamined life is not worth living” and that “knowing thyself” was the path to true wisdom. But is there a right and a wrong way to go about such self-reflection?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Simple rumination – the process of churning your concerns around in your head – isn’t the answer. It’s likely to cause you to become stuck in the rut of your own thoughts and immersed in the emotions that might be leading you astray. Certainly, research has shown that people who are prone to rumination also often suffer from impaired <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000308">decision-making under pressure</a> and are at substantially increased risk of depression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Instead, the scientific research suggests that you should adopt an ancient rhetorical method favoured by the likes of Julius Caesar and known as “illeism” – or speaking about yourself in the third person (the term was <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/01/illeism-the-weird-habit-of-talking-about-oneself-in-the-third-person/">coined by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> from the Latin <em>ille</em> meaning “he, that”). If I was considering an argument that I’d had with a friend, for instance, I may start by silently thinking to myself “David felt frustrated that…” The idea is that this small change in perspective can clear your emotional fog, allowing you to see past your biases.</p>
<p>A bulk of research has already shown that this kind of third-person thinking can temporarily improve decision making. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/a5fgu">preprint</a> at <em>PsyArxiv</em> finds that it can also bring long-term benefits to thinking and emotional regulation. It is, according to the authors, “the first evidence that wisdom-related cognitive and affective processes can be trained in daily life and of how to do so.”</p>

<p>Grossmann’s aim is to build a strong experimental footing for the <a href="https://evidencebasedwisdom.com/">study of wisdom</a>, which had long been considered too nebulous for scientific inquiry. In one his earlier experiments, he established that it’s possible to measure wise reasoning and that, as with IQ, people’s scores matter. He did this by asking participants to discuss out-loud a personal or political dilemma, which he then scored on various elements of thinking long-considered crucial to wisdom, including: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/">intellectual humility</a>; taking the perspective of others; recognising uncertainty; and having the capacity to search for a compromise. Grossmann found that these wise-reasoning scores were far better than intelligence tests at <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%25252Fa0029560">predicting emotional well-being, and relationship satisfaction</a> – supporting the idea that wisdom, as defined by these qualities, constitutes a unique construct that determines how we navigate life challenges.</p>
<p>Working with Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, Grossmann has also looked for ways to improve these scores – with some striking experiments demonstrating the power of illeism. In a series of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916084">laboratory experiments</a>, they found that people tend to be humbler, and readier to consider other perspectives, when they are asked to describe problems in the third person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Imagine, for instance, that you are arguing with your partner. Adopting a third-person perspective might help you to recognise their point of view or to accept the limits of your understanding of the problem at hand. Or imagine you are considering moving jobs. Taking the distanced perspective could help you to weigh up the benefits and the risks of the move more dispassionately.</p>
<p>This previous research only involved short-term interventions, however – meaning it was far from clear whether wiser reasoning would become a long-term habit with regular practice at illeism.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To find out, Grossmann’s team first asked nearly 300 participants to describe a challenging social situation,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>while two independent psychologists scored them on the different aspects of wise reasoning (intellectual humility etc). The participants then had to fill out a daily diary for four weeks. Each day they had to describe a situation they’d just experienced, such as a disagreement with a colleague or some bad news. Half were prompted to do so in the first-person, while the others were encouraged to describe their trials from a third-person perspective. At the end of the study all participants repeated the wise-reasoning test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grossmann’s results were exactly as he hoped. While the control participants showed no overall change in their wise reasoning scores, those using illeism improved in their intellectual humility, perspective-taking and capacity to find a compromise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A further stage of the study suggested that this newfound wisdom also translated into greater emotional regulation and stability. After they had finished the four-week diary intervention, participants had to predict how their feelings of trust, frustration or anger about a close family member or friend might change over the next month – then, after that month was up, they reported back on how things had actually gone.</p>
<p>In line with other work on “affective forecasting”, the people in the control condition over-estimated their positive emotions and under-estimated the intensity of their negative emotions over the course of the month. In contrast, those who’d kept a third-person diary, were more accurate. A closer look revealed that their negative feelings, as a whole, were more muted, and that’s why their rosy predictions were more accurate. It seems their wiser reasoning had allowed them to find better ways to cope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I find these emotion and relationship effects particularly fascinating, considering the fact that illeism is often considered to be infantile. Just think of <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=577">Elmo in Sesame Street</a>, or the intensely irritating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimmy">Jimmy in Seinfeld</a> – hardly models of sophisticated thinking. Alternatively, it can be taken to be the sign of a narcissistic personality – the very opposite of personal wisdom. After all, Coleridge believed that it was a ruse to cover up one’s own egotism, and many of President Trump’s critics have pointed out with disapproval that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33943762">he often refers to himself in the third-person</a>. Clearly politicians like Trump may use illeism for purely rhetorical purposes, but when applied to genuine reflection, it appears to be a powerful tool for wiser reasoning.</p>
<p>As the researchers point out, it would be exciting to see whether the benefits apply to other forms of decision making besides the more personal dilemmas examined in Grossmann’s study. There’s reason to think they might. Previous experiments have shown, for instance, that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-012-9311-3">rumination leads to worse choices in poker</a> (hence why expert players strive for a detached, emotionally distanced attitude), and that greater <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2007.26279217">emotional awareness and regulation can improve performance on the stock market</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Grossmann’s work continues to prove that the subject of wisdom is worthy of rigorous experimental study – with potential benefits for all of us. It is notoriously difficult to increase general intelligence through brain training, but these results suggest that wiser reasoning and better decision making are within everyone’s power.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/old-nutrition-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malnutrition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WHO definition</a> of malnutrition includes deficiencies and excesses in the intake of nutrients and/or micronutrients, resulting in undernutrition and overweight, respectively. Malnutrition is a global issue, with evidence showing that undernutrition and overnutrition <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coexist</a> across lower and higher income countries. Although a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0170-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">life-course approach</a> has been proposed to address the phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition, the issue receives little attention in the older population.</p>
<p>In areas with rapid economic growth such as Hong Kong, health and social care have focused on suppressing the growing trend of overweight caused by increased food availability. Overweight and obesity are regarded as a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0161-z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worldwide pandemic</a> in older adults, particularly in developed regions, given that these conditions are highly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and disabilities. Meanwhile, undernutrition gets little attention.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1148-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our study</a>, which investigated the nutritional status of 613 home-living older adults in Hong Kong, found that approximately one-third of those we studied were classified as undernourished or at risk of undernourishment. The literature has <a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/september/managing-undernutrition-in-the-elderly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shown</a> that undernutrition in older adults is associated with adverse health outcomes such as hospitalization, frailty, sarcopenia, prognosis, and mortality risk.</p>
<p>Our study findings are consistent with <a href="https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/ageing/en/index1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those of the WHO</a> that malnutrition in the older population is a complex problem involving multiple dimensions. Among various socio-demographic and health-related factors, three of them were associated with malnutrition in our study: visual impairment, poor appetite, and meal-skipping behaviours. Except for poor appetite, the factors found in our study are distinct from those identified from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/7/3/507/4653577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an earlier systematic review</a>, in which malnutrition was found associated with age, polypharmacy, general health or cognitive decline, poor self-reported health, impaired swallowing, and dysphagia.</p>
<blockquote><p>The nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poor appetite is often reported as a factor contributing to malnutrition in older adults in the literature. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1159-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anorexia of Aging</a> is generally accepted as a normal process of ageing. However, the findings of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-017-0872-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">qualitative study</a> suggested that poor appetite in older adults can be due to the poor food quality offered by meal services, their limited access to groceries, and a sense of loneliness. It appears that the loss of appetite can be due to modifiable factors in the psychosocial and environmental dimensions, rather than simply explained by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1195-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">physiological change</a> related to ageing.</p>
<h3><strong>Ways to address malnutrition in older adults</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings provide useful insights on interventions to address the high prevalence of malnutrition among older adults in developed regions.</p>
<p>Firstly, regular visual screening and timely eye care in geriatric services are essential. Visual impairment has often been overlooked as part of the ageing process. Our findings revealed that visual impairment may reduce the ability of older adults to prepare meals, reducing nutritional intake. This revealed how physical functioning is related to nutritional status in older adults.</p>
<p>Secondly, exploring the underlying reasons for poor appetite and skipping meals in this group is crucial. Although increasing food choices or seasoning may improve appetite or rectify the deficiency in micronutrients, psychosocial interventions would be needed should the appetite be affected by mood changes or loneliness. Canteens that offer well-balanced meals for older adults at a low cost could not only ensure intake of at least one nutritious meal but also provide a venue for social interaction.</p>
<p>Our study revealed that the nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected, given that malnutrition is a complex issue related to physical and psychosocial dimensions at the individual level as well as to health and social services at the societal level.</p>

<p>A recent news highlight reported the UK running on clean energy for over 100 hours is an example of one of many attempts to steer away from coal-based energy with potentially huge environmental impacts. Energy efficiency, reduction of carbon footprint and the impact on the environment has forced us to think of better ways to engineer systems that allow for more cost-effective and sustainable forms of energy. This emerging field of engineering is called energy engineering or energy systems engineering.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11051 alignleft" height="210" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/earth-366722_1920-300x188.jpg" width="335" />
<p>In a recent commentary published in <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em>, authors from Texas A&amp;M University, present the current state of engineered tools in energy generation. With an aim in the field to optimize energy production to be more cost-effective, environment-friendly and easily operational, the task ahead to design such mouldable systems is becoming increasingly challenging.</p>
<p>In breaking down what we know so far and the potential areas for growth in this sector, the authors of the commentary introduce some key methods of energy systems engineering that are potentially versatile enough to cater to the changing human and environmental needs and resourcefulness of its tools. They discuss the criteria for selection, methods of optimization of production, and flaws in the current system of energy production. In proposing potential new directions for the field, they propose industry-academia collaborations, the use of information technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, with potentially tapping into interdisciplinary research allowing access of previously unused sources of energy, as the way forward towards cheap and clean energy.</p>

A qualitative study</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10978 alignright" height="151" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-300x111.jpg" width="409" />Banter often comprises stereotypes and caricatures, but despite its biases and distortions, it may still aid career choice</p></blockquote>
<p>Who does not enjoy a good banter? However, have you ever thought about these friendly exchanges having a deep-rooted impact on your decisions? Researchers from the University of Bath analyse the effect of banter in an interview-based qualitative study among 24 trainee doctors.</p>
<p>They first go on to define what ‘banter’ comprises and to what extent it serves to shape their career choices. The content of the banter seems to be diverse but the most common themes among these medics seems to be judgement of demand, work/life balance, workload and personality. Authors note that comments from senior doctors, coupled with their experiences as a trainee, forces them to judge how and where they would best fit within the system. They found that humorous and stereotypical accounts of specialties often led to rivalry, particularly from and about surgeons. Also, lack of expertise featured quite prominently in “friendly banter”.</p>
<p>Earlier studies tended to show that propaganda towards or against certain practices, influenced how junior doctors picked their practices. In line with this, the trainee doctors reported as “not being influenced” by negative banter but, authors do note that these are not just taken at face value but are rather assimilated and weighed against other perceived information and experiences to make an informed career choice. In line with the study, “Banter often comprises stereotypes and caricatures, but despite its biases and distortions, it may still aid career choice”.</p>

<p>As new technologies emerge, more tools are invented with the aim of making life easier. However, training senior citizens to bring them up to speed with using this technology is certainly a challenge. A recent study published in BMC Geriatrics evaluates the learning and implementation of the smart phone and in particular, an interactive digital calendar app called ‘RemindMe’. This app was designed to be used by community-dwelling seniors with cognitive impairments, to be reminded timely to take their medications.</p>
<p>A total of 20 seniors who used RemindMe for six weeks took part in this study. RemindMe can be used for scheduling <img alt="" class="wp-image-11052 alignleft" height="216" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/5307148868_bfa96479d8_b-300x200.jpg" width="324" />of activities/events, with individual reminders that require conformation of reminders sent by SMS and further more allows self-monitoring based on the interaction with the app. The usefulness and the use of the app was recorded in feedback given by these 20 participants divided into four groups, with questions on how useful they found the reminders and how easy it was to use the app as an integral part of their daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technologically developing society</p></blockquote>
<p>While some embraced these new technology-driven reminders, others found it hard to incorporate this into their daily life and often had difficulty using the smartphone, as the app in itself seems to be rather easy to use. Some also found it hard to change from their own regular calendars. In the event that they did manage to use it, they found the reminders helpful, giving them a sense of independence and control over their own lives. While analyzing the symbolic value of this study. The authors point out that “For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technology developing society”. They conclude that in order to promote seniors to embrace digital technology, they should be motivated to use it by clearly showing them the importance and the change it can bring to their everyday life.</p>

<p>Quite often we see healthy individuals asking for referrals from their doctors to have blood tests without any obvious symptoms. While there are several studies looking at why doctors give in and do end up referring them for these blood tests, there is no study on the patients’ perspective as to why such tests are being requested in the first place. Researchers from Israel have presented a study where they interviewed 15 presumably healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 50 who have requested a prescription for blood tests with no apparent symptom of illness.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11044 alignright" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Health-access1-300x201.png" width="325" />
<p>With in-depth interviews, the authors identified three main reasons as to why these tests were being requested – those who requested the tests seem to need external validation that all is “OK” within them, they seem to think that periodic blood tests are beneficial in “catching things early”, or they are prompted by someone else’s illness to check if they are safe.</p>
<p>They seem to be requesting the blood tests, almost like annual dental exams, adding the routine blood test to their healthy lifestyle’s to-do list, like a healthy diet, stress reduction and regular exercise.  While some of them seemed to think there can really be no harm in taking these regular tests, other seemed to think that this thought was reinforced by adverts on media driving the need for early diagnosis of any potentially life-threatening condition and this is often when they have lost relatives due to conditions like Cancer.</p>
<p>This study highlights the gap between what is known to doctors and what is perceived by “patients”. Blood tests have in fact not proven to aid the early diagnosis of several disorders and also do not affect progression of the disease in many cases. Doctors acknowledge that early diagnosis in certain cases is important but in most cases these tests often lead to the waste of time and money, often leading to patient anxiety and unnecessary procedures.</p>
<p>The study has substantial practical implications and highlights the fact that doctors should be more proactive in understanding the patients’ motivations, aiming to educate them about when these tests are really necessary, preventing both unnecessary financial burden and potential health risk arising from harmful over-exposure to diagnostic tools.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11050 alignleft" height="180" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/syringe-1884784_1920-300x180.jpg" width="300" />Triple-negative breast cancer is both very aggressive and compounded by limited treatment option availability. In order to further understand this form of breast cancer, and derive potential treatment plans, as in other cancers, researchers from Tulane University in New Orleans have turned to patient-derived xenografts, whereby in you inject breast cancer cells taken from a patient into the animal – mice in this case, giving the cells a more human tumour-like characteristic than those purely developed in the lab.</p>
<p>After verifying that the cells injected into mice did indeed recapitulate the original cancer, the authors went on to make 2D and 3D cultures from these cells to test if a certain drug combination would prove effective in this case or not, prior to treatment of the actual patient, and also see if the tumour develops resistance to the drug. They employed a simple dead or alive staining first to determine if after treatment with a standard drug set had any effect. This allows them to broadly classify the drugs as those that prevent further growth versus those that have no effect on the tumour.</p>
<p>They identify that these cells were more sensitive to certain classes of drugs such as those that affect physical constraints within and around the cells, but resistant to others. They note that there are differences in how 2D cultures (a single sheet of cells) respond to treatment as opposed to 3D cultures, that are more complex in structure and characteristic, more similar to what can be found in real tumors. While this system has been tested here with just one form of cancer, and to known drugs, the system and the rather simplistic screen procedure allows for potential expansion and pre-clinical testing across all cancer types and the entire gamut of drugs that are approved in the market. It could also be further expanded to identify efficient drugs against rare and more aggressive cancer types that have, in the past, proved rather difficult to halt, identify and treat.</p>

<p>Philosophers and mathematicians have long held that maths can be aesthetically pleasing. “Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty,” <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25447/25447-h/25447-h.htm">wrote</a> Bertrand Russell, while Carl Friedrich Gauss <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">proclaimed that</a> “The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves in all their beauty only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it”.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300927">a study published recently in <em>Cognition</em></a> suggests that even those whose lives don’t revolve around logic and numbers also have an appreciation for mathematical “beauty”. People tend to see similarities between mathematical proofs and certain paintings or pieces of music, the study finds, suggesting we all share an intuition for the aesthetics of mathematics.</p>
<p><span id="more-37197"></span></p>
<p>In their first study, Samuel Johnson at University of Bath School of Management and Stefan Steinerberger at Yale University asked 300 online participants (200 of whom had not studied maths beyond school level) to read four mathematical arguments. These were written to be accessible even to lay people, and included proofs like those below. The one on the left illustrates that the sum of an infinite geometric series adds to 1, while the other on the right shows that adding consecutive odd numbers always gives a square number.</p>

<p>The participants tended to agree on the similarity of the various arguments and paintings. For example, when the researchers ranked each participant’s 16 painting-argument ratings from most to least similar, there was significant overlap between participants. And the participants tended to see particular mathematical arguments as being most strongly related to a specific artwork (for example, overall they viewed the proof concerning the sum of consecutive odd numbers as most similar to the Constable painting).</p>
<p>This consensus among participants regarding how the maths arguments related to the artworks suggests that people share an intuition about the aesthetics of maths, the authors say – otherwise the similarity ratings would have been randomly distributed between participants. “Mathematical beauty, then, does not appear to be solely in the eye of the beholder but appears to have deep psychological roots,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers repeated the experiment, replacing artworks with pieces of classical music, including the fugue from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mVqAbdUvd0">Bach’s Toccata in E Minor</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX_8-nmLLHk">Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations</a>. Overall, participants’ ratings of the similarity of the maths and music were much higher than the maths/art similarity ratings in the previous study (the authors suggest that “music is imbued with a more mathematical character”), and again there was some consistency in ratings between participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, similarity judgements were more consistent between groups with some level of mathematical training than between participants with and without much maths experience, suggesting that aesthetic judgments may change somewhat with expertise. (This idea was also supported by a third experiment, which suggested that participants with mathematical experience may use some additional criteria for judging the beauty of mathematical arguments compared to those without a maths background ).</p>
<p>The researchers have used a clever paradigm to demonstrate that even laypeople may assign some aesthetic quality to mathematical proofs – “almost as though they treat proofs <i>as</i> artworks”. But their experiments reveal frustratingly little about the broader relevance of assigning aesthetic values to abstract ideas. Some researchers have suggested that mathematicians use the “beauty” of an explanation as a guide to whether or not it is true, for example, and the authors seem to suggest that based on their results the same could hold for laypeople. However, they didn’t test this directly.</p>
<p>The way we use our aesthetic intuitions could have important implications. If people take into account the aesthetics of abstract ideas when making judgments about those ideas, then that suggests that perceived aesthetics could be a factor in everything from choosing between different scientific theories to making policy decisions, the researchers note. “We hope that this work serves as a broad call to action in investigating the aesthetics of abstract ideas,” they write.</p>

<span>A professor in the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">), </span><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0278-8295">Arianna Becerril-García</a><span style="color: black;"> is also the Executive Director of </span><a href="https://www.redalyc.org/home.oa">Redalyc</a><span style="color: black;">, the Network of Scientific Journals from Latin America and the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal. Redalyc is a regional open access portal for the social sciences and humanities that indexes 1,305 local journals and hosts the full texts of more than 650,000 articles.</span></span><span> </span><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s1600/Photo_edited.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="655" data-original-width="679" height="192" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s200/Photo_edited.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>In addition, Becerril-García is the Chair of a new project called </span><span><a href="http://www.amelica.org/en/index.php/que-es-ameli/">AmeliCA</a><span style="color: black;"> (Open Knowledge for Latin America and the Global South). AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a><span style="color: black;"> – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Heeded and acted upon?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11">rumour on Twitter</a><span style="color: black;"> is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (</span><span><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge">GLOALL</a><span style="color: black;">). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  </span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.</span><br /><a name="more"></a><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G</span></b><span> I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G</span></b><span> AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span><a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm">BBB definition</a></span><span>” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina. There you can see a very strong, determined, and prepared group already using AmeliCA’s technology to sustain its journals and prevent the implementation of APCs, or the intervention of commercial publishers.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>This group is composed of researchers and students and they are being trained in publishing matters in order to sustain the work in the future.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8cOKqikbOOA/">PLOS Journals Now OPEN for Published Peer Review</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/5-690x3202-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting today, ALL PLOS journals will offer authors the option to publish their peer review history alongside their accepted manuscript! We’ve been excited to make this announcement, and make major strides towards a more open publication process, since last fall when we signed ASAPbio’s </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/letter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committing to transparent peer review options.</span></p>
<p><b>What will it look like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our philosophy going into this project has been to open up the peer review process in a way that gives authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As before, our peer review process defaults to single-blind, although reviewers have the option to sign their names to their reviews if they wish. What we’ve added to our process is an option at acceptance for authors to decide whether to publish the full peer review history alongside their work. This package includes the editor’s full decision letter, complete with reviewer comments and authors’ responses for each revision of the manuscript. Peer review history will have its own DOI enabling reviewers to take credit and earn citations for their contributions. If the reviewers have chosen to sign their reviews, their name will also appear on the published reviews but they can also chose to remain anonymous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All manuscripts submitted after May 22, 2019 will be eligible for this option if accepted at a PLOS Journal. Here’s a look at the variations of open our opt-in model provides:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8582" height="1452" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg" width="3000" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>A major step for PLOS, and scholarly communication</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peer review history reveals crucial perspectives and decisions that supply additional context for readers and researchers. Because of the potential benefits, we’re making this option available </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all seven PLOS journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other journals that have experimented with published peer review models have shown that the quality of feedback provided is at least as good as other models – we think it has the potential to be even better through increased accountability and transparency. We’re building off the foundations and lessons learned by these examples and are confident our model can offer authors more choices to make their research and the publishing process open, and showcase the rigorous review of their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the scale of our publishing output across all seven PLOS journals, we see this as an opportunity to make a significant change in the scholarly communication landscape and lay the foundation for a more open view of the manuscript handling process from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><b>Open beyond Open Access</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the benefits of transparency are numerous, we see published peer review as a crucial first step towards solving two fundamental problems: reviewer credit and public understanding of the peer review process. So far, Open Access has made it possible for research to reach a global community of readers but we have not yet demonstrated the work that goes on behind the scenes to validate scientific claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishing peer review history is a means of enriching the scientific record by giving context to evaluation and publication decisions. We hope this is also an important step toward elevating peer reviews to scholarly outputs in their own right that reviewers can take credit for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the work it describes, peer review history can also be a source of material for educating students and the general public about peer review. Our content is also machine readable, paving the way for deeper analysis and discussion by the community. </span></p>
<p><b>Looking ahead</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve developed this option in consultation with our editors who are dedicated to improving our journals, and we also committed to reporting back our findings. As we learn more about how published peer review shapes author and reviewer choices, and reader experience, we’ll continue to update you on what we find.</span></p>

<p>Hikikomori is a dark term that describes people who stay holed up in their homes, or even just their bedrooms, isolated from everyone except their family, for many months or years. The phenomenon has captured the popular imagination with many articles appearing in the mainstream media in recent years, but, surprisingly, it isn’t well understood by psychologists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The condition was first described in Japan, but cases have since been reported in countries as far apart as Oman, Indian, the US and Brazil. No one knows how many hikikomori exist (the term refers both to the condition and the people with it), but surveys suggest that 1.79 per cent of Japanese people aged 15-39 meet the criteria. However, while some assumptions about risk factors have been made, based largely on reports of specific cases, there has been a lack of population-based research. A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00247/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_969842_68_Psychi_20190423_arts_A">new study</a>, published in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em>, plugs some of the knowledge gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37194"></span></p>
<p>Roseline Yong and Kyoko Nomura analysed survey data from 3,287 male and female participants aged 15-39, who were randomly selected from 200 different urban and suburban municipalities all over Japan, representing a cross-section of Japanese society.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants answered questions about how often they left their home (and for those who didn’t, how long they’d remained inside). Researchers classified as hikikomori anyone who, for at least the past six months, never or rarely left their home, unless they had a practical reason for staying in, such as being pregnant, being busy doing housework (yes, really), they were a homemaker, or they had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The respondents also answered demographic questions and questions about their mental health.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that hikikomori is primarily an urban phenomenon. But that’s not what Yong and Nomura found. Based on the survey data, 1.8 per cent of the respondents were hikikomori, but they were just as likely to live in a village as in a big city. The condition has also been considered more common among men, and this study provides the first epidemiological evidence to back this up. Still, 20 of the 58 hikikomori were female.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Yong and Nomura found no relationship with country region, number of family members or social class. But one local demographic variable did stand out as being protective: living in an area filled with businesses and shops.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The hikikomori in the sample were more likely to have a history of psychiatric treatment, to have dropped out of school and to have a tendency towards violence to themselves (self-harming, for instance), but not to others. However, the most significant and strongest factor was a high level of interpersonal difficulties, as measured by the degree of agreement with questionnaire items like “I am anxious about the possibility of meeting people that I know”, “I am anxious about what others might think of me”, and “I cannot blend into groups”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Yong and Nomura write: “These anxieties may be related to a sense of humiliation, which suggests that they are afraid of being seen in their current situation….Unlike anxieties found in social phobias or generalised social anxieties…. our finding of an association between hikikomori and interpersonal difficulties indicates that hikikomori fear people and the community that they know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This does suggest a possible route to treatment: “By carefully assessing the types of fears that they may have, our data suggest the possibility that improving communication skills and managing expectations may be helpful for combating hikikomori.” They note that this type of strategy has in fact already been tried, with some success.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But if these anxieties are keeping people inside their homes, what’s prompting them to retreat there in the first place? The survey also revealed that hikikomori are more likely to have dropped out of high school or university. Perhaps finding ways to keep young people in education may, then, reduce the risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data also showed that a very high percentage – 37.9 per cent – of the hikikomori had a previous history of psychiatric treatment. “The higher proportion of hikikomori who are dependent on medication is also alarming,” the researchers add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>How all these factors may inter-relate, as causes or perhaps results of hikikomori, is far from clear. As the researchers stress, further studies are clearly needed. However, this new work does provide some good pointers to the research avenues most worth exploring.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomised experiments (also known as A/B testing) are an absolutely critical tool for evaluating everything from online marketing campaigns to new pharmaceutical drugs to school curricula. Rather than making decisions based on ideology, intuition or educated guess-work,  you randomise people to one of two groups and expose one group to intervention A (one version of a social media headline, a new drug, or whatever, depending on the context ), one group to intervention B (a different version of the headline, a different drug etc), and compare outcomes for the two groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To anyone who believes in evidence-based decision making, medicine and policy, randomised tests make sense. But as a team led by Michelle N. Meyer at the Center for Translational Bioethics and Health Care Policy at the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/08/1820701116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">write in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for some reason A/B testing sometimes elicits moral outrage. As an example, they point to the anger that ensued when Pearson Education “randomized math and computer science students at different schools to receive one of three versions of its instructional software: two versions displayed different encouraging messages as students attempted to solve problems, while a third displayed no messages.” The goal had been to test objectively whether the encouraging messages would, well, encourage students to do more problems, yet for this, the company received much criticism, including accusations that they’d treated students like guinea pigs, and failed to obtain their consent.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-37187"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed from a certain angle, this reaction is strange – prior to the A/B testing Pearson’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">default</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy had been a lack of encouraging message, which didn’t appear to generate any complaints. People didn’t have a problem with a lack of encouraging messages, or with encouraging messages – they only had a problem with comparing the two conditions. Which doesn’t quite make sense. (As Meyer’s team point out, there </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> situations in which A/B testing could be genuinely unethical. Giving one group an already validated cancer treatment but withholding it from another, for example, is clearly morally problematic. But Meyer and her colleagues focus entirely on “unobjectionable policies or treatments.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At root, Meyer et al’s paper had two goals: To determine how widespread this phenomenon is (after all, sometimes there’s a perception that many people are mad about something, but it’s really just a small group of loud people online who have strong opinions), and to poke and prod people’s reasons for experiencing discomfort at the idea of A/B testing. The team used online samples to probe these issues, conducting “16 studies on 5,873 participants from three populations spanning nine domains.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, it isn’t just a small group of online complainers who are uncomfortable: Based on the new findings, it appears that humans have a more general bias against this sort of A/B testing, for reasons that are hard to pin down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Meyer and her colleagues’ first study. They presented online participants with a vignette in which a hospital director, seeking to lower the rate of death and illness caused by a procedure being performed improperly, thinks it might be helpful to present doctors with a safety checklist. Participants then read one of four versions of what happened next and they had to rate the appropriateness of the course of action taken:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Badge (A): The director decides that all doctors who perform this procedure will have the standard safety precautions printed on the back of their hospital ID badges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poster (B): The director decides that all rooms where this procedure is done will have a poster displaying the standard safety precautions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B short: The director decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning patients to be treated by a doctor wearing the badge or in a room with the poster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B learn: Same as A/B short, with an added sentence noting that after a year, the director will have all patients treated in whichever way turns out to have the highest survival rate.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the researchers predicted, there was more opposition to both forms of the A/B testing than to the unilateral introduction of either safety policy. This finding was robust to multiple versions of the vignette and held up whether the researchers used participants recruited via Pollfish or Amazon’s Mechanical MTurk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same phenomenon also popped up in a wide variety of other (hypothetical) situations, from the design of self-driving cars to interventions to boost teacher wellbeing. And the authors write that “the effect is just as strong among those with higher educational attainment and science literacy and those with STEM degrees, and among professionals in the relevant domain.” So it’s not as though this bias can be chalked up to a lack of knowledge about the scientific process, or some sort of lack of critical-thinking skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explain it, then? The researchers believe that a combination of factors are at work, among them “a belief that consent is required to impose a policy on half of a population but not on the entire population; an aversion to controlled but not to uncontrolled experiments; and the proxy illusion of knowledge,” the last of which the researchers define as the belief that “randomized evaluations are unnecessary because experts already do or should know ‘what works.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many of the sorts of people who rely on A/B testing, of course, this sort of reasoning doesn’t pass muster (why would it be okay to impose a policy on the full population but not half it?). We clearly need more research to better understand the public’s concerns and how to respond to them, given how important A/B testing is in so many different circumstances (and that it is only going to become more common as organisations become more science- and data-focused). For now, though, it’s an important first step to have established that this bias generalises to various different populations and isn’t driven by any one simple factor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To mark the launch of the new Anesthesia and Perioperative Care for Solid Organ Transplantation section in <em>BMC Anesthesiology</em>, the section editors have written an editorial describing the history and role of anesthesiology in organ transplantation. They discuss the many advancements in anesthesia that have contributed to successful organ transplantation, as well as the current challenges that exist when performing transplantations of specific organs. As the Section Editors Drs. Saner and Bezinover note, the field of transplant anesthesia is underrepresented in major anesthesia conferences and journals. With this new section, they hope to attract high-quality studies that continue to shed light on this important area of anesthesia research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adhesions, scar tissue that can lead to organs or tissues sticking to each other, are common occurrences after surgery, especially abdominal surgery. While they often do not cause injury to patients, they can sometimes cause pain or lead to further complications. As common as adhesions are, developing effective preventative measures has remained a challenge. In this review, Capella-Monsonís <em>et al.</em> provide an overview of the molecular pathways involved in adhesion formation and the latest advances in the approaches used to limit them. Methods for preventing adhesions include surgical procedures, mechanical barriers, antiadhesive agents, and physical therapy. Although numerous products and procedures have been developed, further research is still needed to design new therapies and improve the efficacy and safety of existing ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overabundance of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) in the atmosphere is a key driver of climate change and there is an urgent need to reduce current levels of emissions. This review by <em>Vooradi et al.</em>, published in one of our newest journals, <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em>, explores the opportunities and challenges facing chemical and related industries in managing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy consumption. These industries are highly energy-intensive and currently consume most of their energy from non-renewable sources — namely fossil fuels — whose industries also contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The authors write that one of the major challenges is shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy while still meeting global demand for the products of chemical industries. They suggest that when approaching these issues, industry should consider a strategy implementing multiple changes with the aim of increasing process efficiency, including adopting carbon capture and storage technologies. It may sound like a daunting task to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the global temperature increase by 1.5 °C by the start of the next century, but understanding how chemical industries can respond is essential to help meet this goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garlic has long been used for its health benefits and numerous compounds derived from the popular </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allium</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant have been studied for their therapeutic properties. One of these compounds, an organosulfur compound called ajoene (from “ajo”, Spanish for garlic), has been shown to fight fungal infections and may help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. In cancer cells, ajoene acts on multiple targets, but few specific targets have been identified. In this study, Kaschula <em>et al.</em> revealed that one of ajoene’s targets is the protein vimentin, a structural protein that is overexpressed in some cancers and contributes to increased tumor invasiveness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found that overexpressing vimentin in cancer cells boosted migration, but exposure to ajoene completely blocked this effect. The authors suggest that ajoene binds to vimentin at a specific cysteine residue, preventing vimentin from forming functional filaments, thus dampening its pro-migratory activity. Interestingly, they also showed that ajoene increases vimentin expression in cancer cells, indicating that ajoene stops filament formation even as new vimentin is produced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misuse of antibiotics has propelled the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a growing public health issue. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat respiratory infections like the common cold, but they are not always effective, especially if the infection is caused by a virus. High rates of antibiotic prescribing have been observed in Australia, the UK, and other countries, and can be caused by a number of factors. In this study, Biezen and colleagues interviewed general practitioners (GPs) and parents of young children to see where their views on prescribing antibiotics aligned and where they diverged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the GPs expressed a perceived lack of understanding by the parents regarding appropriate antibiotic usage, most of the parents had a good understanding of when antibiotics should be used, and their visit to the doctor was primarily for reassurance that their child would recover. Some GPs felt that explaining why antibiotics would not be appropriate or would take too long, and it would be easier to give the patient a prescription if the parent asks for one. Many parents however, said that they trust their GPs’ advice and would want to have these discussions with their GP during the visits. Ultimately, both groups wanted better communication when it came to managing a child’s illness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organoids — miniature, three-dimensional versions of an organ — have recently emerged as a promising tool for studying how different organs function, as well as their disease states. The process of making organoids uses stem cells that have been coaxed to assemble into complex three-dimensional structures, given the right growth environment.</span> In this methodology article by Goto-Silva <em>et al.</em>, researchers studied two common methods for generating cerebral organoids and proposed an optimized protocol for reliably producing functional “miniature brains.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important step in both of the studied protocols is agitating a suspension of stem cells, which affects the mixing of nutrients and the level of shear stress the cells are exposed to. However, these two methods perform this by using either an orbital shaker or a 3D-printed spinning device called the SpinΩ. By testing different conditions and performing computational fluid dynamics analysis, the authors determined that using a standard orbital shaker with their suggested alterations would be both accessible and effective. They also found that after 30 days of cultivation, their organoids produced markers of different regions of the brain, indicating that the stem cells had matured into a range of cell types found in the brain. This suggests that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their method could be used for developing models for studying discrete regions of the brain and processes that affect them, and more accurately than was possible before. </span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>A wealth of research has shown that taking breaks is an important part of learning. Resting straight after acquiring new information <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612441220">seems to improve memory of that information</a>, for example, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">sleep is particularly important</a> for consolidating what we have just learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now it seems that even miniscule breaks, just seconds long, are also vital for learning new skills. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30219-2">study published recently in <em>Current Biology</em></a> has found that most of the improvement while learning a motor task comes not while actually practicing, but instead during the breaks between practice sessions.</p>
<p><span id="more-37150"></span></p>
<p>To look at the benefits of short breaks during learning, Marlene Bönstrup and colleagues recruited 27 participants to learn a short sequence of key presses. Across 36 trials, each 10 seconds long, the participants repeatedly tapped out the sequence 4-1-3-2-4 as quickly as possible, using four fingers of their left hand. A 10-second rest period separated each trial.</p>
<p>The participants improved drastically across the first 11 trials, increasing their speed from just over 1 key per second to more than 3.5 keys per second. After that their performance plateaued.</p>
<p>But when the researchers looked at how performance improved during these 11 trials, they found that, on average, participants were no faster at the end of each trial than they were at the beginning of that same trial. Instead, improvements were made solely <i>between </i>trials: participants were faster at typing the sequence immediately after a 10-second break than they were just before the break.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that early improvements when learning a new skill are made “offline”, during periods when the task isn’t actually being performed. This is consistent with past studies highlighting the importance of rest periods in learning, say the authors, albeit on a much shorter timescale. “These results support the idea that the brain opportunistically consolidates previous memories whenever it is not actively learning”, they write.</p>
<p>The team also identified a neural basis for these “offline” improvements. While the participants completed the task, the researchers measured their brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). They found that improvement in performance between trials was related to the amplitude of beta waves (brain waves between 16 and 22Hz): smaller amplitude beta waves in the frontoparietal part of the brain during breaks were associated with greater improvements in performance. Beta wave activity is known to be reduced while people prepare and execute movements, so the authors suggest that this pattern of activity could indicate some kind of reactivation and consolidation of memory related to the task.</p>
<p>The study only looked at performance when people learned a very simple motor task, and it remains to be seen whether short breaks are equally as important when acquiring more complicated skills. But even knowing how to best improve basic motor function could be useful in situations like rehabilitative medicine. “Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to ‘relearn’ lost skills,” said senior author Leonardo Cohen in an <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/want-learn-new-skill-take-some-short-breaks">accompanying press release</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/TBA-e1558036820109-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Juliana<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> was lost in thought. Like her mother, she had learned to support women through pregnancy and childbirth over several years of apprenticeship, delivering at least 400 healthy babies. The women she helped paid her whatever they could afford. But her greatest reward was the satisfaction of successful delivery of a healthy mother and newborn. As a reflection of her track record of success as a service provider and her standing in the community, Juliana had recently been appointed the head of the community women’s association.</p>
<p>Complications after delivery could be harmful to Juliana’s reputation, threatening her livelihood and her standing in the community. This threat was behind Juliana’s worry. In the delivery room lay a mother who was bleeding despite Juliana’s best efforts. A few hundred meters away, in the local clinic, there was a doctor, with supplies and equipment, who might be able to help Juliana’s client. Sending the mother to the clinic immediately was the right choice, one that Juliana had decided to make, but it could come at a personal and social cost.</p>
<h3><strong>Postnatal care – important but rare</strong></h3>
<p>Maternal deaths commonly occur within 48 hours of childbirth, predominantly from severe bleeding, hypertensive diseases, and infections – complications which may arise without warning. Therefore, the <a href="https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization recommends</a> that every mother receive postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery, with regular assessments to facilitate early diagnosis, treatment, and referral in the event of complications.</p>
<p>More than six out of ten childbirths in <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr293-dhs-final-reports.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nigeria</a> are not supported by a skilled health care provider. In most cases, these women turn to a traditional birth attendant (TBA), an informally-trained and community-based provider of pregnancy-related care that works independently of the health system. In Nigeria, less than two in ten mothers who give birth outside the facility, often supported by TBAs, receive postnatal care.</p>
<h3><strong>The role of TBAs</strong></h3>
<p>Our previous <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1616-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">qualitative study</a> indicated that a TBA’s advice influences decision-making by his/her clients, including the choice to visit a health facility. Many TBAs in our study referred their clients for antenatal ultrasound tests and medication. However, they voiced concerns about the reputational risk and potential for client loss if a TBA referred a client to a skilled health worker postnatally, particularly if there were complications following delivery. Our interviews suggested that monetary rewards could potentially offset these reputational costs to the TBA and increase referrals for postnatal care.</p>
<p>In the absence of rigorous studies of the effectiveness of this intervention, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to estimate the impact of individual cash rewards for maternal referrals on postnatal care use among both mothers and their newborns within 48 hours of delivery. The trial enrolled 207 TBAs in Ebonyi State, Nigeria, from communities that had at least one primary health care facility with a health care provider offering postnatal care. We randomized each TBA to the intervention or control group. TBAs in the intervention group received USD 2.00 for every maternal client that attended postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery. Irrespective of their group, all TBAs were informed of the benefits of postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery for maternal and neonatal survival, encouraged to refer their clients within this time window, and offered a reward of USD 0.70 for informing the study team of clients they had supported during delivery.</p>
<h3><strong>Our findings</strong></h3>
<p>We <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2313-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found </a>that the intervention was successful at increasing postnatal care use. The probability that a maternal client in the intervention group attended postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery was 15.4 percentage points higher than for maternal clients in the control group. Our intervention only rewarded TBAs in the intervention group for referring mothers to postnatal care, however, the intervention also increased postnatal care checks for newborns. In about seven out of ten cases, mothers reported that the TBA’s advice was an important motivation for attending postnatal care for themselves or their newborns (see figure).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11037" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11037 size-large" height="303" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/TBA2-1024x484.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Why did you choose to attend postnatal care?</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Thus, cash incentives to TBAs did increase postnatal care use. Nonetheless, fewer than 20 percent of mothers or newborns in the intervention group received postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery, leaving most clients of TBAs still vulnerable to complications within this critical window. Furthermore, obtaining postnatal care in a health facility from a skilled provider did not guarantee that mothers or their newborns were assessed appropriately, as health providers addressed only 42 percent of recommended actions from the postnatal care guidelines developed by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Every mother and her newborn should be supported before, during, and after delivery by a skilled and equipped provider. Where mothers continue to patronize informal providers like Juliana, our study shows that monetary rewards for referrals can link these mothers to skilled care during the postnatal period. Postnatal care can be particularly consequential and lifesaving for these mothers and newborns that do not receive skilled support during pregnancy and delivery. However, for postnatal care to save lives, skilled health care providers must deliver high-quality care. Therefore, where implemented, cash incentives for referrals should be complemented with interventions that address other demand- and supply-side barriers to high-quality, skilled health care.</p>

Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative).

They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days.

For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45">Teufel et al. 2007</a>; <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43" id="__tag_746041107">Siniscalchi et al. 2008</a>).  <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.</b></span> There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ...

Three examples of each vocalization were played, each from a different and unfamiliar goat (or dog).<br /><br />The various theories of brain lateralization of emotion predicted different results. The <b>right hemisphere model </b>predicts right hemisphere dominance (head turn to the left) for high-arousal emotion regardless of valence (food anticipation, food frustration, dog barks). In contrast, the <b>valence model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for processing negative emotions (food frustration, isolation, dog barks), and left hemisphere dominance for positive emotions (food anticipation). The <b>conspecific model</b> predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a <b>general emotion model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.<br /><br />The results sort of supported the <b>conspecific model</b> (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [<i>if I understand correctly</i>]. The head-orienting response did not differ significantly between the four vocalizations, and there was a slight bias for head orienting to the right (p=.046 vs. chance level), when collapsed across all stimulus types.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />The time to resume feeding after hearing a vocalization (a measure of fear) didn't differ between goat calls and dog barks, so the authors concluded that “goats at our study site may have been habituated to dog barks and that they did not perceive dog barks as a serious threat.” However, if a Siberian Husky breaks free of its owner and runs around a fenced-in rent-a-goat herd, chaos may ensue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> Methodological details:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“(1) During the control situation, goats were left unmanipulated in a pen with hay (‘Control’).

<p>Germany’s Max Planck Society, the research powerhouse that includes the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, has been ranked as the top biomedical nonprofit organization in the world by Nature Index. <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/supplements/nature-index-2019-biomedical-sciences/tables/npo-ngo">The rankings</a> examine prominent research institutions and scientists across the world whose publications profoundly impact biomedical research. In addition to taking the top spot among nonprofit/NGO institutions, the Max Planck Society ranked fifth overall when compared to all research organizations, including major universities and government health agencies.</p>
<p>“The Max Planck Society’s unique ‘science-first’ core values create an environment for unparalleled research excellence. We are proud to be a part of the leading nonprofit research organization in the world, and to represent the Max Planck Society in the United States,” said David Fitzpatrick, CEO and Scientific Director of the Max Planck Florida Institute.</p>
<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is the only Max Planck Institute in North America. Besides the one in Jupiter, Florida, the Max Planck Society operates another 83 institutes, most of them in Germany, one in Luxemburg, two in Italy, and one in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1948, 18 Nobel laureates have emerged from the ranks of its scientists. As its first U.S. institution, MPFI brings together exceptional neuroscientists from around the world to answer fundamental questions about brain function and development and to advance new technologies that make groundbreaking scientific discoveries possible. Their research is shared publicly with scholars, universities and other organizations around the globe, providing the necessary foundation of knowledge to develop treatments and cures for brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>What if you could take a psychedelic drug regularly in such tiny quantities that the immediate effects were not discernible, yet over time it led to a range of psychological benefits, especially enhanced focus and heightened creativity? That’s the principle behind “microdosing” – a controversial technique that’s exploded in popularity ever since the publication of a 2011 book <em>The Psychedelic Explorers Guide</em> and a 2015 Rolling Stone article titled <em>How LSD Microdosing Became The Hot New Business Trip</em>. Large online communities of microdosing enthusiasts have since emerged on sites like Reddit, where dosing tips are shared and the supposed manifold benefits of the practice are espoused.</p>
<p>However, actual scientific investigations into the effects of microdosing can be counted on one hand. Earlier this year, <em>PLOS One</em> published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211023#sec003">one of the few systematic investigations ever conducted into the practice</a>, by Vince Polito and Richard Stevenson at Macquarie University. Though exploratory and tentative due to “legal and bureaucratic” obstacles (meaning there was no placebo control or randomisation in this research), the results suggest that microdosing can be beneficial, although not in the ways that users most expect, and not necessarily for everyone.</p>
<p><span id="more-37159"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited hundreds of volunteers from Reddit.com/r/microdosing and other online psychedelic groups (people with mental health problems were asked not to take part). The participants completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires at baseline tapping nine domains of functioning including personality, mental health and wellbeing; then for six weeks they reported daily any microdosing they’d engaged in the previous day, and provided brief daily ratings (of how they’d felt the previous day) regarding various psychological measures. Finally, at the study end, they completed the same battery of tests as at baseline.</p>
<p>Sufficiently complete data was obtained from 63 mentally well participants who, during the study, engaged in microdosing of a serotonergic psychedelic (a substance, most commonly LSD or magic mushrooms/psilocybin, that acts on the functioning of the brain chemical serotonin).</p>
<p>In terms of the daily ratings, on days that participants had microdosed, they scored higher than usual across all the measures: connectedness, contemplation, creativity, focus, happiness, productiveness, and wellbeing. However, only focus and productivity showed slight, sustained increases on the drug-free days that followed microdosing. “The pattern of results here is somewhat inconsistent with narrative accounts that claim that the effects of microdosing linger for multiple days,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>On most of the more in-depth battery of measures taken at the study start and end, participants did not show any change. However, they did display reductions in stress, depression and mind-wandering, alongside greater absorption (experiencing intense imaginative experiences and “peak-like altered states of consciousness”). A final change that surprised the researchers was a slight increase in trait neuroticism (i.e. greater emotional instability), which they speculated may have been due to an overall increase in emotional intensity, positive and negative.</p>
<p>That last finding regarding increased neuroticism was reflected in some of the participants’ open-ended descriptions at the study debrief: “<em>…another negative is that all emotions get amplified. So whenever I feel down or not loved the microdose makes it even harder,</em>” wrote one volunteer.</p>
<p>A major drawback of a study such as this, in which participants knew which substance they had taken and there was no placebo group, is that the reported effects may simply have been a result of participants’ expectations or their imagination. To gain insight into this possibility, the researchers conducted a second study with hundreds more participants from online microdosing communities, and this time asked them to say how they thought they would change on the same various psychological measures used in the first study, if they were to microdose for six weeks.</p>
<p>In contrast with the first study’s results, these participants predicted that after six weeks microdosing they would change on all the psychological measures. Although most of their predictions were for change in the same direction as the limited changes that were actually observed in the first study, these participants’ strongest predictions were for increases in creativity, wellbeing and mindfulness (in line with the positive media coverage of microdosing and generally positive chat in online forums), but in fact none of these variables increased over the course of the first study. Also, these participants predicted that neuroticism would decrease, when it actually increased.</p>
<p>The fact that the predictions of participants in the second study did not match the actual reported experiences of those in the first, argues against the experiences of the first group of participants being driven purely by their expectations and hopes. The mostly positive effects reported also chime with the findings from more controlled research of larger doses of psychedelics, which have mostly been positive. However, the researchers also noted that they did not observe a dose-response effect in the first study (there was no correlation between the doses the participants reported taking and the psychological effects), which is surprising, and “is a reason to interpret these findings cautiously,” they said.</p>
<p>Overall, Polito and Stevenson said their tentative findings suggested several “disconnects” between media coverage and anecdotal chat around the effects of microdosing and actual experiences of microdosers as recorded systematically in this research. In particular, effects mostly did not seem to linger on non-dosing days, and the main changes over the course of the study were not in productivity and creativity as is commonly claimed, but “mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed”.</p>
<p>The researchers said that their “most surprising” finding was the observed increase in neuroticism, especially considered in light of the handful of open-ended descriptions of negative experiences. “In a context of considerable hype around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to its potential as a business tool, it is important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial,” the researchers said.</p>

<h2>Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</li>
<li>Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</li>
<li>Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.</p>
<p>Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions girls experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>
