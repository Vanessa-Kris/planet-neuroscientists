Wind-induced melting that occurred during the Antarctic autumn may be accelerating the Larsen C ice shelf’s collapse, which could raise sea levels.

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/palm-beach-county-students-compete-in-max-planck-floridas-brain-bee-challenge/">Palm Beach County Students Compete in Max Planck Florida’s Brain Bee Challenge</a></h4>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8<sup>th</sup> annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”</p>
<p>Wait…<em>Zombies?</em></p>
<p>While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about <span>learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.</p>
<p>“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.</p>

Although not required for inducing ketamine’s effects acutely, these  newly formed spines are critical for sustaining the antidepressant  effect over time. </blockquote><br />But the problem is, depressed humans require constant treatment with ketamine to maintain any semblance of an effective clinical response, because the beneficial effect is fleeting. If we accept the possibility that ketamine acts through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR" target="_blank">mTOR</a> signalling pathway, in the long run detrimental effects on the brain (and non-brain systems) may occur (e.g., <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=ketamine+bladder" target="_blank">bladder damage</a>, various <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=mTOR+cancer" target="_blank">cancers</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=psychosis+ketamine" target="_blank">psychosis</a>, etc).<br /><br />But let's stay isolated in our silos, with our heads in the sand. <br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;"><span>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/o_ceifero">@o_ceifero</a> for alerting me to this study.</span></div><br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/08/ketamine-for-depression-yay-or-neigh.html">Ketamine for Depression: Yay or Neigh?</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/03/warning-about-ketamine-in-american.html">Warning about Ketamine in the American Journal of Psychiatry</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/chronic-ketamine-for-depression.html">Chronic Ketamine for Depression: An Unethical Case Study?</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/02/while-i-was-away.html">still more on ketamine for depression</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/09/update-on-ketamine-in-palliative-care.html">Update on Ketamine in Palliative Care Settings</a><br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/03/07/ketamine-magic-antidepressant-or-expensive-illusion/">Ketamine - Magic Antidepressant, or Expensive Illusion?</a> - by Neuroskeptic<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2013/05/27/fighting-depression-with-special-k/">Fighting Depression with Special K</a> - by Scicurious<br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/on-long-way-down-neurophenomenology-of.html">On the Long Way Down: The Neurophenomenology of Ketamine</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Reference</b><br /><br />Moda-Sava RN, Murdock MH, Parekh PK, Fetcho RN, Huang BS, Huynh TN, Witztum J, Shaver DC, Rosenthal DL, Alway EJ, Lopez K, Meng Y, Nellissen L, Grosenick L, Milner TA, Deisseroth K, Bito H, Kasai H, Liston C.

The brain became a celebrity this week when Ariana Grande shared the results of a scan of her brain seemingly showing signs of severe PTSD:



Is there any science behind this?

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans. If it is an Amen scan, then the 'blobs' seen on Grande's brain represent areas of increased or decreased cerebral blood flow (C

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/Family-Practice-HERO-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The <a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0924-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently published trial</a> by de Kock, Noben, and colleagues, from the Netherlands, is a good example of something we often see in family medicine: a reasonably-sized trial of a plausible, complex intervention, which produces a negative result. In this case, the paper reports a trial of teaching additional skills to family physicians. The aim of these additional skills was to support people who were currently not working because of poor health to return to work.  We know that, in general, being in work is good for well-being (and wealth), so helping people return to work is a worthwhile aim. We also know that family physicians play a role in maintaining patients’ sickness absence, either directly through certification or indirectly by the advice they give for self-management. It is therefore plausible that an educational intervention for family physicians should have an effect. However, the trial found none.</p>
<h3><strong>So what went wrong?</strong></h3>
<p>The study was certainly well-designed: it was a cluster randomized trial (280 patients from 26 practices) and it was conducted thoroughly. The investigators recognized that the trial might not be big enough to see a difference in hard outcomes like time off work, so they also used an intermediate outcome measure that was closer to the intervention. Specifically, they used a work-related measure of self-efficacy that correlates well with actual return to work. This meant their findings should have been less susceptible to individuals’ circumstances, such as their personal and occupational situation. But there was no effect on either outcome.  And perhaps that’s not surprising, because previous studies suggested that <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/72/7/467.long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patient factors affected sickness certification</a> more than practitioner factors and that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10926-005-9003-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collaboration between general practitioner and occupational physician</a> showed no effect.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this study tell us?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest that this study teaches us two things. First, it reminds us we need to focus less on “complex interventions” and more on the “complex systems” within which these interventions happen. In their discussion, the authors fall into the trap of thinking “if only we had a better intervention” and suggest that better-tailored interventions might work. This is an appropriate way of thinking about relatively simple interventions – “if only we knew which drug to use for which patient…”, but with complex interventions it may be missing the point.</p>
<p>That is because complex interventions are mostly <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031912-114421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interventions in complex systems</a> not just in isolated individuals. And complex systems, such as patients’ networks of health, illness, home and work, have the property of absorbing (or buffering) most things which might change them. This doesn’t happen all the time, and indeed sometimes complex systems change dramatically in response to single inputs, but usually they just absorb them. The result is that well-designed complex interventions <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034222" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently fail to show</a> the neat, statistically significant effect that we expect. That is not because they are bad interventions, but because they are trying to change one aspect of something (or someone) in a much more complex network of things or people. And the effect of that complex network, or system, is usually to absorb the single change.</p>
<p>The second thing this study reminds us is that we need to share, internationally, what works and what doesn’t work in family medicine. Politicians, commentators and think-tanks across the world will keep coming up with ideas for making things better through family medicine. Not all of these ideas will be as smart as they first seem, and many will repeat the mistaken assumptions of earlier initiatives elsewhere. Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.</p>

<p>So entrenched is the association in our culture between coffee and ideas of arousal, ambition and focus that merely thinking about, or being reminded of, the drink is enough to increase the body’s arousal levels, in turn provoking a more focused, literal cognitive style. That’s according to Eugene Chan at Monash University and Sam Maglio at the University of Toronto Scarborough who, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018303350?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">reporting their findings in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em></a>, write that “… people may be more aroused simply after walking by a coffee shop. Not only would they be more aroused, but at a more downstream level, their decision making might shift as well.”</p>
<p>The intriguing results come from four studies involving hundreds of online and lab-based participants, but given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/">replication problems</a> in the general area of “social priming” (concerned with how abstract ideas and sensory experiences can influence thoughts and behaviour, and vice versa), some readers may find that merely hearing about this new research is enough to elevate their pulse and alter their mindset to a more sceptical mode.</p>
<p><span id="more-36914"></span></p>
<p>The four studies followed a similar pattern and no drinks were actually ingested. They started with participants being cued to think about either coffee or tea. In one study, they had to come up with advertising slogans for coffee or tea (depending on which group they were allocated to); in the other studies, they read either a mocked-up health news story about the benefits of drinking coffee or a version pertaining to tea. These reminders were then followed by a measure of the participants’ physiological arousal levels, either self-reported (they rated how alert, energetic and excited they were feeling) or based on their heart-rate. And finally, the participants completed a measure of their construal level – essentially how much they were thinking in a focused or literal way, or more abstractly. This final measure mostly took the form of categorising activities, such as deciding whether “making a list” is an example of “getting organised” (more abstract) or “writing things down” (more literal).</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that thinking about and being reminded of coffee increased participants’ physiological arousal levels (whether self-reported or based on heart-rate), compared with thinking about and being reminded of tea, and in turn this greater arousal prompted a more literal, focused thinking style – that is, a lower, more concrete construal level.</p>
<p>One of the studies showed that this arousing, cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders only played out for Western participants, not for participants from Eastern countries (recent immigrants to Canada and America from China, Japan and Korea) where coffee is less popular and does not have the same connotations related to energy, focus and ambition.</p>
<p>Another study showed that the cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders was enhanced by watching an exciting clip from the <em>Fast and Furious</em> movie and nullified by a clip from the less exciting <em>House of Rock</em>, which the researchers said bolstered the idea that the effect of the coffee reminders on thinking style was acting via the changes it induced in arousal.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that they were agnostic on whether these apparent effects of coffee reminders are advantageous or not – presumably it would depend on the circumstances. They called for more research to explore the implications of their findings, concluding that “our research adds to the literature documenting that the foods we eat and the beverages we drink do more than simply providing nutrition or pleasure. Mere exposure to or reminders of them can affect how we think.”</p>
<p>Readers might understandably question the practical significance of the effects documented here (for some perspective, the average heart rate for the coffee group was 76 beats per minute, compared with 70 beats per minute for the tea group), and will probably want to see the findings replicated before reading too much into them. Another issue was that there was no baseline condition, rather the coffee reminders were always compared to tea reminders. Therefore one could arguably interpret the results as showing that reminders of tea reduce arousal and induce a more abstract thinking style, rather than that coffee increases arousal and induces a concrete thinking style. Chan and Maglio acknowledged the need for follow-up research, writing “we await further work to replicate our basic effects, providing practitioners and researchers further credence in the validity and reliability of the findings.”</p>

<p>We often think of sleep as a chance to switch off from the outside world, leaving us blissfully ignorant of anything going on around us. But neuroscience research has shown this is a fantasy – we still monitor the environment and respond to particular sounds while we’re sleeping (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/17/eyes-shut-mind-open-what-your-brain-pays-attention-to-while-youre-sleeping/">at least in some stages of sleep</a>) – a fact that will be unsurprising to anyone who has woken up after hearing someone say their name.</p>
<p>Now a study published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i> has revealed more about the brain’s surprisingly sophisticated levels of engagement with the outside world during sleep. Not only does the sleeping brain respond to certain words or sounds – <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0502-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_cognitive-neuroscience">it can even select between competing signals</a>, prioritising the one that is more informative.</p>
<p><span id="more-36908"></span></p>
<p>For obvious reasons it’s a challenge for researchers to figure out what people are paying attention to while they’re asleep. Guillaume Legendre at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and his colleagues overcame this problem by looking at the changing patterns of their volunteers’ brainwaves using EEG (electroencephalography, which uses scalp electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity).</p>
<p>The team recruited 24 French participants to complete a series of listening tasks while awake and asleep. In the initial part of the experiment, the team recorded the participants’ EEG signal while they listened to one-minute-long excerpts of speech. Some of these excerpts were taken from real news reports, stories, movies, and Wikipedia entries. Others were from passages of so-called “Jabberwocky” text, which had normal sentence structure but with content that was gibberish (as in Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem of the same name: “’Twas brillig and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe..”).</p>
<p>The team then trained a computer algorithm to learn how the participants’ brainwaves varied according to the audio they’d heard. After this training, the researchers could present the algorithm with a participant’s brainwave recording and it could reconstruct the audio signal that they’d been listening to at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, to see how the brain responded to two competing inputs, the researchers analysed the EEG brainwave data when participants heard both the real and nonsense texts simultaneously, one playing in each ear (this started while they were awake and were focused on the meaningful speech, and it continued after they fell asleep).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers’ computer algorithm was able to reconstruct both of the audio signals from the participants’ brainwaves, suggesting that they were processing both forms of speech even while asleep. And crucially, during both wakefulness and sleep, the reconstruction was better for the signal from the meaningful text than the nonsense text, suggesting that the brain had been “amplifying” the meaningful story in some way so that it left clearer traces in the EEG data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When participants were awake, 60.6 per cent of trials were reconstructed better for the meaningful text, while this number decreased to 52.4 per cent of sleep trials. But the smaller amplification effect during sleep was still significantly higher than the 50 per cent that would be expected by chance had the brain no longer been able to prioritise the meaningful speech.</p>
<p>Several factors appeared to influence whether or not the EEG signal for meaningful stories was amplified during sleep. Depth of sleep was important: meaningful stories were only amplified during light sleep (stage 2) but not deep sleep (stage 3). And the effect appeared only temporary, occurring during the first 30 seconds of a story, but not the last 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers write that their experiment provides evidence that people can selectively process meaningful or important information during sleep – a ninja-like ability which could have evolutionary advantages. “In an ever-changing environment, the ability to process relevant signals during light sleep offers substantial benefits,” they write. “In particular, it would allow signalling the presence of events, necessitating a rapid reversal towards wakefulness.”</p>
<p>That said, the bias towards processing the meaningful stories during sleep appeared very small, so it remains unclear how important it would be in a real-world environment. And because participants had been told to pay attention to the meaningful story, it may be that the amplification effect was driven “top-down” by their attention rather than by the meaningfulness of the stimulus <i>per se</i>. Nevertheless, the study makes it clear that the brain’s engagement with the outside world during sleep is far more complex than we often recognise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.</p>

In the United States, </span><a href="http://time.com/5118035/diversity-training-infuriates-men-fails-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies spend about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.1 billion per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by one estimate, on programmes geared at making companies more inclusive and welcoming to members of often-underrepresented groups (British numbers aren’t easy to come by, but according to one </span><a href="https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/experts/research/businesses-expect-increase-investment-diversity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over a third of recruiters are planning to increase their investment in diversity initiatives).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, there’s little evidence-backed consensus about which sorts of diversity programmes work, and why, and there have been long-standing </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in some quarters that these programmes don’t do much at all, or that they could actually be harmful. In part because of this dearth of evidence, the market for pro-diversity interventions is a bit of a Wild West with regard to quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1816076116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a prominent team of researchers, including Katherine Milkman, Angela Duckworth, and Adam Grant of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, partnered with a large global organisation to measure the real-world impact of the researchers’ own anti-bias intervention, designed principally to “promote inclusive attitudes and behaviors toward women, whereas a secondary focus was to promote the inclusion of other underrepresented groups (e.g., racial minorities).” The results were mixed at best – and unfortunately there are good reasons to be sceptical that even the more positive results are as positive as they seem.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-36889"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company in question emailed 10,983 employees, inviting them to “complete a new inclusive leadership workplace training,” as the researchers sum it up. Out of those, 3,016 employees, 38.5 per cent of them American, answered the call and were assigned, in thirds, either to one of two online treatment groups or to a control group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the gender-bias and general-bias trainings,” write the researchers, “participants learned about the psychological processes that underlie stereotyping and research that shows how stereotyping can result in bias and inequity in the workplace, completed and received feedback on an Implicit Association Test assessing their associations between gender and career-oriented words, and learned about strategies to overcome stereotyping in the workplace.” There was little difference between the so-called gender-bias and general-bias trainings, except for minor points of emphasis, and the researchers ended up collapsing them into one training condition, comparing the results to those in a control group who received a “stylistically similar training, but [with a focus on] psychological safety and active listening rather than stereotyping.” On average, the bias training took 68 minutes to complete, and was evaluated on the basis of responses to an attitudes questionnaire and real-world behavioural data taken up to 20 weeks post-intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key chart summarising all the researchers’ findings is shown at the top of this post. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that immediately jumps out is that the top row, which deals with attitudes, shows more impressive results than the bottom row, which deals with actual behavior (though even the top-row results are modest in terms of the size of their effect). But in looking at the attitudinal measures the researchers used, critical readers might fairly wonder whether they’re really measuring what they are supposed to be measuring – i.e. support for women in the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the “attitudinal support for women” score was drawn from levels of (dis)agreement with items like “Discrimination against women is no longer a problem” and “Society has reached the point where women and men have equal opportunities for achievement.” But arguably, whether an individual believes equality has already been accomplished is different from whether they believe that women should be fully supported in the workplace. Someone can believe that discrimination against women is no longer a problem but still believe they should be treated in exactly the same way as men. These questionnaire statements seem to be more geared at measuring </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">political liberalism or conservatism with regard to gender issues</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than misogynist attitudes directly. So the risk, then, is that the training successfully increases political liberalism (to a modest degree), but it’s not possible to tell from the questionnaire items whether it alters the kind of attitudes that are likely to more directly underlie discriminatory behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arguably, there is also a problem with the “gender-bias acknowledgment” result, which was based on those participants in the training group admitting (more than the control participants) to having gender biases more similar to the average person. This finding is complicated by the fact that the bias training involved taking the gender-bias Implicit Association Test (IAT). Setting aside the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other well-documented problems with the IAT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the gender IAT, in particular, has produced some strange results. As this chart from FiveThirtyEight </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-unconscious-sexism-could-help-explain-trumps-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the normal “pattern” of IATs relating to minority or marginalised groups – in which conservatives (and members of majority groups) tend to score higher for implicit bias toward such groups than liberals (and members of minority groups) – is more or less reversed when it comes to the gender-bias IAT:</span></p>
<p><img alt="bialik-gender-1.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36891" data-attachment-id="36891" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="bialik-gender-1" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845?w=258" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845" data-orig-size="1150,1338" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/10/finally-some-research-into-whether-diversity-training-actually-works-unfortunately-its-not-very-promising/bialik-gender-1/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bialik-gender-1.png?w=845" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, results from the gender IAT suggest that women are more implicitly biased against women than men are, that this is the case at every point on the political spectrum, and that within many subgroups, political liberals are more biased against women than conservatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting aside these questionable patterns, a lot of people in the bias-training condition were likely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they were biased by their IAT result. So when they subsequently filled out a questionnaire asking them to gauge their level of anti-woman bias, were they simply echoing what a dubious test told them? It certainly seems like a possibility, and if so, should that count as an ethical, successful educational intervention? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the behavioral results (based on participants’ choices of who to mentor, which new hires to speak to, and colleagues’ excellence to recognise) were far less impressive than the attitudinal ones. A lot of the effects were clustered right around zero and/or differed greatly on the basis of sex or nationality (which isn’t a good sign for programmes that are designed to be delivered to large, diverse groups of employees). The biggest effect involved an email invitation, 14 weeks after follow-up, to talk on the phone with either a male or a female new hire. There was no overall effect, but among women only, those in the bias-training group were more likely, at a statistically significant level, than those in the control condition, to agree to talk to newly hired women than men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does all this leave us? It’s hard to say. The results definitely weren’t impressive, and the strongest came from questionable attitude measures and, potentially, participants’ responses to a controversial test of implicit bias. This outcome shouldn’t be too surprising: if you surveyed psychologists and asked them whether a single, 68-minute training could generate sizable behavioural effects weeks and months later, most would probably tell you no. Behaviour change is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, even the modest results seen here were for employees who volunteered to take part, rather than a random sample. Yet diversity trainings, at their best, will have a positive effect on the general population of a company or institution, not just those who express a desire to take part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, setting aside quibbles with this particular evaluation and programme, this study is laudable for showing exactly how diversity programmes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be evaluated: with an eye toward behavioural outcomes measured a significant period of time after the programme itself is delivered. Until there are more studies like this one, those who want to use diversity training to make companies and other institutions more welcoming have no option but to feel around in the dark for what works.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any regular at the gym, there’s a noticeable </span><a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/do-people-keep-new-years-resolution-fitness-weight-loss-data/579388/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">phenomenon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the beginning of the year: an influx of new members followed by a quick drop-off just a few weeks later. Exercising more is a perennially common New Year’s resolution, but it can be difficult to stick with. For older adults, regular exercise has multiple benefits, including helping to maintain muscle strength, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, and aiding the management of depression. But just as with those new gym members, older adults too face challenges starting and staying with an exercise routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this study, Reitlo et al. analyzed nearly 70,000 exercise logs from one year of the Generation 100 study, which examined the effects of exercise on mortality in older adults in Norway, over a five-year period. The participants were prescribed either two weekly sessions of moderate-intensity training (MCT) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and asked to log their exercise activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, walking was the most popular activity in both groups, followed by cycling, then combined endurance and resistance training. Exercising outdoors proved to be the most common setting for activity in both groups, even in the colder months, while exercising at home was the least common. Importantly, they found that the participants maintained their exercise routines regardless of the intensity, which can vary among different individual levels of fitness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers also noticed some differences between men and women. For example, women exercised with others more often than men, who completed more sessions alone. In the MCT group, men exercised outdoors more frequently than women, but in the HIIT group, the opposite was true. The researchers suggest that these differences should be taken into account to effectively design exercise programs for older adults. As the world’s older population continues to grow, it is essential to understand how to best promote physical activity and keep the aging population healthy. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0867-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>The effects of pet ownership on health in older adults</b></a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10965 alignright" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/walk-1385880__340-300x169.jpg" width="300" />It has been well-demonstrated that owning a pet, especially a dog, is associated with better health. The reasons for this effect are less well understood, and it has even been shown that pets have the opposite effect in older adults. Therefore, the authors of this study set out to measure the effect of pet ownership on particular aspects of health – specifically physical activity, sleep, mental health, and general physical health – in older adults.</p>
<p>Authors Mein and Grant used data from a large study of older adults in London to examine the associations between pet ownership and the factors above, as well as how these were influenced by neighborhood perceptions and social isolation. They found that pet owners had similar overall health to non-owners but had more social activities, less trouble falling asleep, and better perceptions of their neighborhoods. These associations were stronger in dog owners than other pet owners. While this does not definitively answer all of the open questions about how pet ownership influences (or is influenced by) health, it does suggest that walking around the neighborhood with a dog has a positive effect on health and well-being in older adults.</p>

<p>As populations around the world age, new challenges are faced in caring for older adults. One such challenge is understanding how age affects vulnerability to disease, falls, and other negative outcomes, and how this vulnerability varies between individuals of similar age. The concept of ‘frailty’ has been developed to describe and measure increased vulnerability among older adults. Identifying ‘frail’ individuals can allow for personalization of care to avoid changes or stressors that would affect them more negatively than a non-frail individual.</p>
<p>Numerous instruments have been developed to measure frailty in a variety of settings, each with its own advantages and limitations. Associate Editor Olga Theou and colleagues conducted this scoping review to explore the literature around frailty in emergency and hospital settings.</p>
<p>The found that most studies included in the review used the term ‘frail’ as a subjective description rather than as an objectively measured characteristic. However, in those studies that did use established frailty measures, they found that frailty was generally a good predictor of negative outcomes, including death and institutionalization. These results point to the need to further develop the concept of ‘frailty’ as an objectively measured characteristic, to measure it in acute care settings, and to use the knowledge to improve care for frail older adults.</p>
<p><b></b><b><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0910-4">Should older adults stop driving? Who decides?</a></b></p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10964 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/vintage-car-1149230__340-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some countries, driving remains the most common form of transportation for older adults and can provide both independence and higher quality of life. However, driving can become more difficult as one ages, which causes older drivers to reduce the amount they drive or stop driving altogether. This process of driving cessation can happen for a number of reasons, from impaired vision or cognitive abilities to low income or advice from a family member. In this study by Piersma et al., 172 participants with cognitive impairment completed fitness-to-drive assessments, were given advice about their driving, then were asked seven months later if they followed that advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers found that most of the participants followed the recommendations given to either continue driving, take driving lessons, or cease driving.  In total, 104 (~60%) of the participants had continued to drive at the time of the follow-up; of these, 13 were given the initial recommendation to cease driving. The remaining 68 participants had stopped driving at follow-up and reported increases in cycling and use of public transportation, although the percentages of overall usage of alternate forms of transportation were actually lower than those of the current drivers at follow-up.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For participants who ceased driving, the most common reason was that they were following a recommendation, mostly from the driving fitness assessment, but many cited advice from a family member or authority figure. Cognitive impairment reduces one’s ability to drive safely, but drivers still can be reluctant to give up driving. The authors suggest that clinicians may want to consider referring patients with cognitive impairment to take a fitness-to-drive assessment, as the patient would be likely to heed the advice given. </span></p>

<p>For most of us, it is difficult to imagine what it must be like to be a synesthete – that is, someone who experiences a crossing over of their senses, such as seeing sounds as colours, or perceiving shapes as having tastes. However, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018304410?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new study</a> in <em>Conscientiousness and Cognition</em>, it is actually relatively easy for people with normal perception to have a synesthetic experience (of the sound-to-vision variety). It merely takes a few minutes of visual deprivation, followed by a visual imagery task. The findings are not merely intriguing – and a fun idea for a psychology class experiment – they also have a bearing on the main theories for how synesthesia occurs.</p>
<p><span id="more-36857"></span></p>
<p>Across three studies, involving dozens of non-synesthetic undergrad students, the University of Michigan psychologists Anupama Nair and David Brang asked their volunteers to sit with their eyes closed in a completely darkened room for five minutes. After this, the imagery task began, which was almost identical through the three studies: dozens of times the students heard one of four words followed by a letter, such as “symmetrical T” or “curve A”, and their job was to visualise the letter and judge whether it had the mentioned feature (so, in the previous examples, whether “T” is symmetrical and whether  “A” contains any curves). The other two feature words used in the task were “diagonal” and “closed”, referring to whether the letter had a diagonal line in it or an entirely enclosed feature.</p>
<p>The purpose of the darkness was to remove competing visual perceptions, while the idea of the imagery task was simply to raise the activity levels within the visual cortex (visual imagery is known to recruit brain areas that overlap with those involved in visual perception).</p>
<p>Another key element of the task was that the researchers played occasional, unpredictably timed beeps throughout the task, to see if these induced a visual experience in their participants. Meanwhile, for the duration of the task, the participants were asked to press a button to indicate any instance in which a sound prompted them to have a visual experience in the darkness. At debriefing later, they were asked to provide more details about any visual experiences they’d had.</p>
<p>Overall, across the three studies, nearly 60 per cent of the participants reported at least one instance of experiencing a sound-induced visual sensation in the darkness, including: “colorful small circles, amorphous blobs, scintillation [flash or sparkles of light], extrusion [like visual pulsing or eruptions], and movement”. These experiences were more common on trials of the task in which a beep occurred, although they were sometimes induced merely by the task words. Louder beeps more often induced visual experiences than quieter beeps, and usually the visual sensations were perceived as occurring on the same side of space as where the beep came from.</p>
<p>It’s well-established that there is a lot of cross-wiring and cross-talk between the senses even in non-synesthetes and Nair and Brang said their findings, showing how quickly and easily synesthetic experiences can be induced in people with normal perception, are more consistent with the “disinhibited-feedback model” of synesthesia, which “proposes that synesthesia emerges when the balance of activity across the senses has been altered to allow one sensory modality the ability to exert stronger modulatory effects onto another sensory modality”.</p>
<p>In contrast, the new findings are less consistent with the “cross-activation model”, which states that synesthesia emerges through the development, over many years, of atypical connections between sensory areas in people with the condition. The researchers acknowledge, however, that both mechanisms could contribute to the emergence of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>An obvious criticism of the findings is that the participants may have been saying what they thought the researchers wanted to hear – indeed, the researchers did tell them at the start that they might experience visual sensations during the task. However, Nair and Brang think it unlikely that their participants were fabricating their experiences, not least because of the systematic patterns in the results (such as the visual perceptions occurring more often for louder beeps, and on the same side of space as the beeps).</p>
<p>“Collectively, these results demonstrate that mild visual deprivation facilitates auditory-visual percepts,” the researchers concluded, “indicating a higher prevalence of synesthesia-like experiences in the general population and a novel method to study both the relationship between synesthesia and normal multi-sensory processes and the experience of visual hallucinations in clinical populations.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Womens-Health-HERO-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We often put a lot of effort into making important decisions for our lives. We ponder things like: <em>“Should I apply for this new job?”</em>, <em>“Should I buy this car?”</em>, or maybe even <em>“Where should we go for our next holiday?” </em></p>
<p>We often spend lots of time gathering information on our options. We seek advice from loved ones, ‘sleep on it,’ and weigh up the pros and cons of each option to find out what is the right decision for us.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of us don’t put the same effort into making decisions regarding our healthcare.</p>
<p>Many patients can feel overwhelmed when presented with information by their healthcare provider. Some patients report that there was not enough or too much information or that the information given to them was just not applicable to their situation. All of a sudden, making a decision – something we do hundreds of times a day – becomes ‘tricky business.’<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10928 aligncenter" height="196" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/decision-making-300x196.png" width="300" /></p>
<h4><strong>The rise of shared decision making</strong></h4>
<p>More and more decisions in healthcare are becoming what researchers call ‘preference-sensitive.’ This means that there is no single best option from a medical point of view. Each option has different pros and cons which patients may value differently.</p>
<p>Thus, it has been argued that patients should be involved in decision making regarding their care, to the extent they desire. For example, the slogan “Nothing about me without me” has been on many activists’ lips. The catchphrase was adopted by participants from 29 countries at a 1998 Salzburg global seminar. The seminar aimed to develop ideas regarding how to improve the quality of healthcare by involving patients. Numerous initiatives have been founded globally to support this idea of shared decision making. Researchers, patient advocates, and policy makers all over the world have been trying for decades to improve patient involvement in healthcare decision making. Despite these efforts, researchers still argue about how to best help patients make decisions regarding their care.</p>
<h4><strong>Sandy has to make a difficult healthcare decision …</strong></h4>
<p>To picture this a bit better, I’d like to introduce to you Sandy. Sandy is 40 years old and has two children. Her mother died of ovarian cancer and her doctor told her that she has an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. She is offered to have her healthy ovaries removed to reduce her cancer risk.</p>
<p>Sandy fears her risk of ovarian cancer, as she knows that ovarian cancer is often detected at a late stage and survival rates are low. Her vivid memories of the way her mother suffered from this dreadful disease contribute to her fear of developing cancer herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, we can help patients manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.</p></blockquote>
<p>While having the surgery is likely to reduce her cancer risk, it does come with many side-effects – including surgical complications, such as bleeding or infections, and early menopause with its associated symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, risk of cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, or hip fracture.</p>
<p>Sandy also wonders whether she will still feel like a woman if she has her ovaries removed or whether her sexuality may be affected. She is concerned that the long-term effects of the surgery could impact her relationship and intimacy with her husband.</p>
<p>So, what to do? Sandy speaks to her doctor who gives her numerous facts and figures. However, she is the one who ultimately has to decide whether to undergo the surgery or not. She feels overwhelmed and wishes there was more support with making this decision that will ultimately affect her life and well-being.</p>
<h4><strong>How to help patients like Sandy</strong></h4>
<p>We interviewed women, like Sandy, who had to decide whether to remove their healthy ovaries to reduce their risk of developing cancer. <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0673-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In this paper</a>, we report on how and why these women made their decision. We use a theoretical framework to help guide our research and develop suggestions for how we could better assist women with making difficult healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>We also look at how women use different strategies such as statistical information, ‘gut feeling,’ and their own experiences to decide what is best for them. We explore what they are struggling with most and how doctor-patient communication in this area could be improved. By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, this paper provides an important step towards helping people like Sandy manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.</p>

Tamsin Edwards was stunned. And hurt. On the afternoon of Friday, April 5, Edwards had just learned that her blog, “All Models Are Wrong,” had disappeared from the PLOS Blogs Network, where it was hosted. No warning. No communication from PLOS. So Edwards, a climate scientist at King’s College, London, tweeted: Dear @PLOS @PLOSBlogs my … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/08/with-a-badly-handled-tweet-plos-angers-scientists-after-a-blog-disappears/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">With a badly handled tweet, PLOS angers scientists after a blog disappears</span></a>

<p>Political partisanship can be a major driving force behind many thoughts and behaviours, affecting obvious things like who to vote for, but also more tangential outcomes, such as how you <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/">interpret scientific evidence</a> (liberals and conservatives alike tend to see evidence as more credible when it supports their ideological viewpoint).</p>
<p>But the situation is more complicated than that, as people’s actions are not always consistent with their political identity. What determines why <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2016">about 8 per cent</a> of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, for example, rather than Donald Trump?</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300034">paper published recently in <i>Cognition</i></a>, the answer may lie in how central an individual’s political affiliation is in the tangled web of features that make up their self-concept. A person’s identity contains a range of features, from characteristics like gender and age to political beliefs and moral principles. One feature can be caused by another: for example, someone might believe that they are an honest person as a direct result of the fact that they are also Christian. Previous research has suggested that the more “causally central” a feature is – that is, the more of these kinds of links that it has – the more fundamental it is to a person’s identity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Stephanie Chen at London Business School and Oleg Urminsky at the University of Chicago wondered whether a person may be more likely to act in ways consistent with their political beliefs if they see their political identity as “causally central” to their self-concept, and they investigated this in an American and then a British context.</p>
<p><span id="more-36872"></span></p>
<p>The pair first gave 243 American participants an online survey designed to measure aspects of their self-identity on the day before the 2016 presidential elections, including questions about their demographics and their political views, such as which political party they were affiliated with and their position on various issues like gun control and taxes.</p>
<p>The participants then answered a series of questions about how these various features of their identity related to each other – for example whether “being a Republican” or “being male” had an influence on other aspects of their personal identity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They repeated this process for each of the 20 features, providing a complete map of which bits of self-identity they felt were causally related. Finally, the day after the election, participants were asked which candidate they voted for, and how much they approved of the candidate their party had nominated.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, 89 per cent of Democrats and 71 per cent of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, respectively. But the association between political affiliation and voting behaviour was not uniform: participants were more likely to have voted for their own party’s candidate if they saw their politics as more causally central to their self-concept.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, this association held even when the researchers took into account how satisfied participants were with their own party’s candidate. “This result suggests that even among people who disapproved of their party’s candidate, those for whom political party was more causally central [in their self-concept] were more likely to nevertheless vote with their party”, write the researchers.</p>
<p>And this principle is not just limited to party affiliation – or unique to the United States. In a second study, 243 UK participants who identified as British or English completed a similar survey. But rather than looking at party affiliation, the researchers were interested in the centrality of national identity to people’s self-concept and how this related to their voting behaviour – this time in the Brexit referendum.</p>
<p>The authors found that people whose national identity (either their Britishness or Englishness) was central to their self-concept were more likely to have voted for Brexit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The research sheds light on how political identity affects some people’s behaviour more than others, say the authors. But this research focused on outcomes directly relevant to a person’s political affiliations. It remains to be seen whether the “centrality” of people’s political beliefs in their identity also influences more downstream cognitive processes, such as how objectively they can appraise evidence that supports their political viewpoints.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/iStock-535171907-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1945-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our systematic review</a> found that detention had a detrimental effect on an individual’s mental health, over and above the negative impact caused by uncertain immigration status. Not exactly a shocking revelation, I know. However, this finding supports those of a previous review by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robjant and colleagues</a> that demonstrated adverse mental health consequences of immigration detention are consistently recognised internationally.</p>
<blockquote><p>A lack of clinical assessments conducted in detention settings has been identified…</p></blockquote>
<p>Research into immigration detention is sparse and, when it is conducted, it often has various methodological problems. One of the reasons for this is that research in detention facilities is severely restricted, with random sampling being the norm. Consequently, recruiting detainees usually takes place in communal areas such as break rooms or cafeterias, which could result in a bias towards including individuals that are healthier than the average immigrant detainee.</p>
<p>Another issue regularly encountered, especially with studies analysing secondary data, is that data recording within detention centres is largely flawed and disorganised. For example, <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/2/health-people-australian-immigration-detention-centres" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one study</a> found a lack of available records for many detainees, and only 7% of all recorded detention centre interventions included a formal mental state examination.</p>
<p>Further problems can be identified in the execution and reporting of detention centre studies. That is, the majority of studies do not describe the detention environment in enough detail for it to be considered as a potential influencing factor (over and above the effect of being detained itself) on the mental health of detainees. This also makes it extremely difficult to generalise or compare the findings from different studies.</p>
<blockquote><p>there are various ways to improve the current immigration system in order to minimise further harm…</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, many studies have relied on self-report measures, which are often not validated specifically for use with detainee populations, and should not be equated to diagnostic clinical assessments. A lack of clinical assessments conducted in detention settings has been identified as well. Finally, the majority of studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal which means that it is more difficult to be certain about the causal link between detention and worsening mental health.</p>
<p>In order to improve the research with an immigrant detainee population we suggest there needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>More transparency and better accessibility for researchers in order for them to engage with any detainees that are willing to be interviewed.</li>
<li>More systematic and detailed record-keeping by staff at detention centres.</li>
<li>Longitudinal research that tracks the mental health of detainees from the first few days of being detained.</li>
<li>More detailed descriptions by researchers on the detention environment in their papers.</li>
<li>A shift from reliance on self-report questionnaires to implementing more clinical assessments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, there are various ways to improve the current immigration system in order to minimise further harm being done to already vulnerable people. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting a mental health assessment before detaining an asylum seeker or refugee, to ensure that any individuals deemed vulnerable or already suffering from a mental health problem are identified and not detained.</li>
<li>Mental health assessments routinely conducted to monitor the health of those people already in detention. These assessments should then lead to adequate mental health treatment for individuals and full consideration of their release from detention.</li>
<li>Improved training of detention staff could lead to improvements in the wellbeing of detainees. This suggestion is in line with research which demonstrated that perceived support from staff had a positive impact on quality of life.</li>
<li>A greater focus on minimising the length of detention with particular importance on introducing a statutory limit on duration of detention in the UK, such as that which exists in all other EU countries.</li>
<li>A detention policy that takes into account the multiple expressions of distress and vulnerability that does not rely solely on Western conceptualisations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detention should be viewed as a traumatic experience in and of itself. It worsens the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees, and this is particularly true for detainees who were vulnerable before detention. On a more hopeful note, there has been an increase in research on detained immigrants in the past 10 years and with this comes an increased profile with the media, public and policymakers – this might just be enough to lead to real positive changes in the near future.</p>

<p>In truth, so much of what happens to us in life is random – we are pawns at the mercy of Lady Luck. To take ownership of our experiences and exert a feeling of control over our future, we tell stories about ourselves that weave meaning and continuity into our personal identity. Writing in the 1950s, the psychologist <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/erik-erikson-knew-that-self-invention-takes-a-lifetime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Erik Erikson</a> put it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be adult means among other things to see one’s own life in continuous perspective, both in retrospect and in prospect … to selectively reconstruct his past in such a way that, step for step, it seems to have planned him, or better, he seems to have planned it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside your chosen values and goals in life, and your personality traits – how sociable you are, how much of a worrier and so on – your life story as you tell it makes up the final part of what in 2015 the personality psychologist Dan P McAdams at Northwestern University in Illinois <a href="https://www.guilford.com/books/The-Art-and-Science-of-Personality-Development/Dan-McAdams/9781462529322">called</a> the “personological trinity”.</p>
<p>Of course, some of us tell these stories more explicitly than others – one person’s narrative identity might be a barely formed story at the edge of their consciousness, whereas another person might literally write out their past and future in a diary or memoir.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, there’s some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845117/">evidence</a> that prompting people to reflect on and tell their life stories – a process called “life review therapy” – could be psychologically beneficial. However, most of this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2562588/">work</a> has been on older adults and people with pre-existing problems such as depression or chronic physical illnesses. It remains to be established through careful experimentation whether prompting otherwise healthy people to reflect on their lives will have any immediate benefits.</p>
<p>A relevant factor in this regard is the tone, complexity and mood of the stories that people tell themselves. For instance, it’s been <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-32132-5_808-1" rel="noreferrer">shown</a> that people who tell more positive stories, including referring to more instances of personal redemption, tend to enjoy higher self-esteem and greater “self-concept clarity” (the confidence and lucidity in how you see yourself). Perhaps engaging in writing or talking about one’s past will have immediate benefits only for people whose stories are more positive.</p>
<p><span class="m_5506221032714862637gmail-ld-dropcap">I</span>n a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12449">recent paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality</em>, Kristina L Steiner at Denison University in Ohio and her colleagues looked into these questions and reported that writing about chapters in your life does indeed lead to a modest, temporary self-esteem boost, and that in fact this benefit arises regardless of how positive your stories are. However, there were no effects on self-concept clarity, and many questions on this topic remain for future study.</p>
<p><span id="more-36157"></span></p>
<p>Steiner’s team tested three groups of healthy American participants across three studies. The first two groups – involving more than 300 people between them – were young undergraduates, most of them female. The final group, a balanced mix of 101 men and women, was recruited from the community, and they were older, with an average age of 62.</p>
<p>The format was essentially the same for each study. The participants were asked to complete various questionnaires measuring their mood, self-esteem and self-concept clarity, among other things. Then half of them were allocated to write about four chapters in their lives, spending 10 minutes on each. They were instructed to be as specific and detailed as possible, and to reflect on main themes, how each chapter related to their lives as a whole, and to think about any causes and effects of the chapter on them and their lives. The other half of the participants, who acted as a control group, spent the same time writing about four famous Americans of their choosing (to make this task more intellectually comparable, they were also instructed to reflect on the links between the individuals they chose, how they became famous, and other similar questions). After the writing tasks, all the participants retook the same psychological measures they’d completed at the start.</p>
<p>The participants who wrote about chapters in their lives displayed small, but statistically significant, increases to their self-esteem, whereas the control-group participants did not. This self-esteem boost wasn’t explained by any changes to their mood, and – to the researchers’ surprise – it didn’t matter whether the participants rated their chapters as mostly positive or negative, nor did it depend on whether they featured themes of agency (that is, being in control) and communion (pertaining to meaningful relationships). Disappointingly, there was no effect of the life-chapter task on self-concept clarity, nor on meaning and identity.</p>
<p><span class="m_5506221032714862637gmail-ld-dropcap">H</span>ow long do the self-esteem benefits of the life-chapter task last, and might they accumulate by repeating the exercise? Clues come from the second of the studies, which involved two life chapter-writing tasks (and two tasks writing about famous Americans for the control group), with the second task coming 48 hours after the first. The researchers wanted to see if the self-esteem boost arising from the first life-chapter task would still be apparent at the start of the second task two days later – but it wasn’t. They also wanted to see if the self-esteem benefits might accumulate over the two tasks – they didn’t (the second life-chapter task had its own self-esteem benefit, but it wasn’t cumulative with the benefits of the first).</p>
<p>It remains unclear exactly why the life-chapter task had the self-esteem benefits that it did. It’s possible that the task led participants to consider how they had changed in positive ways. They might also have benefited from expressing and confronting their emotional reactions to these periods of their lives – this would certainly be consistent with the well-documented benefits of expressive writing and “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/09/twitter-study-confirms-the-power-of-affect-labelling-emotions-are-calmed-by-putting-them-into-words/">affect labelling</a>” (the calming effect of putting our emotions into words). Future research will need to compare different life chapter-writing instructions to tease apart these different potential beneficial mechanisms. It would also be helpful to test more diverse groups of participants and different “dosages” of the writing task to see if it is at all possible for the benefits to accrue over time.</p>
<p>The researchers said: “Our findings suggest that the experience of systematically reviewing one’s life and identifying, describing and conceptually linking life chapters may serve to enhance the self, even in the absence of increased self-concept clarity and meaning.” If you are currently lacking much confidence and feel like you could benefit from an ego boost, it could be worth giving the life-chapter task a go. It’s true that the self-esteem benefits of the exercise were small, but as Steiner’s team noted, “the costs are low” too.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/04/04/the-absurdity-of-drugged-assault/">The absurdity of drugged assault</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.itsonus.org/">Campus assault</a> has been on my mind recently, with this month being sexual assault awareness month. I am also a survivor… I think. That may sound odd – how am I not sure? Is it denial? Perhaps, but I think the larger problem is that I was probably drugged at the time. Not being certain makes it difficult to come to terms with the possibility.</p>
<p>Drugged assault is hard to address because it affects multiple memory systems in different ways. The victim’s implicit memory carries the trauma and confusion associated with the drugging. However, they may not have a good enough episodic memory to realize they have been emotionally or physically injured. And so they may never seek treatment to repair the injury.</p>
<p>I suspect that most victims of this crime have not yet achieved justice for the damage wrought to our physical, mental, and spiritual health. Nor the healing needed to treat the split between their implicit and explicit memory systems. I’m fortunate that I have had support and wisdom from folks in my life who have helped me weather the discomfort of living with a significant uncertainty for a long period of time. For other folks struggling with this uncertainty, I want to share a story of a time that I was probably drugged to remind you that you’re not alone.  And while I have your attention, let me also say: life can get better. But that’s for another post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>The school year had just wrapped up and I was preparing for summer school. Dorms were closed till the fall and I faced that age-old college student dilemma: where do I live for the summer, and how do I move my stuff there with no car?</p>
<p>My task was complicated by having already secured furniture for me and my roommate.  I would have to move not just my clothes and supplies, but also two desks, two mattresses and bed frames, and two night tables to my summer apartment. Having limited savings, I asked someone who had a van if I could borrow it and just pay for gas money.</p>
<p>The day of the move, I walked across campus to borrow the van, then spent a few hours driving around campus, loading furniture and my other stuff. It took several hours to unload the furniture at my new, second-floor apartment with no elevator. I was sweaty, dirty, and tired as I drove the van back to my friend’s place, hoping I would be able to finish rearranging all my new stuff before the afternoon was over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I dropped off the van back at this guy’s apartment and as I was turning to walk back home, he offered me some orange juice. This seemed logical at the time, to rehydrate after a long day of physical labor. But something odd happened after I drank the juice. My mind went blank and the next thing I knew, I was back at my new apartment with all my furniture still scattered about, except I think it was the next day. And I felt as though I had a memory gap after that. It was like <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the blind spot in our visual fields</a>: you don’t notice it’s missing until you really go looking for it. I remember feeling oddly tired or unable to move and very confused about where my time had gone. But the odd feeling was there if I tried to go looking for it, tried to focus on the gap in my memory and the discontinuities of my condition before and after moving the furniture.</p>
<p>But I didn’t go looking to fill the gap right away – I had furniture to rearrange, meals to cook after a whole year of meal plan, and summer school classes to take. I did have a slightly odd feeling when I saw him at social events or walked past his apartment for the next several weekends, sort of like what happens if you try to push two positive magnets together. The fragmented and terrifying memory slipped away when I tried to access it, repelled by the associated discomfort and terror I felt as I began to dip into the memory. But I had a routine that worked for me, so I was able to ignore the weird mental feeling after awhile.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>That weird feeling rose to the front of my conscious mind again – as it does sometimes – after reading a recent report that students are concerned they have been subjected to <a href="https://dailytrojan.com/2018/11/02/usc-sends-memo-on-nonconsensual-drugging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nonconsensual drugging</a> at my alma mater. It’s heartening that someone had the wherewithal to speak up about this problem – I didn’t have the awareness to realize at the time that I had probably been drugged. And I definitely did not know what to do about it or who to tell. Given my ignorance about the prevalence of druggings and my trust in this person, it took me many years to even consider that he could have done such a thing, let alone accept that it probably happened. It was incredibly isolating and damaging to my relationship with myself and others.</p>
<p>For any readers fortunate enough not to have experienced this firsthand, I can assure you that it is quite psychologically disorienting to be drugged, or even to strongly suspect it without corroboration. It’s terrifying and humiliating. It is also quite debilitating and emasculating. To consider that there was a period of time during which I was not under my own agency, and during which I was subject to abuse and humiliating treatment that I did not consent to or even consciously recognize, is upsetting. The experience created a disconnect between my conscious, voluntary mind that was unaware of what happened and my subconscious, subcortical memory structures, which were plagued by an unreachable, unworkable fragment of trauma. As a free individual and an adult, I expect to be in control of my own mind, body, privacy, and health. This person violated me – body and mind. He had no right to do what he did.</p>
<p>Anyway, I couldn’t have told you why consciously, but I stopped asking people for help with moving after that. I could only remember that something about asking for help made me really, really scared. Somehow I realized that it was safer to just reserve a U-Haul, take a bus to the U-Haul station, and then drive the giant-ass truck around downtown L.A. between my dorm and a storage unit, loading and unloading all my stuff on my own timeline. I got pretty good at it and mastered the finer details of U-Hauling – the slower rhythm required to drive a large U-Haul truck (never try to make a yellow light or turn right on red, even after stopping), the importance of renting a large enough truck that it has a built-in ramp and paying extra for the dolly so that (un)packing is faster and easier on your back. It got to be fun, too. Exploring the neighborhood near the various U-Haul centers close to my university, waving at the day-laborers outside the U-Haul stations who would cheer me on as I walked from the bus stop to the rental office. The feeling of accomplishment after a long day of moving.</p>
<p>Looking back, I am still really confused about what happened to me in college. I can’t comprehend the incredible level of entitlement to my body, mind, and life that this person must have had to enable him to drug me. In this country, if you want to administer drugs to someone, usually you would first go to school for many years to obtain a pharmacy, nursing, or medical doctor degree. Then, after appropriate residency internships and fellowships, you would be able to see patients who voluntarily come to you because they have a medical condition. You would then have a consultation with the patient, learn what other medications they are on, and discuss the risks and benefits of the drug. All of this would happen before you administered it to them, with their knowledge.</p>
<p>When I think about someone slipping a drug into my drink, I feel extra gross about it when considering the whole pharmaceutical angle. During college I was on and off Accutane and BCPs (birth control pills) for cystic acne and later was on a muscle relaxant and pain medication for a spinal injury. Mixing date rape drugs with these medications taxes the liver and/or brain and multiplies the risk of death. It hadn’t occurred to me in college to share my medical history and details indiscriminately with those around me, but I decided to share them here, now, in case it gives even one potential perpetrator pause.</p>
<p>As long as I’m looking at this problem from a medical perspective, it’s worth mentioning the Guardasil vaccine. I waited to get it until I met my future husband because it seemed unnecessary to me before that time in my life. I now know that was unwise. To anyone headed to college or not, I say: g<span>et the HPV vaccine (Guardasil) whether you’re a guy or a girl or something else. Around age 13 is good, but any time before college is better than too late. Get it whether or not you’re planning to become sexually active any time soon. You don’t have full control over who or what comes into contact with your body, especially not if you get drugged, so it’s best to make yourself less susceptible to cancer-causing STDs.</span></p>
<p><span>The vaccine reduces the risk of developing abnormal or precancerous growths on your soft tissues (which can lead to cancer) by helping you create antibodies to fight off HPV. HPV can make its way into your body any time there are soft tissues in contact, which means mouths and lady-bits mostly. When HPV is transmitted to your body, your body usually fights it off within 1-3 years. If the virus is able to disrupt your soft tissue cells significantly before it is cleared, then in another few years you may start showing precancerous growth that needs to be removed as a precaution against cancer. So women especially, make sure to get those pap smears regularly, <strong>even if</strong> you don’t think that you have been sexually active. All it takes is a single date with an unscrupulous friend and – BOOM – you could be at risk for cervical cancer. (There is technically a risk of penile cancer too; I believe it is almost inconsequentially low for most men.) The good news is that, with regular medical exams, any abnormal growths can be discovered and fully removed before they progress into something grave.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, the last point I wanted to make is a rhetorical question. How do you tell people not to drug you or assault you without sounding creepy? I always thought it would be a basic societal assumption: just as you’d never consider taking a dump in the middle of campus during passing time, nor spray-painting peoples’ backpacks as they walk past you en route to class, wouldn’t you also never put poison in other people’s libations? It seems rather ridiculous to live in a culture where we’d all have to go around constantly telling our <span>classmates and other people who we live with, eat with or hang out with, “By the way, don’t drug me and don’t secretly have non-consensual sex with me or harass me without me knowing about it.” Or, “If I ever look incapacitated, take me to the hospital rather than attempting to make love to my disabled body.” And: “if you want to have some sort of sexual contact with me, make sure you talk with me about it first and that I am conscious and in control of my own body during the experience so we can both be assured that it’s consensual.”</span></p>
<p>The burden of avoiding an occurrence of drugged assault is on the person with the drugs and the thoughtlessness to slip them into someone else’s refreshments. Just stop. It’s creepy and stupid and selfish.</p>
<p>I once had a spiritual adviser who emphasized the importance of letting people know when you feel wronged by them or angry with them. So I wrote this post just to let the person who drugged me know: I am angry with you. Angry that you drugged me and tangled up my mind, angry that you did nothing to admit or repair the damage for years, angry that your actions caused me much distress, distraction from my studies and life, and financial harm. It took me years to piece together the possibility that you had poisoned my mind and memory. Those are years that I could have spent doing something other than being burdened with this latent trauma buried in my subconscious, something other than trying to figure out what went wrong with my mind and memory and ability to connect with other people.</p>
<p>Fora future post: is there a more efficient way of healing from drugged assault? I hope so.</p>

<blockquote><p>Women who provided care were found to be 1.3 times more likely to report depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at global aging data, the authors analyzed eight international datasets containing baby boomer cohort data and relevant variables of interest; their final analysis included data for 16,733 female baby boomers. Women who provided care were found to be 1.3 times more likely to report depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts. Interestingly, being either married or employed was linked to lower levels of depression, whilst being both married and employed was associated with greater levels of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms decreased as educational level increased, emphasizing the importance of educational attainment. In terms of employment status, women in countries where there are higher levels of female participation in professional/managerial professions, or countries with higher levels of female vulnerable employment (unpaid family work/self-employed work), are both at a greater risk of experiencing depressive symptoms.</p>

<p>The authors state that these results may be explained by the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00726.x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work-family conflict model</a>, where women experience an incompatibility between work and family responsibilities. This may lead to a build-up of stress and therefore a higher likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Although more research is needed, the findings of this study highlight the separately protective effects of educational attainment, employment, and marriage for baby boomer women, and emphasize that specific social contexts must be taken into account when developing preventative and interventional mental health programs amongst women of this generation.</p>

<p>Do students take notes in an optimal fashion, in line with what psychology research identifies as best practice? It’s an important question given that modern surveys suggest that most students’ preferred approach to exam preparation is to memorise their notes. To find out, a team led by Kayla Morehead at Kent State University has quizzed hundreds of university students about their note-taking methods and preferences, and they’ve <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2019.1569694">reported their findings</a> in the journal <em>Memory</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-36825"></span></p>
<p>According to Morehead’s team, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11251-018-9458-0">the</a> <a href="https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf">evidence</a>, though complex and mixed, suggests overall that it is better to take notes with pen and paper rather than typing on a laptop (laptops can distract the note-taker and those sat near them, and note-book notes tend to be more varied and less verbatim). Yet nearly half the sample reported that they took lectures notes on a laptop. However, around a third were flexible in their approach – for instance, they resorted to a laptop only when the lecturer spoke quickly. Whether the students’ flexible strategies were effective has not yet been tested by research, the authors said.</p>
<p>Another key finding in the psychology literature is that it’s better to use your notes to organise the information you’re learning about, rather than to simply record what you hear verbatim. Nearly 60 per cent of the sample said they organised their notes, meaning a sizeable minority were following a sub-optimal strategy.</p>
<p>When it comes to learning from one’s notes, passively re-reading is an extremely popular strategy, even though it’s more effective to use the notes to test yourself. Over 90 per cent of the current sample said they spent time re-reading while about half tested themselves.</p>
<p>An increasing proportion of students are today enrolled in online courses where they can, in theory, revisit recorded lectures as many times as they like. Perhaps it is this sense of constant availability that explains why only around half of the online-course students in the sample said that they took notes. This is a concerning finding, the researchers said, since the ability to revisit online lectures does not negate the benefit of taking organised notes from them, nor using those notes for self-testing.</p>
<p>This is just one sample, based in the US, and the findings could be different in other cultures and settings. Nonetheless, there no obvious reason to suppose the findings would be radically different elsewhere: the mundanity and apparent simplicity of taking notes belies the importance of this activity for learning, and anecdotally, it’s rare for students to receive formal advice or tuition on how to take notes.  Among the current sample, fewer than half of participants said they’d received any formal training and nearly 60 per cent said they would like to take better notes.</p>
<p>“Given the importance of effective note-taking to memory for and learning of course content, continuing to examine student note-taking behaviour as technologies change will be an important avenue for future research,” Morehead and her colleagues said.</p>
