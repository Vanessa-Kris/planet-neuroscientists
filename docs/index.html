<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780197555767">On the Fringe</a><br><em>Michael D. Gordin</em><br><em>Oxford Univ., $18.95</em></p>



<p>There is no such thing as pseudoscience, and Michael Gordin has written a book about it.</p>



<p>In <em>On the Fringe</em>, Gordin, a historian at Princeton University, does not deny that there are endeavors afoot in the world that are labeled pseudoscience. Rather he shows that the term has no precise meaning, and that there is no unambiguous, universal test for delineating true science from the false versions on its fringe.</p>





<p>Many well-known examples of pseudoscience, he notes, were once mainstream scientific disciplines. Astrology, for instance, was for centuries respected or practiced by the most prominent scientific thinkers of their time.</p>



<p>Astrology’s time is long past, of course. So Gordin refers to it, and alchemy, and eugenics, as vestigial sciences — once regarded as totally scientific, but cast aside into the pseudoscience realm by the advance of knowledge.</p>



<p>Other pseudosciences arise having never attained respectable scientific status. Some are ideologically driven “hyperpoliticized” sciences; some, like creationism, are “counterestablishment” ventures that feign scientific trappings; others are wishful thinking delusions like extrasensory perception.</p>





<p>Advocates for many such pseudosciences seek legitimacy by imitating the scientific process — holding conferences, publishing journals and claiming to cite evidence (though presented in ways riddled with logical fallacies).</p>



<p>The problem is, “real” science also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">sometimes suffers from errors of rigor and logic</a>, as recent concerns about reproducing experimental results have demonstrated (<em>SN: 3/27/10, p. 26</em>). So drawing a sharp line between real and pseudo remains a difficult task.</p>



<p>Gordin provides neat, quick summaries of all these issues in his brief but thoughtful and enjoyable book. Most valuable of all is his first chapter, in which he demolishes the notion that philosopher Karl Popper’s “falsifiability” criterion allows a clear demarcation between science and non- (or pseudo-) science. <em>Falsifiable</em>, Gordin points out, is undefinable. If nothing else, every working scientist (and science journalist) should read this chapter to learn that the refrain “if it’s not falsifiable, it’s not science” is philosophically unsound gibberish, a sign of a weak argument.</p>



<p>Still, some pseudoscience is clearly out of bounds. And some would say the scientific revolution of the 17th century established new rules that filtered bad science from the good. But it still took a while for modern science to do away with astrology and alchemy. Later, eugenics and even ESP were for a time taken seriously by some “modern” scientists. Sometimes it just takes time to identify bad science and discard it.</p>



<p>As Gordin writes, science is not a “fixed repository of information,” but a dynamic enterprise focused to a large extent on “refuting or revising past knowledge.” So in a sense the scientific revolution did not really render the science of the ancient Greeks or Middle Ages pseudoscience, but rather just revealed it to be primitive science, awaiting better methods, technologies and insights. As science historian Steven Shapin opened his 1996 book on that topic, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">New ideas on what makes a planet habitable could reshape the search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When considering where to look for extraterrestrial life, astronomers have mostly stuck with what’s familiar. The best candidates for habitable planets are considered the ones most like Earth: small, rocky, with breathable atmospheres and a clement amount of warmth from their stars.</p>



<p>But as more planets outside the solar system have been discovered, astronomers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">debated the usefulness of this definition</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>). Some planets in the so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are right for liquid water, are probably not good for life at all. Others outside that designated area might be perfectly comfortable.</p>



<p>Now, two studies propose revising the concept of “habitable zone” to account for more of the planets that astronomers may encounter in the cosmos. One new definition brings more planets into the habitable fold; the other nudges some out.</p>



<p>“Both papers focus on questioning the classical idea of the habitable zone,” says astronomer Noah Tuchow of Penn State University. “We should extend the range of places that we look, so we don’t miss habitable planets.”</p>





<p>Some overlooked planets could be much bigger than Earth, and potentially receive no starlight at all. Astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge and colleagues propose a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfd9c">new category of possibly habitable planet</a> that could be found at almost any distance from any kind of star.</p>



<p>These hypothetical planets have a global liquid-water ocean nestled under a thick <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-hydrogen-rich-atmosphere-alien-life">hydrogen-rich atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/20</em>). Madhusudhan calls them “Hycean” planets, for “hydrogen” and “ocean.” They could be up to 2.6 times the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive, Madhusudhan and colleagues report August 25 in the<em> Astrophysical Journal. </em>That thick atmosphere could keep temperatures right for liquid water even with minimal input from a star, while the ocean could protect anything living from crushing atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>“We want to expand beyond our fixated paradigm so far on Earthlike planets,” Madhusudhan says. “Everything we’ve learned about exoplanets so far is extremely diverse. Why restrict ourselves when it comes to life?”</p>



<p>In the search for alien life, Hycean planets would have several advantages over rocky planets in the habitable zone, the team says. Though it’s difficult to tell which worlds definitely have oceans and hydrogen atmospheres, there are many more known exoplanets in the mass and temperature ranges of Hycean planets than there are Earthlike planets. So the odds are good, Madhusudhan says.</p>



<p>And because they are generally larger and have more extended atmospheres than rocky planets, Hycean planets are easier to probe for biosignatures, molecular signs of life. Detectable biosignatures on Hycean planets could include rare molecules associated with life on Earth like dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide. These tend to be too low in concentration to detect in thin Earthlike atmospheres, but thicker Hycean atmospheres would show them more readily.</p>



<p>Best of all, existing or planned telescopes could detect those molecules within a few years, if they’re there. Madhusudhan already has plans to use NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch later this year, to observe the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">water-rich planet K2 18b</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>That planet’s habitability was debated when it was reported in 2019. Madhusudhan says 20 hours of observations with JWST should solve the debate.</p>



<p>“Best-case scenario, we’ll detect life on K2 18b,” he says, though “I’m not holding my breath over it.”</p>



<p>Astronomer Laura Kreidberg of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, thinks it probably won’t be that easy. Planets in the Hycean size range tend to have cloudy or hazy atmospheres, making biosignatures more difficult to pick up.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if Hycean planets actually exist in nature. “It is a really fun idea,” she says. “But is it just a fun idea, or does it match up with reality? I think we absolutely don’t know yet.”</p>



<p>Rather than inventing a new way to bring exoplanets into the habitable family, Tuchow and fellow Penn State astronomer Jason Wright are kicking some apparently habitable planets out. The pair realized that the region of clement temperatures around a star changes as the star evolves and changes brightness.</p>



<p>Some planets are born in the habitable zone and stay there their entire lives. But some, possibly most, are born outside their star’s habitable zone and enter it later, as the star ages. In the August <em>Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</em>, Tuchow and Wright suggest calling those worlds “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ac1ea2">belatedly habitable planets</a>.”</p>



<p>When astronomers point their telescopes at a given star, the scientists are seeing only a snapshot of the star’s habitable zone, the pair say. “If you just look at a planet in the habitable zone in the present day, you have no idea how long it’s been there,” Tuchow says. It’s an open question whether planets that enter the habitable zone later in life can ever become habitable, he explains. If the planet started out too close to the star, it could have lost all its water to a greenhouse effect, like Venus did. Moving Venus to the position of Earth won’t give it its water back.</p>



<p>On the other end, a planet that was born farther from its star could be entirely covered in glaciers, which reflect sunlight. They may never melt, even when their stars brighten. Worse, their water could go straight from frozen to evaporated, a process known as sublimation. That scenario would leave the planet no time with even a cozy wet puddle for life to get started in.</p>



<p>These planets are “still in the habitable zone,” Tuchow says. “But it adds questions about whether or not being in the habitable zone actually means habitable.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/664405518/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4145243-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>On 18 March 2020, schools in Finland closed. On 14 May 2020, they reopened successfully. Why was Finland successful in transitioning to distance education and then back to face-to-face learning and teaching?</p><p>There is an a priori answer. Finns have a view of education and learning that often contradicts common wisdom (such as worrying less about the standardized performance of children and teachers&#8217; accountability) to truly serve the wellbeing of children by empowering the highly selective and trained teacher force with trust.</p><p>Finns are passionate about face-to-face education even in the age of technology-driven educational services. They have invested heavily in new or refurbished twenty-first century superschools, which create superb and highly resourced teaching and learning environments that facilitate the face-to-face and digital interactions between teachers and students. Together with a serendipitous policy mix of national, local, and school decisions, the school is no longer only a place to teach and learn subjects but also a phenomenon where the whole learning experience and children&#8217;s growth occur. They put a lot of effort into making sure that the children feel safe under a relaxed culture of interaction between students and teachers.</p><p>The Finns have invested in two structural foundations to facilitate the pedagogic interaction: a powerful teaching force and a technological infrastructure (sound broadband internet access and educational tools so that teachers can navigate different pedagogic proposals and environments). They have reduced the number of smaller, less well-resourced schools, and instead, they have established large superschools to house more resources for many students. Fewer, well-resourced schools, rather than many low-resourced schools, is one of their key ideas.</p><p>Digitalization in schools followed digitalization in life—but schools went one step further. More screen time is not learning. Therefore, Finnish schools decided to provide digital access for everyone and train teachers and students with skills on how to use this technology for learning and wellbeing. They don&#8217;t force digitalization but make sure that if teachers and students want to explore digital means, all the schools are ready for them.</p><p>Since collaboration among all school agents (teachers, students, and parents) has always been essential in the Finnish model of education, and since the society and parents have a high value of education (for example, the teaching profession is one of the most highly demanded fields of university studies by high school students), it was not very difficult for schools and teachers to communicate with parents and students during the pandemic.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated the turn-of-the-century trends: more digitalization, flexible technology, teamwork, and a focus on the wellbeing of students and teachers. So, what should we expect in the future? In the short term, new spaces for outdoor activities, more digital skills, more constant formative evaluations for students, and more strategic planning for future crises in the long term.</p><p>Here are the key learnings shared by Finnish teachers, experts, and principals during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>The need to keep the information and communication channels open and frequent among all people.</li><li>The need to bring the newly acquired skills into daily lives, perhaps with remote sessions once a week or per school term, as modern technology companies do.</li><li>The knowledge that we are living, in part, the normality of the future.</li><li>The pandemic is a phenomenon with solid consequences: loneliness kills.</li><li>A school is a place to learn academic skills and, perhaps more importantly, grow and share with others. A school is a place where one can safely fail and recover.</li><li>Teachers took a tremendous digital leap.</li><li>The majority opinion seems to be that closing schools hurt students.</li><li>Face-to-face teaching and learning is the correct form of education and deep learning.</li><li>Although the pandemic has driven the digital leap at all educational levels, the coronavirus will not change school curricula.

<p><strong>The shrinking mass of Pluto</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shrinking-mass-pluto">Science News</a></em>, August 28, 1971</p>



<p>Pluto was the last of the planets to be discovered (in 1930). If astronomers continue to make it lighter, it may be the first to disappear.… [The latest measurement] brings Pluto down to 0.11 of Earth’s mass, less than an eighth of its former self.… The wide discrepancies among the figures presented for the mass of Pluto illustrate the particular difficulties of measuring its mass.… If a planet has satellites, its mass can be determined from studying their motions.… But Pluto has no known satellites.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon-believed-found-pluto">discovery of Pluto’s moon Charon</a> in 1978 (<em>SN: 7/15/78, p. 36</em>) finally allowed astronomers to accurately calculate the planet’s mass: about 0.2 percent of Earth’s mass. Decades after scientists resolved Pluto’s heft, the planet received arguably the greatest demotion of all — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">a downgrade to dwarf planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/06, p. 149</em>). Some astronomers have since proposed alternate definitions for the term “planet” that, if widely adopted, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">restore Pluto to its former rank</a>.</p>

                <p>A coral the size of a carousel is the widest known in the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>Found just off the coast of Goolboodi Island in Northeast Australia, this reef-building <em>Porites</em> measures 10.4 meters in diameter — earning it the nickname Muga dhambi, or “big coral,” from the Indigenous custodians of the island, the Manbarra people.</p>



<p>In addition to its record-setting width, Muga dhambi stands a little over 5 meters tall, making it the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94818-w">sixth tallest coral in the Great Barrier Reef</a>, researchers report August 19 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a stand-alone coral … and we don&#8217;t see many that size,” says marine scientist Nathan Cook of Reef Ecologic, a climate and environmental consulting firm in Townsville, Australia.</p>



<p>Based on Muga dhambi’s height and estimated growth rate, Cook and colleagues calculate that the creamy brown, boulderlike coral is about 421 to 438 years old. It predates European colonization of Australia and has survived as many as 80 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-powerful-pacific-cyclones-may-fuel-global-warming">cyclones</a> (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>) and 99 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">coral bleaching events</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/21</em>), the team says.</p>



<p>Many of the recent stories about corals in the Great Barrier Reef read like obituaries, Cook says. “Knowing that these things [like Muga dhambi] exist, and have persisted for a long time, helps to provide a renewed sense of hope for the future.”</p>

                <p class="">A brain aneurysm is a weakened area in the lining of a blood vessel in the brain where blood accumulates, causing a bulging of the blood vessel wall. Most brain aneurysms do not cause any symptoms, but a ruptured aneurysm can lead to bleeding into the area surrounding the brain—a dangerous condition known as subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this video, I discuss the characteristics, formation, rupture, and treatment of brain aneurysms.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We’re famously bad at spotting lies (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/05/14/skilled-liars-make-great-lie-detectors/">well, most of us are; skilled liars are better</a>). That doesn’t stop us thinking we know when someone’s spinning us a line, of course. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797621994770">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> reveals that we take an angry denial to be a sign that the accused is lying. And yet, Katherine A. DeCelles at the University of Toronto and colleagues also report, anger in response to a false accusation is in fact a sign of <em>innocence</em>.</p>



<span id="more-43365"></span>



<p>In initial studies on more than 4,000 online participants, the team established that anger is consistently taken as a sign of guilt. This held across a variety of contexts, including a fictional courtroom situation with an accusation of armed robbery, and also scenarios involving accusations of infidelity and theft. In each case, the participants read about how the confronted individuals reacted, and made judgments about their guilt. Fictional people who’d made angry denials were taken to be guiltier than those who’d made &#8220;irritated&#8221; denials (characterised by a raised voice and less vehement protests), and they were in turn taken to be guiltier than those who’d calmly professed their innocence.</p>



<p>Perhaps, though, professionals who often have to make guilt judgements in their jobs react differently? A fresh study on 136 such people, including fraud investigators, police and lawyers, found this not to be the case. These participants judged that an employee described as having reacted angrily to an accusation of theft was guiltier than one who reacted calmly. In fact, the &#8220;angry&#8221; employee was considered just as guilty as a &#8220;silent&#8221; employee who’d refused to respond when confronted.</p>



<p>If anger actually is a sign of guilt then these results would suggest a useful clue to truthfulness, of course. However, in a subsequent study, participants who were asked to reflect on situations in their own lives reported feeling and also displaying more anger when they had been falsely vs justly accused of a misdeed. It didn’t matter whether the deed was trivial (taking a room-mate’s food, for example) or serious — cheating on a spouse, say, or workplace misconduct.</p>



<p>In a final study, participants took part in an in-person lab-based experiment in which some were falsely accused of making mistakes on a text-based task; this group reported feeling angrier than those who were correctly accused of making errors.</p>



<p>Overall, then, as the researchers write, anger does seem to be used as invalid cue of guilt while being a valid cue of innocence.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand what is — and isn’t — a genuine sign of innocence vs guilt in all kinds of situations, of course. But there are a few reasons to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from this new work. For example: the &#8220;angry&#8221; denials that the participants read in the initial experiments were pretty angry, featuring explicit language and expressing outrage. Their anger level was a lot higher than that reported by participants in the latter studies in response to being falsely accused themselves. Even those who’d reflected on being falsely accused of a serious transgression did not report such extreme anger. <em>Hamlet</em> springs to mind, and Queen Gertrude’s classic line: “The lady doth protest too much…” An emotional over-reaction that doesn’t match the scale of an accusation might yet be a sign of guilt; at least, this paper doesn’t show that it isn’t.</p>



<p>However, it’s true that people who reacted with irritation were taken to be guiltier than those who responded calmly. So until more work is done in this area, it seems worth at least trying not to use someone’s anger level in response to an accusation as a sign of guilt.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration with <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a>, a new company that is introducing &#8220;Smart Citations.&#8221; These new citations not only show how many times an article has been cited, but <i>how</i> it has been cited by other publications. This is done by showing the citation context from the citing article, the section of the paper the citation appears in, and whether the citing paper provides supporting or contrasting evidence to the cited claim. These Smart Citations have already been integrated by various publishers and preprint servers to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, arXiv readers can now easily see how millions of preprints have been cited by opening the corresponding scite report. Once on the report, users can quickly read citation statements from each citing paper to see how an article and its findings have been discussed or used, find co-citations, filter by citation types (supporting, contrasting, and mentioning), and more.</p>
<p>To build the tool, scite has processed millions of full-text articles in order to extract and analyze citation statements. To date, scite has analyzed over 26M full-text articles and extracted and analyzed nearly 900M citation statements across a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Josh Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of scite says, &#8220;We’re happy to be working in collaboration with arXiv to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings. arXiv hosts some of the world’s most important research and we are happy to contribute to making that researcher easier to interpret and evaluate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to be working with scite to help provide more context to how articles have been received in the literature,&#8221; said Eleonora Presani. Presani continued, &#8220;scite makes it easy to understand and quickly see how an article has been cited. By opening this information up so that it is easily accessible and digestible we think that will improve research itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transgender-youth-mental-health-gender-affirming-care-laws">Gender-affirming care improves mental health for transgender youth</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Daniel’s birth certificate is marked “female,” but Daniel is nonbinary — not exclusively male nor female. “I’m masculine leaning,” says the 18-year-old.</p>



<p>The disconnect between Daniel’s gender identity and physical appearance, which was apparent to them around age 4, became unbearable during puberty. “I hated showers because I didn’t like looking at my body,” Daniel says. “I just felt really uncomfortable with the idea of being female.” At 13, Daniel came out to their mother as transgender, someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>



<p>About a month after coming out, Daniel started seeing a therapist who specialized in gender identity. A year later they were referred to an endocrinologist, who prescribed the sex hormone testosterone. For Daniel, the most important effect was a deeper voice. “My biggest problem with getting misgendered was that my voice was really high,” Daniel says.</p>



<p>Before starting hormone therapy, Daniel considered suicide. With masculinizing hormones, they say they’re happier with life. “I definitely feel more like myself. Like I was just existing before, but now I’m living, now that I’m open to everyone about who I am, and most importantly I’m open to myself,” says Daniel, whose last name is being withheld for medical privacy. “Starting testosterone, for me, saved my life.”</p>





<p>Daniel’s hormone therapy is just one method that doctors use to bring a person’s body into alignment with their gender identity, an approach known as gender-affirming health care. This kind of care looks different for people of different ages. For young children, it is limited to allowing them to socially express their gender, with perhaps a name and pronoun change. Adolescents may take medications to delay puberty, followed by gender-affirming hormones and possibly surgery. While researchers are still investigating potential risks, existing evidence suggests that these treatments could have life-saving mental health benefits.</p>



<p>Over the last 20 years or so, gender-affirming treatment has become the standard of care for transgender people in the United States. That change has followed increasing recognition in the medical community that being transgender is a normal example of human diversity and not a mental disorder. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm">1.8 percent of American high schoolers are transgender</a>, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Despite findings from the United States and Europe that show the positive mental health effects of gender-affirming care, a recent groundswell of state legislation has sought to curb access to gender-affirming health care for those who want it. In April, Arkansas became the first state to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors. Similar bills have been proposed in more than a dozen other states. Although several of those proposals failed — and a federal judge blocked the Arkansas law in July — they may still exact a mental health toll on many transgender youth, experts say.</p>



<p>“Even if the bills don’t pass, even if they die in committee, the damage is being done,” says Jason Klein, a pediatric endocrinologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. “Many people across this country are already going to be hurt just by the ideas being put out by these bills.”</p>

<p>Proponents of health care restrictions for transgender youth say they want to protect children from life-altering procedures they may later regret, as well as medical risks, which may include impacts on fertility and bone health. But the <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-speaks-out-against-bills-harming-transgender-youth/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and the <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2021/endocrine-society-condemns-efforts-to-block-access-to-medical-care-for-transgender-youth">Endocrine Society</a> have endorsed gender-affirming care, arguing that the restrictions would endanger a population already at severe risk of depression and self-harm.</p>



<p>Transgender youth are three to four times as likely as their peers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/transgender-children-are-greater-risk-mental-health-problems">to have depression or anxiety</a> (<em>SN Online: 3/1/17</em>). Among 13,600 transgender and nonbinary youth who participated in a national survey in 2020, 52 percent had considered suicide in the previous year, and 21 percent had attempted it.</p>



<p>Gender-affirming health care could improve those alarming statistics across age groups, says Jack Turban, a child and adolescent psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine. “All existing research suggests that gender-affirming medical interventions improve the mental health of transgender youth.”</p>



<h4>Transitioning in childhood</h4>



<p>For children who haven’t yet started puberty, gender-affirming health care involves no medical treatments. It entails parents and doctors supporting a child through a social transition. This may mean calling the child by a new name, using the pronouns that fit their gender identity and allowing the child to dress or wear their hair however feels most authentic to them.</p>



<p>Mental health care professionals can help families through this process. “Sometimes, the kids need more conversation and time to think about their gender identity and their goals for themselves,” Klein says. “Sometimes, the parents need that — the kids are very solid and steady and know exactly who they are, and the parents might need some time to kind of adjust.”</p>

<p>Being supported through a social transition appears to boost young people’s mental health. Levels of depression and self-worth reported by more than 100 socially transitioned transgender children from across the United States and Canada were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856716319414#!">about the same as for their nontransgender, or cisgender, siblings and peers</a>, researchers reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em>. Transgender kids who have not socially transitioned, on the other hand, have historically shown high levels of depression.</p>



<p>Opponents of gender-affirming health care have cited studies suggesting that as many as 80 percent of people who identify as transgender in early childhood will not continue to do so when they grow up. But others have pointed out that those studies included many children who may have been considered transgender based on outdated and overly broad criteria, thus skewing the results. Researchers are still investigating how gender identity evolves with age.</p>



<p>“We have to be honest. We don’t know so much about it,” says Annelou de Vries, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Thus, nonpermanent gender-affirming treatment options may allow children time to safely explore their identity as they approach adolescence, proponents say.</p>



<h4>Pausing puberty</h4>



<p>At the start of puberty, children who are transgender or questioning their gender identity may begin taking medications that suppress the natural release of estrogen and testosterone, sex hormones that cause the body to change. Such puberty blockers can be taken through an injection once a month or every few months, or through a small implant inserted in the upper arm and replaced annually.</p>



<p>“These medications are fully reversible,” says Russell Toomey, a family studies and human development researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson. When someone stops taking them, the body picks up where it left off and proceeds through puberty.</p>



<p>Delaying puberty allows transgender children to go through their early teenage years without experiencing potentially distressing body changes not aligned with their gender identity, Toomey says. For adolescents who later receive hormones, puberty blockers can limit the development of physical features such as breasts that would require surgery to change later.</p>



<p>Puberty blockers are among the gender-affirming treatments forbidden by the latest bills. But these medications are not new and are not just for transgender youth. They have been used for decades to treat children who start showing signs of puberty before age 8 or 9, a condition known as precocious puberty. For transgender youth, these time-tested medications can be a lifeline. Transgender adolescents who had access to puberty blockers <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/2/e20191725?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=3&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token">were 70 percent less likely to consider suicide</a> than those who could not get the medications, according to a 2020 study in <em>Pediatrics</em>. Of the more than 20,000 U.S. transgender adults surveyed, nearly 17 percent had wanted puberty blockers while growing up, but just 2.5 percent of them received the medications.</p>



<p>Youth who visited a gender identity clinic but hadn’t started treatment had more emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, and suicidal tendencies than their cisgender peers, a study of 1,100 youth in the Netherlands found. In contrast, children receiving puberty blockers at that clinic <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30027-6/fulltext">showed similar or better psychological functioning</a> than cisgender kids, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Closer to OK&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Emotional problems, such as depression or anxiety, that would qualify for mental health care were much more common among transgender teens who had not been treated with puberty blockers than among those who had received those medications, in a study of Dutch youth. Similarly, a higher percentage of transgender teens who had not received puberty blockers expressed suicidal thoughts than trans peers who had received the medications and than cisgender, or nontransgender, teens. </p>



<h6>Differences in mental health among Dutch adolescents</h6>

<p>Daniel wishes they’d had the opportunity to take the medications. “I really do believe if I’d been on [puberty] blockers, things would have been a lot easier for me,” Daniel says. “I would have still struggled, but it would have been easier to handle.”</p>



<p>One possible side effect of puberty blockers is delayed bone development. The medications interrupt the rapid buildup in bone density that generally occurs during puberty, potentially leading to weaker bones in adulthood. But long-term data from people treated for precocious puberty suggest that bone development catches up once people stop taking puberty blockers.</p>



<p>Likewise, early data on transgender youth indicate that hormone therapy helps bone growth catch up once teens stop taking puberty blockers, de Vries says. Long-term data don’t yet exist to comprehensively assess the impacts in transgender adults.</p>



<p>To be safe, Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who practices pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, gives special instructions to her patients starting puberty blockers. “We have them take vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and we stress the importance of weight-bearing exercise, which is critical for shoring up bone density.”</p>



<h4>Reversible and not</h4>



<p>Older transgender adolescents can start taking gender-affirming hormones, as Daniel did. A new law in Tennessee bans such hormones for prepubescent children. Yet current medical guidelines do not recommend hormone therapy earlier than about age 14 to 16.</p>



<p>Masculinizing hormone therapy involves taking testosterone to promote changes like voice deepening and facial hair growth, while suppressing menstruation and breast development. Daniel takes testosterone through injections, but the hormone can also be absorbed via skin ointment or a patch.</p>



<p>Feminizing hormone therapy involves taking estrogen through a pill, patch or injection, often with a separate drug to block the body’s natural testosterone. This causes breast development, slows body hair growth and decreases muscle mass. Some effects of hormone therapy, such as facial hair growth, voice deepening and breast development, are permanent, whereas changes in muscle mass and fat distribution are reversible if treatment stops.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Body changes&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Transgender teens about 14 to 16 years old may start taking the masculinizing hormone testosterone or the feminizing hormone estrogen to promote body changes that align with their gender identity.</p>

<p>Twenty-one out of 47 transgender youth in a study at a Missouri children’s hospital expressed suicidal tendencies before starting hormone therapy, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-52280-009">while six did after treatment</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology</em>. Another study at a Texas clinic found that 86 transgender teens on hormone therapy surveyed were <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/4/e20193006">happier with their bodies</a> after about one year of treatment than they were before, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Pediatrics</em>. On a body dissatisfaction scale from 0 (none) to 116 (highest dissatisfaction), teens’ self-reported ratings fell 20 points on average, from about 71 before treatment to about 51 afterward.</p>



<p>While studies like these and many others on the mental health effects of gender-affirming health care are small, taken together they suggest the treatments have a positive impact, even as research efforts continue, says Lauren Beach, a sexual and gender minority health researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “When we consider the incredibly heightened risk that trans youth face for suicide in general, those studies are incredibly compelling.”</p>

<p>Hormone therapy is generally considered safe, but it’s not risk-free. Testosterone and estrogen can both affect fertility, but the effects vary from person to person. People who want to preserve their fertility can freeze eggs or bank sperm before starting gender-affirming hormones — although adolescents who have taken puberty blockers may be less likely than those who have gone through uninterrupted puberty to produce viable eggs or sperm.</p>



<p>“In my experience, most people do not pursue fertility preservation techniques — whether that’s because of their own wants or needs, or because of financial constraints, insurance constraints [or] time constraints,” Klein says. Recent research echoes that observation. At one clinic, of 72 transgender adolescents <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X16309582">counseled on fertility preservation options</a>, just two used them, researchers reported in 2017 in the<em> Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<p>Transgender individuals taking hormones may have a higher-than-before risk of common gender-associated diseases. For example, trans women who take estrogen may be at higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, but not higher risk than other women, says Joshua Safer, who directs the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York City. Trans women who take estrogen also have a slight risk of developing blood clots, but not higher than cisgender women’s risk of developing blood clots from taking estrogen-containing birth control. Transgender men taking testosterone may, like other men, have a higher risk of high cholesterol, Safer says, but existing data cannot say for sure.</p>



<p>Beyond hormone therapy, gender-affirming treatment can involve surgery for some transgender people. Current medical guidelines do not recommend genital surgery for minors, but some adolescents may have masculinizing chest surgery if they experience severe distress or discomfort from unwanted breast development. “This is a major decision that requires careful coordination between a family and their physicians,” Turban says.</p>



<p>Like other aspects of gender-affirming health care, surgery has been shown to improve mental health and quality of life for many. All but one of 58 individuals who had masculinizing chest surgery reported the procedure had an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30286047/">overall positive impact on their lives</a> in a survey published in <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em> in 2019.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Right timing&nbsp;</h3>



<p>For young children, gender-affirming health care is limited to providing support through a change in name and pronouns and clothing style, but no medication. Older adolescents may receive medical treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery, if appropriate.</p>

</div>



<h4>Risk of regret</h4>



<p>Medical guidelines recommend that every stage of gender affirmation, from social transition to surgery, involves extensive conversations among children and their parents, physicians and mental health care providers — and informed consent from both adolescents and their parents for any medical procedures. “It’s not that you decide on your 12th birthday where you are when you’re 21,” de Vries says.</p>



<p>Some lawmakers who have pushed bills to ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors have argued that children who receive gender-affirming treatment may regret it when they grow up. Regret is a risk. But current research says that regret following gender-affirming medical and surgical care is rare, Turban says.</p>



<p>One team tracked the development of 55 transgender adults in the Netherlands who received puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones in adolescence, followed by transition-related surgery in early adulthood. After surgery, participants had similar quality of life and happiness as their cisgender peers. All were satisfied with their appearance and <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696">none regretted treatment</a>, according to a 2014 report in <em>Pediatrics</em>. A recent review of more than two dozen studies that include nearly 8,000 transgender patients who had gender-affirming surgeries similarly <a href="https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret_after_gender_affirmation_surgery__a.22.aspx">showed that only about 1 percent regretted treatment</a>, researchers reported in March in<em> Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery-Global Open</em>.</p>



<p>A small percentage of people do choose to discontinue therapy. Among more than 800 adolescents who visited a gender identity clinic in the Netherlands over a 40-year period from 1972 to 2015, 1.9 percent of those who started taking puberty blockers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/">did not proceed with hormone therapy</a>, researchers reported in 2018 in the<em> Journal of Sexual Medicine</em>. And some adults who undergo gender-affirming treatments later decide to return to living as the gender assigned to them at birth, a process called detransitioning.</p>



<p>In a survey of nearly 28,000 transgender adults in the United States, about 2,200 had detransitioned. About 36 percent cited pressure from parents as a reason. Close to 33 percent reported pressure from community and 27 percent said they had trouble getting a job. Just under 11 percent said that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794108/">fluctuations in their gender factored into their detransition</a>, Turban and colleagues report in the June<em> LGBT Health</em>.</p>





<h4>Legal ramifications</h4>



<p>Legislation aiming to restrict gender-affirming health care may have more widespread consequences than preventing minors in some states from receiving treatment. Bills that portray gender-affirming health care as experimental or dangerous may make people who are questioning their gender reluctant to ask for help, Klein says. The bills may also make parents reluctant to seek help for their children even in places where treatment has not been made illegal.</p>



<p>These health care bills are just one aspect of a wave of legislation that some LGBTQ advocates say discriminates against the transgender community. A new law passed in Tennessee, but temporarily halted by a federal judge, requires businesses and government facilities to post signs if they allow transgender people to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. And several states, including Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee, now forbid transgender kids from playing on sports teams that match their gender identity. In late July, a federal judge prevented West Virginia from enforcing its sports ban.</p>

</div>



<p>“We know that a major driver of mental health problems among transgender youth is rejection of their gender identity,” Turban says. “Imagine that you heard powerful politicians pronouncing on the national stage that you’re confused, invalid and dangerous to people in bathrooms and sports leagues. It’s extraordinarily difficult for a child not to be negatively impacted by this rhetoric.”</p>



<p>Research is just emerging on how recent anti-trans legislation may affect transgender youth and their families. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350306037_I_am_afraid_for_those_kids_who_might_find_death_preferable_Parental_Figures'_Reactions_and_Coping_Strategies_to_Bans_on_Gender_Affirming_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse_Youth">Parents of transgender children expressed anxiety about the increased stigma their kids may face</a>, and the potential health impacts of lack of access to gender-affirming care, according to a small online survey published on July 29 in <em>Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity</em>. “I am afraid for those kids who might find death preferable to being forced to go through the bodily changes of puberty for the wrong gender,” says a Texas mother quoted in the study.</p>



<p>Daniel can relate. “It’s frustrating. It angers me,” they say. “But it’s also so confusing, because what is the point of stopping people from being who they are, and doing things that could possibly save their life?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/female-hummingbird-flashy-feathers-males-harassment-attacks">Female hummingbirds may sport flashy feathers to avoid being harassed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some female hummingbirds don flashy feathers to avoid being bothered by other hummingbirds, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Male white-necked jacobin hummingbirds (<em>Florisuga mellivora</em>) have bright blue heads and throats. Females tend to have more drab hues, but some sport the blue coloring too. Appearing fit and fine to impress potential mates can often explain animals’ vibrant colors. But mate choice doesn’t seem to drive these females’ pretty plumage since males don’t appear to prefer the blue females. Instead, bright colors <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01033-2">may help lady birds blend in with the guys, and as a result, feed for longer without harassment</a> from other hummingbirds, researchers report August 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond vying for mates, animals often also compete for territory, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/piggybacking-tadpoles-are-epic-food-beggars">parental attention</a>, social ranks and food (<em>SN: 4/7/16</em>). Mating choices don’t capture all those other interactions and can’t always explain animals’ looks, says Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>To begin investigating why some female jacobins have colorful blue plumage, Falk and colleagues captured and released over 400 of the birds in Gamboa, Panama, using genetics to determine their sex. Most females had drab colors — olive green heads and backs and mottled throats. But nearly 30 percent of females had the shimmery blue noggins that all juveniles have and that are characteristic of adult males.</p>



<p>These birds develop the bright colors in their adolescence, when the birds aren’t yet looking for mates, and for some lady hummers, the colors persist into adulthood when most females drop the bright colors. If these colors in females were driven by mate choice, then this is “the exact opposite of what you would expect,” says Falk, who did the work while at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="294" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of a female bird with normal coloration, a male bird with a blue head and throat and a juvenile bird with a blue head and a peach throat" class="wp-image-3103061" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1-330x143.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103061">Female white-necked jacobins (one illustrated at left) typically have a drab, olive green head and back, paired with a mottled throat. But about 30 percent of females have shiny blue heads and throats and look similar to adult males (center) as well as juveniles of both sexes (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103061">Jillian Ditner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In another experiment, the team set a taxidermy bird that was either a drab female, male or a blue-headed female at each of a pair of hummingbird feeders and compared how live birds reacted to the stuffed dummies. Male birds seemed to prefer drab-looking females, sometimes performing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/costas-hummingbirds-singing-tail-feathers">swooping courtship dives</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). Visitors to the feeders more frequently attempted to mate with green female body doubles than males or females with male-mimicking blue coloration.</p>



<p>White-necked jacobins can also be very aggressive, Falk says. Personality-wise, they’re “like the show-off jocks of the hummingbird world.” At the feeders, preserved females with dull green hues more frequently endured attacks when the feeder next door featured a stuffed male or a blue-colored female. Harassment came not only from jacobins but also from other hummingbird species, suggesting an even greater benefit of bright colors. “It’s really cool that these other species are paying attention to the differences between males and females,” Falk says.</p>





<p>The researchers next implanted tiny tracking tags into wild birds so that the team could tally up birds’ time at feeders that detected the tags. Brightly colored females made more visits to feeders, particularly ones with more sugary nectar, and spent more time there than their muted counterparts, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Being able to fly under the radar and eat in peace more frequently may make the brighter female birds more fit than other females. “Hummingbirds have the highest metabolic rate of any vertebrate on Earth,” says Ola Fincke, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman who was not part of the study. Greater access to better food could make those animals healthier, though the new study looked only at hummingbird feeders, and it’s not clear whether the same trend would apply to foraging from flowers in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though it’s not clear yet what drives such feather finery — whether genetics, hormones or something else — this is an “exciting example” of an evolved trait that helps females blend in with males to avoid harassment, says Sara Lipshutz, an evolutionary biologist at Loyola University Chicago who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>The study also helps put the focus on female birds, which haven’t garnered as much research attention as males. For a long time, Lipshutz says, researchers “have been ignoring females — 50 percent of vertebrate animals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-surfing-shock-wave-physics-particle-laser">Physicists caught protons ‘surfing’ on shock waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons can surf some truly gnarly waves.</p>



<p>A new experiment suggests that the subatomic particles can be accelerated by a process akin to surfers catching waves. The protons get a speed boost not from ocean swells, but from shock waves within plasma, a mixture of electrically charged particles. Such shock waves are sonic boom–like disturbances marked by an abrupt increase in density, temperature and pressure.</p>



<p>The research could help scientists better understand some of the high-energy particles that zip through the cosmos. Shock waves in space are thought to propel charged particles, but it’s still not fully understood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-death-giant-lasers-explosive-mysterious-physics">how particles get their pep</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>In the experiment, which mimicked certain types of cosmic shock waves, protons reached energies up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01325-w">80,000 electron volts</a>, physicists report August 19 in <em>Nature Physics</em>. In space, similar shock waves occur where the outflow of charged particles from the sun meets the Earth’s magnetic field, for example, and also where those particles slow down dramatically as they approach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/voyagers-view">the edge of the solar system</a>, at what’s called the termination shock (<em>SN: 10/4/13</em>).</p>





<p>The scientists used powerful lasers to re-create the physics of such cosmic shock waves on a smaller scale. In the experiment, a laser blast vaporized a target, sending a burst of plasma careening into a cloud of hydrogen gas. As the plasma plowed through the gas, a shock wave formed, and protons from the gas sped up, measurements indicated.</p>



<p>Scientists had predicted that protons could be accelerated by a process called the shock surfing acceleration, which happens in the presence of a magnetic field. A particle is pushed along by the shock wave’s electric field, and the magnetic field helps the particle stay on course. If the particle glides away from the shock wave, the magnetic field twists the particle’s trajectory to return it to the wave, so the proton can surf again.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no such automatic return for human surfers, says Julien Fuchs of CNRS and the Laboratory for the Use of Intense Lasers, in Palaiseau, France. It’s too bad, he muses: “I think they would like that.”</p>



<p>Still, the measurements alone didn’t pinpoint if shock surfing was responsible for the protons’ speedup. “The challenge is always in the interpretation, so what exactly caused that acceleration,” says plasma physicist Frederico Fiuza of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif.,&nbsp;who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>So Fuchs and colleagues created computer simulations of the experiment. Comparing the simulations and the real data suggests that the protons were surfing the shock wave.</p>



<p>“This is definitely an exciting result,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz&nbsp;of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She says she hopes that further research would be able to uncover more direct evidence that doesn’t rely on computer simulations. “It’s very promising for future work.”</p>

<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unparalleled challenge not only to our health systems, but also to our lives as a community. During the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen a lot of misinformation and polarization around topics related to the virus and its spread. In a commendable effort to shed some light on this issue, Escandón from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia, and colleagues present a comprehensive, engaging and well documented review that deconstructs six common COVID-19 false dichotomies: 1) Health and lives vs. economy and livelihoods, 2) Indefinite lockdown vs. unlimited reopening, 3) Symptomatic vs. asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4) Droplet vs. aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 5) Masks for all vs. no masking, and 6) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection vs. no reinfection. As a take-home message, the authors highlight the critical need for meaningful public health communication and science-informed policies that recognize shades of gray, uncertainties, local context, and social determinants of health.</p>

<p>The last report from the United Nations assessing climate change estimates a global average increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. Urgent climate actions are needed and governments should prepare to secure food sources with the ability to thrive under high temperature environments. In their study, Gonzalo and colleagues from Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain focus on one of the most important horticultural crops worldwide, the tomato. The researchers exposed 219 tomato varieties to high temperature stress in controlled greenhouse experiments and measured reproductive traits such as flower and fruit number production to evaluate their heat tolerance. Although extreme high temperatures strongly decrease these traits in most varieties, 15 of them showed significant heat tolerance as well as good agronomic performance in open field cultivation under moderate temperature stress. The study also includes a transcriptomic analysis that offers a wide look into the genetic control of the heat tolerance mechanisms, making it a valuable source for future breeding programs.</p>

<p>Even before COVID-19 severely impaired our social connections, solitary home deaths from preventable causes have been on the rise in recent years, especially in the elderly population. In this article, Dr. Nakazawa and colleagues from University of Tokyo, Japan, present a balanced discussion about how wearable devices offer a promising platform for reducing solitary deaths in socially isolated individuals by swiftly connecting them to a broader range of health and social services.</p>
<p>The affordability, availability and functionality of these devices make them invaluable tools, but the authors point out that a successful social implementation will require closing the digital divide and tailoring devices to user preferences. In addition, the use of wearable devices must respect the autonomy and personhood of users and there is a need for proper governance of the information produced by the devices, such as policies to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which that data can be used.</p>

<p>As the second cause of death due to cancer worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is still in need of advanced prevention and treatment strategies. Here, Purushothaman and colleagues from University of California, San Diego, USA, assess the accumulative carcinogenic effect from vitamin D deficiency related to inadequate UVB exposure from sunlight.</p>
<p>By using UVB estimates data for 186 different countries obtained from NASA EOS Aura Spacecraft, authors modelled Vitamin D deficiency’s effects as a function of time where long-term chronic deficiencies correlate with increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Increasing age and environmental factors such as lower exposure to UVB radiation (e.g. living at higher latitudes) directly translated into a higher incidence of colorectal cancer. This association was more prominent in age groups over 45 years, even after taking into account factors such as life expectancy, smoking, skin pigmentation or stratospheric ozone.</p>
<p>The study highlights the need for adequate public health programs to avoid vitamin D inadequacy at national and global levels, especially in regions with lower UVB exposure.</p>

<p>The global incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases like Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease has been steadily increasing, prompting a great deal of research into treatment regimens.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by immune dysregulation and alterations in the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used increasingly to treat intestinal disorders such as UC but previous studies only use invasive endoscopic or enema-based approaches. In this prospective pilot study, Crothers from University of Vermont Medical Center, USA and colleagues set out to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of frozen, encapsulated oral FTM as treatment for UC. After 2 weeks of ambulatory oral FTM treatment, researchers observed sustained donor-induced shifts in fecal microbial composition. These changes persisted up to for 4 weeks longer than the intervals reported in previous studies using only colonoscopy FTM treatments. Longitudinal phenotyping analysis of peripheral T-cell populations also showed a correlation between decreased IL-17A and IFNγ mucosal-associated invariant T cell positivity and clinical scores improvement in patients after oral FTM.</p>
<p>Although this is a pilot study conducted on a small number of study subjects, it provides early evidence that warrants further studies on oral FTM treatments for UC.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/science-denial-why-it-happens-and-5-things-you-can-do-about-it/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-fauxels-3182752-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Science denial became deadly in 2020. Many political leaders <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-failure-of-public-health-messaging-about-covid-19/">failed to support what scientists knew to be effective</a> prevention measures. Over the course of the pandemic, people <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/16/south-dakota-nurse-coronavirus-deniers/">died from COVID-19 still believing it did not exist</a>.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Galileo/Mario-Livio/9781501194740">Science denial is not new</a>, of course. But it is more important than ever to understand why some people deny, doubt or resist scientific explanations—and what can be done to overcome these barriers to accepting science.</p><p>In our book “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/science-denial-9780190944681">Science Denial: Why It Happens and What to Do About It</a>,” we offer ways for you to understand and combat the problem. As <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzHZpAEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">two research</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VBvoFacAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">psychologists</a>, we know that everyone is susceptible to forms of it. Most importantly, we know there are solutions.</p><p>Here’s our advice on how to confront five psychological challenges that can lead to science denial.</p><h2>Challenge #1: social identity</h2><p>People are social beings and tend to align with those who hold <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119011071.iemp0153">similar beliefs and values</a>. Social media <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d43978-021-00019-4">amplify alliances</a>. You’re likely to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309214/the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser/">see more of what you already agree with</a> and fewer alternative points of view. People live in information filter bubbles created by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/02/08/code-dependent-pros-and-cons-of-the-algorithm-age/">powerful algorithms</a>. When those in your social circle share misinformation, you are more likely to believe it and share it. Misinformation multiplies and science denial grows.</p><p>Action #1: Each person has multiple social identities. One of us talked with a climate change denier and discovered he was also a grandparent. He opened up when thinking about his grandchildren’s future, and the conversation turned to economic concerns, the root of his denial. Or maybe someone is vaccine-hesitant because so are mothers in her child’s play group, but she is also a caring person, concerned about immunocompromised children.</p><p>We have found it effective to listen to others’ concerns and try to find common ground. Someone you <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-015-9312-x">connect with is more persuasive</a> than those with whom you share less in common. When one identity is blocking acceptance of the science, leverage a second identity to make a connection.</p><h2>Challenge #2: mental shortcuts</h2><p>Everyone’s busy, and it would be exhausting to be vigilant deep thinkers all the time. You see an article online with a clickbait headline such as “Eat Chocolate and Live Longer” and you share it, because you assume it is true, want it to be or think it is ridiculous.</p><p>Action #2: Instead of sharing that article on how GMOs are unhealthy, learn to slow down and monitor the quick, intuitive responses that psychologist <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557">Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 thinking</a>. Instead turn on the rational, analytical mind of System 2 and ask yourself, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2020.1730181">how do I know this is true</a>? Is it plausible? Why do I think it is true? Then do some fact-checking. Learn to not immediately accept information you already believe, which is called <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175">confirmation bias</a>.</p><h2>Challenge #3: beliefs on how and what you know</h2><p>Everyone has <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Epistemic-Cognition/Greene-Sandoval-Braten/p/book/9781138013421">ideas about what they think knowledge is</a>, where it comes from and whom to trust. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315795225-9/epistemic-cognition-psychological-construct-advancements-challenges-barbara-hofer">Some people think dualistically</a>: There’s always a clear right and wrong. But scientists view <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/0163853X.2019.1629805">tentativeness as a hallmark</a> of their discipline. Some people may not understand that scientific claims will change as more evidence is gathered, so they may be distrustful of how public health policy shifted around COVID-19.</p><p>Journalists who present “both sides” of settled scientific agreements can unknowingly persuade readers that the science is more uncertain than it actually is, turning <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001">balance into bias</a>. Only 57% of Americans surveyed accept that climate change is caused by human activity, compared with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/17/do-scientists-agree-on-climate-change/">97% of climate scientists</a>, and only <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/">55% think that scientists are certain that climate change is happening</a>.</p><p>Action #3: Recognize that other people (or possibly even you) may be operating with misguided beliefs about science. You can help them adopt what philosopher of science <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://leemcintyrebooks.com">Lee McIntyre</a> calls a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/scientific-attitude">scientific attitude</a>, an openness to seeking new evidence and a willingness to change one’s mind.</p><p>Recognize that very few individuals rely on a single authority for knowledge and expertise. Vaccine hesitancy, for example, has been successfully <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/time-doctors-take-center-stage-covid-19-vaccine-push">countered by doctors</a> who persuasively contradict erroneous beliefs, as well as by friends who explain why they <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://addisonindependent.com/joanna-colwell-i-didnt-vaccinate-my-child-and-then-i-did-0">changed their own minds</a>. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.churchleadership.com/leading-ideas/5-ways-churches-can-play-a-critical-role-in-vaccination-efforts/">Clergy can step forward</a>, for example, and some have offered places of worship as vaccination hubs.</p><h2>Challenge #4: motivated reasoning</h2><p>You might not think that how you interpret a simple graph could depend on your political views. But when people were asked to look at the same charts depicting either housing costs or the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over time, interpretations differed by political affiliation. Conservatives were more likely than progressives to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apadiv15.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/APA-2020-Hockey-Stick-1.pdf">misinterpret the graph</a> when it depicted a rise in CO2 than when it displayed housing costs. When people reason not just by examining facts, but with an unconscious bias to come to a preferred conclusion, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/what-is-motivated-reasoning-how-does-it-work-dan-kahan-answers">their reasoning will be flawed</a>.</p><p>Action #4: Maybe you think that eating food from genetically modified organisms is harmful to your health, but have you really examined the evidence? Look at articles with both pro and con information, evaluate the source of that information, and be open to the evidence leaning one way or the other. If you give yourself the time to think and reason, you can short-circuit your own motivated reasoning and open your mind to new information.</p><h2>Challenge #5: emotions and attitudes</h2><p>When Pluto got <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://theconversation.com/nasa-missions-may-re-elevate-pluto-and-ceres-from-dwarf-planets-to-full-on-planet-status-36081">demoted to a dwarf planet</a>, many children and some adults responded with anger and opposition. Emotions and attitudes are linked. Reactions to hearing that humans influence the climate can range from anger (if you do not believe it) to frustration (if you are concerned you may need to change your lifestyle) to anxiety and hopelessness (if you accept it is happening but think it’s too late to fix things).

<p>The research landscape constantly evolves as researchers build on prior findings, incorporate new methods, resources, and technologies, and respond to the needs of our global communities. PLOS keeps a watchful and enthusiastic eye on emerging research, and we update our policies as needed to address new challenges and opportunities that surface. In doing so, we work to advance our core mission and values aimed at transforming research communication and promoting Open Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, I summarize a few key updates we made between 2016-2021. For a more in-depth discussion of each, see the links in the &ldquo;Further reading&rdquo; section.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><br><strong>Open Science initiatives</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Partnering with bioRxiv for early access. </strong>Timely and widespread access to research output helps to inform ongoing investigations and ensure that resources and findings are used to their utmost potential. As has been exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid dissemination of research can directly impact clinical care and may in some cases have life-or-death consequences. All published PLOS articles are freely available under a CC BY license, but there is an inherent delay between research completion and peer-reviewed publication. To address this, PLOS partnered with <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> in May 2018 to give authors the option of posting submitted manuscripts as preprints. For authors who opt in, PLOS transfers manuscripts to bioRxiv after initial submission checks are complete.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Publishing peer review history. </strong>While Open Science ideals call for transparency, the industry standard has historically been to maintain the confidentiality of peer review. This provides important protections for the objectivity of the review process, enabling reviewers to contribute critical feedback without risk of personal retribution. However, it also withholds from readers information about the depth, quality, and content of the review process, and impedes research on peer review itself. PLOS has always published handling editors&rsquo; names on our articles, and we give reviewers the option to disclose their identities to authors. In May 2019, PLOS took a leap toward opening up peer review by giving authors the option to have peer review history (reviews, decision letters) published with accepted articles. Reviewers can still elect to keep their identity confidential.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Encouraging complementary research. </strong>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for multiple research groups to study the same or highly similar topics. Per traditional publishing standards, only the first report is accepted for publication and subsequent manuscripts tend to be rejected based on redundancy or lack of novelty. Viewing the same issue from another perspective, replication by independent research groups provides evidence as to the reproducibility and robustness of results. Recognizing the value of this for the scientific community, <em>PLOS Biology</em> innovated a Complementary Research policy in 2018. Under this policy, submissions are considered for publication even if a redundant or closely related study has been published or posted as a preprint within six months of the PLOS submission. This policy was expanded to all PLOS journals in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Publication ethics</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Formation of the Publication Ethics team.</strong> In January, 2018, <em>PLOS ONE</em> formed an editorial team dedicated to publication ethics. This team, whose scope expanded in 2020 to support all PLOS journals, addresses concerns raised about PLOS content, and contributes to internal policy discussions as well as external initiatives pertaining to ethics and integrity. Through this work, the team continually gains insights as to issues that commonly arise in submitted or published work and where policy or workflow updates may help. As a few examples, in 2020-21 we updated our Content and Licensing policy to clarify issues pertaining to confidential and proprietary content; elaborated our policy on Corrections, Expressions of Concern, and Retractions; and added submission guidelines about citation of retracted or corrected work.</p>



<p><strong>Blot and gel data policy.</strong> Image integrity concerns &ndash; whether due to honest errors or misconduct &ndash; present a substantial burden to the scientific and publishing communities and are often identified only after publication. Original uncropped and unadjusted image data can be instrumental in clarifying these issues, but as time passes it becomes increasingly difficult for researchers to retrieve image data from old computers and laboratory records. Toward improving the integrity and transparency of image data reporting, <em>PLOS ONE</em> and <em>PLOS Biology </em>implemented a policy in July 2019 whereby authors must provide original image data to support all reported blot and gel results. The raw images are available to editors before publication, and remain accessible indefinitely after publication in supporting information or data repositories. This provides additional assurance as to the results as well as protection for authors should post-publication questions arise. Importantly, this policy also presents a barrier against publication of fabricated results for which raw image data do not exist.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Responding to attribution needs of diverse contributors</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Identifying authors via ORCIDs. </strong>Publications are an important currency by which a researcher&rsquo;s work is measured and evaluated. However, issues around author names can hinder the discoverability and recognition of one&rsquo;s contributions. Open Researcher and Contributor IDs, or <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCIDs</a>, disambiguate research records for individuals who have the same or similar names and serve as stable identifiers through which researchers can record and promote their contributions to the public record over the course of their careers, even after name changes. Since 2013, we have given authors the option of listing ORCIDs on PLOS publications. In 2016 we began to require ORCIDs for corresponding authors, and we also started including ORCIDs with manuscript data we submit to CrossRef, which enables authors&rsquo; ORCID profiles to be automatically updated with their newly published PLOS articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Updated name change policy. </strong>For some researchers, the use of ORCIDs may not suffice to address attribution needs after mid-career name changes. For example, for transgender and non-binary gender individuals, publications under a deadname may not be identified as their own following a name change, and identifying with such publications via an ORCID or resume may reveal an aspect of one&rsquo;s personal history that the author prefers to keep private. There are also circumstances wherein an individual may find themselves at risk due to their involvement in controversial research or work that is not accepted within their community. PLOS is committed to providing an inclusive publishing environment for all researchers. To this end, in October 2020 PLOS was among the first publishers to update our Authorship policy to allow silent author name changes under certain circumstances, including for transgender and non-binary authors and authors who may be at risk. In such cases, we republish the article with the updated author list, and to honor authors&rsquo; privacy we do not notify co-authors or publish notices of republication.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Closing remarks</strong></h4>



<p>PLOS strives to address the changing needs of our communities, and we continually seek opportunities to improve research communications, including via updates to our policies and practices. We sincerely thank our contributors and partners for ongoing input and support.<br></p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Overcoming psychological barriers to vaccination remains a significant hurdle for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Any given COVID-19 news feature will remind you that vaccine hesitancy is rife, especially in countries such as the United States. Compounding the issue further, even those who fully intend to get their jab can be forgetful or procrastinate, further hampering efforts to get shots in arms.</p>



<p>As such, it’s vital to develop an effective toolbox to make it as effortless and appealing as possible for patients to book and turn up for their appointments. And though they may seem insignificant, one of the most useful behavioural nudges we have at our disposal is the mighty reminder message.</p>



<p>Crafting the wording of a reminder that packs a punch is no easy feat. As with most things in psychology, individual differences can greatly affect the response to any given nudge. But, thanks to research from Hengchen Dai at UCLA and team, we now have a better impression of how text-message reminders can impact vaccine uptake, as well as how to word them.</p>



<span id="more-43345"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03843-2">Their study</a>, published in Nature, describes two sequential randomised control trials on the topic. In the first study, the investigators recruited a massive 93,354 participants who had received an initial notification that they were eligible for their vaccine. The team randomly allocated participants in a 4:1 ratio to either a group that was sent a booking reminder text-message one day later, or a control group that received no reminder message.</p>



<p>Within the group that received the message, the authors looked at how different types of information provision and language affected uptake. All messages included two main points: a reminder of vaccine availability, and a link to an appointment scheduling website which allowed participants to book their slot right away. A subset of these also included language intended to induce a feeling of ownership over vaccines — specifically, the phrase “claim your dose”. This isn’t the first time this approach has been used; similar phrasing has been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101165118">shown to increase uptake</a> of flu vaccines.</p>



<p>To combat hesitancy and misunderstandings, a two-minute video aiming to dispel common vaccine misconceptions was also provided alongside a subsection of reminder messages, both with and without ownership induction phrases. Unfortunately, the authors note that only 21% of participants actually chose to watch it.</p>



<p>The team were interested in whether or not participants booked their vaccination appointment within six days following the first reminder, and whether they actually turned up and got their first dose within four weeks of the reminder. And they found that the messages worked: only 7.2% of those who didn’t receive a reminder booked within those six days, but this increased by 6.07 percentage points among those who received a reminder. Similarly, 13.89% of the non-reminder group had received their vaccine within four weeks, but this increased by 3.57 percentage points among those who received the text message.</p>



<p>Better yet, the reminders containing language inducing feelings of ownership over the vaccines appeared to be most effective, boosting appointment and vaccination rates by 6.83 and 4.13 percentage points, respectively, relative to those that received no reminder. This provides a strong endorsement for this type of phrasing in vaccination reminders.</p>



<p>Though these results are very promising, the study found no evidence to suggest that provision of information addressing vaccine hesitancy alongside these reminders was more effective at increasing uptake. However, given the small number of participants who actually watched the videos, this topic merits further investigation.</p>



<p>The second RCT (N=67,092) looked at additional reminder messages, sent eight days after initial vaccine eligibility to those who had not yet booked their first dose and may have been procrastinating or hesitant. The second, further reminder increased booking and vaccination rates by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively, compared to those who didn’t get a second message.</p>



<p>Further studies will be needed to fully understand whether this approach holds across other cultures outside of California. Establishing a feeling of ownership over vaccination decisions may be more or less motivating in different countries, and even in different areas within the United States, which could significantly affect the potency of this approach. Within this study, at least, analyses suggest that these increases in uptake were not largely affected by race or age, which may be promising for wider application.</p>



<p>Overall, these findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions. Not only are reminders clearly valuable tools in our arsenal, but wording that is crafted to induce feelings of ownership over vaccines appears to be particularly effective in increasing uptake. Adopting this as a standard approach for COVID-19 vaccine messaging in the USA, the authors estimate, could result in an additional 4.73 to 7.42 million people taking up the vaccine within a month of the reminder. In a moment where even small increases in vaccine uptake can have a tangible impact on the health of the population, research such as this serves to underline the impact that psychology can have when practically applied.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-stolen-fossil-big-head-walking-flying">This big-headed pterosaur may have preferred walking over flying</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2013, a police raid at Santos Harbor in Brazil recovered about 30,000 smuggled fossils, including the most intact specimen of a type of big-headed pterosaur ever found. A new analysis of the fossil provides <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254789">insight into the flying reptile’s foraging style, flight capability and anatomy</a>, researchers report August 25 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>Identified as <em>Tupandactylus navigans</em>, the fossil is a member of a group of pterosaurs called tapejarids. These pterosaurs are known for their oversize, crested skulls, and hail from the early Cretaceous Period, which lasted from about 145 million to 100 million years ago.</p>



<p>Some well-preserved tapejarid fossils have been found in China, but they aren’t as complete as the newly analyzed fossil, and the pterosaur’s anatomy hadn’t been fully described. “This is the first time we have the full skull and the full [body],” says Victor Beccari, a paleontologist at the NOVA School of Science &amp; Technology in Caparica, Portugal.</p>



<p>When Beccari’s team received the fossil in 2016, it had already been cut into six blocks. “It’s a shame,” Beccari says, “but we used it to our advantage.” The researchers fit the sliced pieces inside a CT scanner, and then used the scans to produce a 3-D model of the pterosaur’s skeleton that revealed parts still buried inside rock.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggested that tapejarids had a short, stout neck to support their large head during flight. But Beccari’s team showed that the neck accounted for over half of the spine’s length, which could have made sustained flight difficult. The fossil’s long hind legs and relatively short arms hint that tapejarids could have been comfortable walking.</p>



<p>These observations suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> may have behaved similarly to peacocks, Beccari says. The tapejarid’s crest probably attracted mates, and the pterosaur may have flown to treetops to look for food or escape from predators, he says. “But it spent most of its time walking on the ground.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-skeleton-woman-indonesia-peopling-southeast-asian-islands">Ancient DNA shows the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was surprisingly complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A young woman who lived on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi as early as around 7,300 years ago had a surprisingly ancient East Asian pedigree, mixed with a dash of Denisovan ancestry, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Researchers excavated the woman’s partial skeleton from South Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03823-6">analysis of her DNA</a> shows that she was a descendent of mainly East Asian <em>Homo sapiens</em> who probably reached the tropical outpost at least 50,000 years ago, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, many scientists thought that skilled mariners and farmers called Austronesians first spread East Asian genes through Wallacea, a group of islands between mainland Asia and Australia that includes Sulawesi, Lombok and Flores, around 3,500 years ago.</p>



<p>The ancient Sulawesi woman’s DNA “provides the first indication that an Asian ancestry was present in Wallacea long before the Austronesian expansion,” says archaeologist Adam Brumm of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.</p>



<p>Indonesian archaeologists who unearthed the skeleton — and who coauthored the new study with Brumm, population geneticist Selina Carlhoff of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and other colleagues — nicknamed the young woman, who was 17 or 18 years old when she died, Besse (pronounced BESS-eh). In ethnic communities of South Sulawesi, Besse is an affectionate term for individual girls and women.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="737" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg" alt="researchers working at Leang Panninge cave" class="wp-image-3102934" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-535x383.jpg 535w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-629x450.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-260x186.jpg 260w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-768x550.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082321_BB_wallacea-woman_inline-811x580.jpg 811w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102934">Researchers work at the entrance to Sulawesi’s Leang Panninge cave. Ancient DNA was extracted from a hunter-gatherer’s skeleton excavated inside the cave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102934">Leang Panninge research team</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After arriving on Sulawesi, the woman’s ancestors mated with Denisovans who already inhabited the island, the investigators suspect. Known mainly from ancient DNA samples, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fossil-denisovan-skull-cave-siberia">Denisovans</a> are a group of mysterious ancient hominids who date to as early as around 300,000 years ago in Siberia and survived on nearby Papua New Guinea until as late as 30,000 to 15,000 years ago (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>The discovery of Besse shows that the peopling of Southeast Asian islands was much more complex than has typically been appreciated, says population geneticist Lluis Quintana-Murci of Collége de France and the Pasteur Institute, both in Paris. “Wallacea was probably a key habitat region for Denisovan-related groups,” adds Quintana-Murci, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>The researchers estimate that the ancient Sulawesi woman inherited about 2.2 percent of her DNA from Denisovans. That’s a bit less than some other groups in the region. Indigenous groups in the Philippines carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">the highest known levels of Denisovan ancestry, topping out at about 5 percent</a> (<em>SN: 8/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Earlier genetic evidence suggested that different Denisovan populations interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> groups in the Philippines and on a land mass that included what’s now Papua New Guinea and Australia. The Sulawesi woman’s DNA indicates that interbreeding occurred in Wallacea as some Stone Age <em>H. sapiens</em> made their way toward Papua New Guinea and Australia. “The major gene flow from Denisovans into ancestors of Papuans and Aboriginal Australians most likely took place once [<em>H. sapiens</em>] reached the Wallacea islands,” says population geneticist and study coauthor Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>





<p>The woman’s DNA more closely resembles that of present-day Papuans and Indigenous Australians than of any current mainland East Asians, the scientists say. Those comparisons indicate that she belonged to a previously unknown, distinct genetic line of humans that emerged around 37,000 years ago, roughly the same time as a previously estimated evolutionary split of Papuans from Indigenous Australians. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Carefully crafted stone points that had been placed in the ancient woman’s grave identify her as a member of South Sulawesi’s Toalean hunter-gatherer people, Brumm says. Toalean stone artifacts date to between roughly 8,000 and 1,500 years ago. Evidence of Toalean culture disappears after that.</p>



<p>The Indonesian coauthors of the new study excavated the ancient woman’s partial skeleton from 2015 to 2019. Surviving fossils mainly came from the skull and pelvis. DNA was extracted from a dense bone in the base of the skull that’s known to preserve genetic material especially well. Fossils in tropical climates like Indonesia’s rarely yield ancient DNA because the fragile genetic material doesn’t typically survive those conditions.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of a burned seed from a common Southeast Asian tree, which was found near the skeleton, provided an age estimate of between around 7,300 and 7,200 years.</p>



<p>It’s not known if ancestors of Besse created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-cave-painting-art-pig-found-indonesia">previously discovered Sulawesi rock art of a pig that dates to at least 45,500 years ago</a>, one of the oldest known artistic depictions of a real-world organism (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). So the artists of that work remain a mystery, for now.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Imposter syndrome — the feeling that you don&#8217;t belong or aren&#8217;t capable at work or in education — can affect anybody. But people from underrepresented backgrounds are more likely to experience imposter syndrome: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">first generation university students</a>, for example, or <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-09930-002">people of colour</a>.</p>



<p>Imposter syndrome can be particularly acute in academia, where intellectual flair is prized. In fact, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-70498-001">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Educational Psychology</em> finds that in fields in which intellectual “brilliance” is perceived to be a prerequisite to success, imposter syndrome is more likely to strike women and early-career academics.</p>



<span id="more-43350"></span>



<p>Participants were 4,870 academics from nine universities in the United States, all of which had a medical school, were research intensive, and were ranked in the country’s top 100 institutions. After noting down their field of research, participants completed a measure of imposter feelings, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am afraid people important to me may find out that I am not as capable as they think I am”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, they filled in measures of belonging (how accepted they felt by others in their field) and self-efficacy (how confident they were in their ability to succeed). Finally, participants indicated to what extent they felt brilliance was required for success in their field, again indicating agreement or disagreement with statements such as “being a top scholar of [my discipline] requires a special aptitude that just can’t be taught” and “I think that with the right amount of effort and dedication, anyone can be a top scholar of [my discipline]”.</p>



<p>Overall, women reported more imposter feelings than men. And women reported greater feelings of being an imposter the more that they believed their field was oriented towards natural brilliance rather than hard work. Those early on in their careers also reported more imposter feelings than those on faculty or in more secure positions, and again reported greater imposter feelings the more that they felt their field required natural brillance. People who reported more imposter feelings were also likely to rate themselves as lower in self-efficacy and lower in feelings of belonging to their wider field.</p>



<p>The gender differences were even starker when the team looked at the ethnic background of academics, too: compared to White or Asian women, women from underrepresented minority backgrounds experienced even greater levels of imposter syndrome in fields perceived as emphasising brilliance. So although the results were only correlational, the more a field was perceived to have an emphasis on or need for raw brilliance or genius, the more certain groups — women, people from ethnic groups underrepresented in academia, and early-career academics — were likely to experience imposter feelings and a lack of belonging.</p>



<p>Beyond the potential distress or stress that imposter feelings can cause, there could also be other ramifications. Low levels of self-efficacy and belonging are likely to impact not only productivity but likelihood of continuing in the field. Indeed, the team notes that the lower level of&nbsp; imposter feelings among established academics could be down to a survivorship bias: those who never feel like they don’t belong are more likely to pursue a further career in academia than those who feel a lack of community or lack of ability. A longitudinal study could explore this further. If those who feel a lack of belonging are also more likely to belong to underrepresented groups, this could also hinder efforts to make particular fields more diverse.</p>



<p>It could also be that we need to reframe how we think about imposter syndrome altogether. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2021.1924137">Other research</a>, for example, has suggested that &#8220;imposterism&#8221; is a bad lens through which to view the struggles Black doctoral students face in racist environments. Rather than framing imposter feelings as an internal phenomenon, it may be more helpful to think about those barriers that stand in the way of certain people feeling comfortable and successful in their fields – and to try to break those barriers down.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-70498-001">Women—particularly underrepresented minority women—and early-career academics feel like impostors in fields that value brilliance.</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">Racism lurks in names given to plants and animals. That’s starting to change</a></h4>

              
                <p>With lemon and black plumage, the Scott’s oriole flashes in the desert like a flame. But the bird’s name holds a violent history that Stephen Hampton can’t forget. He used to see the orioles often, living in California. Now that he lives outside the bird’s range, “I’m kind of relieved,” he says.</p>



<p>Hampton is a birder and registered citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Winfield Scott, a U.S. military commander and the bird’s namesake, drove Hampton’s ancestors and other Native Americans from their land in the 1800s during a series of forced marches now known as the Trail of Tears. The journey killed over 4,000 Cherokee, displacing <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/482714?refreqid=excelsior%3Af88ed89a5d19437b33a44e3a3f1c42c0">as many as 100,000</a> people in the end.</p>



<p>“So much of the Trail of Tears is already erased,” Hampton says. “There’s a few historical sites, but you’d have to be an archaeologist to figure out where the actual stockades were.” Linking Scott’s legacy to a bird “is just adding to the erasure by putting another layer over it.” </p>



<p>The oriole is just one of dozens of species that scientists are considering renaming because of racist or other offensive connotations. In a groundswell of revision, scientists are wrestling with this heritage. </p>





<p>Racist relics can infuse both scientific and common names. But in contrast to scientific names — which are internationally standardized in Latin — common names live in the vernacular. They vary by language and region, and have a smaller scope than scientific names’ international reach, making them arguably simpler to change. Some get immortalized in field guides and formally recognized by scientific societies. These common names provide a useful shared language for scientists and the public, but they can also enshrine harmful legacies. Advocates for change see some names as barriers to inclusion and distractions from the organisms themselves. But those advocates also see opportunities in renaming.</p>



<p>“We can choose language that reflects our shared values,” says Jessica Ware, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and president-elect of the Entomological Society of America, or ESA. Name changes themselves are nothing new; scientific and common names both shift as scientists learn more about a species. The ESA keeps a list of English common names for insects, updated annually.</p>



<p>In July, the ESA removed the pejorative term “gypsy,” what many consider to be a slur for Romani people, from its common name list for two insects, the moth <em>Lymantria dispar</em> and the ant <em>Aphaenogaster araneoides</em>. The ESA has invited new name suggestions from the public. In the meantime, the insects will go by their internationally recognized scientific names.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a moral, necessary and long-overdue change,” says Margareta Matache, a Roma rights activist and scholar at Harvard University. It’s a “small yet historic” step to rectify portrayals where “Roma have been denied humanity or depicted as less than human,” she says.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">Better Common Names Project</a>, the ESA now prohibits names perpetuating negative stereotypes, and welcomes public input about which names to change next. So far, over 80 insensitive names have been identified, and over 100 name ideas for <em>L. dispar</em> have streamed in, Ware says. With a “bottom-up swelling of names” to choose from, “everybody is included,” she says.</p>



<p>But racist legacies lurk in lingo.<strong> </strong>Some scorpions, birds, fishes and flowers are known by the label Hottentot, a term of abuse for Indigenous Khoikhoi people in southern Africa. The Digger pine tree bears a pejorative for the Paiute people in the western United States, once derisively called diggers by white settlers.</p>

<h3>Changing offensive common names of species is nothing new</h3>



<p>It’s not unusual for common names, or even Latin names, of species to change. Sometimes new information about a species prompts a name change, but as the following examples show, names deemed offensive have been revised for at least two decades.</p>



<p><strong>Pikeminnow</strong> (<em>Ptychocheilus</em>): Four pikeminnow fish species were once called “squawfish,” using an offensive term for Native American women. In 1998, the American Fisheries Society changed the name, as an “exceptional” example of a violation of “good taste.”</p>



<p><strong>Long-tailed duck</strong> (<em>Clangula hyemalis</em>): In 2000, the American Ornithological Society renamed the derogatory “Oldsquaw” duck after urging from Indigenous communities — but not officially because the name was offensive. “Long-tailed duck” was already used in Europe, so the reasoning of maintaining consistency was accepted.</p>



<p><strong>Goliath grouper</strong> (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>): This 800-pound fish was formerly known as the “jewfish.” The American Fisheries Society changed the name in 2001, after a petition citing the name’s offensiveness.</p>
</div>



<p>The bird world, in particular, has been reckoning with such legacies. Birds named for people proliferated in 19th century ornithology, glorifying the namers themselves or figures they favored. Today, 142 North American bird names endure as verbal monuments to people. Some names — such as Scott’s oriole, chosen by naturalist and U.S. military officer Darius Nash Couch — lionize people who participated in genocide. Others — such as Bachman’s sparrow, named after Lutheran minister and naturalist John Bachman — venerate people who defended slavery. “Blacks and Native Americans would have always been opposed to these names,” Hampton says.</p>



<p>Since 2020, supporters of the grassroots campaign <a href="https://birdnamesforbirds.wordpress.com/">Bird Names for Birds</a> have advocated for a solution — replace all eponymous bird names with descriptive ones. “It&#8217;s not a be-all-end-all solution” to removing barriers to birding for minority communities, says Robert Driver, an evolutionary biologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C. But it’s one gesture of “consideration for everyone who&#8217;s out there with binoculars.”</p>



<p>The American Ornithological Society initially rejected Driver’s proposal to revise the name of a brownish-gray bird called McCown’s longspur, named after Confederate general John P. McCown. But after the 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide reflection on systemic racism and as some Confederate monuments were removed and sports teams with offensive epithets were renamed, the ornithology society changed its policies to consider a namesake’s role in “reprehensible events” as grounds for revision. Now, the bird is known as the thick-billed longspur. <strong></strong></p>



<p>Driver wants Scott’s oriole to be next — but for now, English bird name changes have paused while a committee with the society <a href="https://americanornithology.org/english-bird-names/whats-next-for-english-bird-names/">recommends a new name-changing process</a>. “We are committed to changing these harmful and exclusionary names,” says Mike Webster, an ornithologist at Cornell University and president of the society.</p>



<p>Removing harmful terms offers long-term stability in common names, Ware says. With thoughtful criteria, scientists and others can craft names built to last. “So it might be uncomfortable now,” Ware says. “But hopefully, that only happens once.”</p>



<p>As for Hampton, he doesn’t see Scott’s oriole anymore, now that he lives in Washington State. But he still can’t escape these types of names. Sometimes while birding, he spies Townsend’s solitaire — a bird that favors juniper berries. It’s named after American naturalist John Kirk Townsend, who collected Indigenous people’s skulls in the 1830s for cranial measurements that were used to justify pseudoscientific racial hierarchies. “Every time I see one [of the birds], I&#8217;m thinking, ‘That should be juniper solitaire,’” Hampton says. In his mind’s eye, Scott’s oriole is the yucca oriole. “I can&#8217;t wait for those to be changed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-toad-pupil-eye-seven-different-shapes">Frog and toad pupils mainly come in seven different shapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frog and toad pupils come in quite the array, from slits to circles. But overall, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1402">there are seven main shapes of these animals’ peepholes</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 25 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Eyes are “among the most charismatic features of frogs and toads,” says herpetologist Julián Faivovich of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales “Bernardino Rivadavia” in Buenos Aires. People have long marveled at the animals’ many iris colors and pupil shapes. Yet “there’s almost nothing known about the anatomical basis of that diversity.”</p>



<p>Faivovich and colleagues catalogued pupil shapes from photos of 3,261 species, representing 44 percent of known frogs and toads. The team identified seven main shapes: vertical slits, horizontal slits, diamonds, circles, triangles, fans and inverted fans. The most common shape, horizontal slits, appeared in 78 percent of studied species.</p>



<p>Mapping pupil shapes onto a tree of evolutionary relationships allowed the scientists to infer how these seven shapes emerged. Though uncommon in other vertebrates, horizontal pupils seem to have given rise to most of the other shapes in frogs and toads. All together, these seven shapes have evolved at least 116 times, the researchers say.</p>

Cervino <em>et al</em>/<em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pupil shape affects the amount of light that reaches the retina and its light-receiving cells, says Nadia Cervino, a herpetologist also at the Argentine museum. But how the shape influences what animals actually see isn’t well-known.</p>



<p>Pupil shapes generally didn’t correspond with animals’ lifestyles and habitats. The scientists plan to continue investigating what drives pupil evolution in tree frogs, a smaller group with fewer types of pupil shapes. And the team will consider other lifestyle factors, including how high frogs climb or whether they lay eggs in water, as well as other eye characteristics, such as iris color, to see if those factors matter to pupil shape.</p>



<p>With a biodiversity crisis caused by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll">a skin fungus</a> that has led to many presumed extinctions of frogs and toads worldwide, researchers may be losing clues to this mystery (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/28/19</em>). “When we are losing species,” Faivovich says, “we’re actually losing the opportunity of learning a lot about them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/24/ability-to-name-unrelated-words-is-a-good-test-of-creativity/">Ability To Name Unrelated Words Is A Good Test Of Creativity</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Obtaining a solid measurement of creativity can be hugely time consuming. Well-established tests — such as the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), which asks participants to generate unusual ways to use common objects — require substantial time and effort in order to properly score participant responses. Not only that, but assessment of the creativity of responses varies wildly as a result of both the scorers’ judgements and the qualities of answers relative to the rest of the data. For example, one especially creative response amongst a sea of generic responses may garner extra points; place that same answer amongst other highly creative responses, however, and it is likely to score lower.</p>



<p>But take heart, overstretched researchers — a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/25/e2022340118">new paper</a> in <em>PNAS</em> suggests there may be an easier, more reliable way to measure creativity.</p>



<p>In an effort to combat these issues, researchers led by Jay A. Olson from Harvard University have attempted to streamline the process by devising a new task which can be easily analysed by a computer algorithm.</p>



<p>Their research suggests that the newly created measure — the Divergent Association Task (DAT) — may be at least as effective at measuring verbal creativity as other, more widely known creativity measures, with the added bonuses of being both shorter and more enjoyable to participants.</p>



<span id="more-43340"></span>



<p>The DAT relies on the concept of <em>semantic distance</em>, which is a measure of how related two words are to each other. Traditional approaches to measuring creativity require participants to give long, prose-like answers, and algorithms struggle to analyse semantic distance in these tasks. This is because the exact meaning of words often hinges on nuance, sentence structure, and context. For instance, the authors write, in the Alternative Uses Task someone might say that they use a pen to “record a break” or to “break a record”. The latter is clearly more creative, but a programme looking at semantic distance wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.</p>



<p>However, by using single words as opposed to prose, the DAT effectively circumnavigates these issues by breaking responses down into components that can be easily analysed by a computer. During the task, participants are asked to produce 10 nouns as unrelated to each other as possible over the span of four minutes, generating a small pool of words for analysis. The semantic distance between the first seven valid words provided is then computed using an algorithm called GIoVe, which has been trained on text from billions of web pages.</p>



<p>The team conducted two studies comparing the DAT to established measures of creativity. The first study, conducted on a total of 476 predominantly female undergraduate students from Australia and Canada, demonstrated that the new measure correlated well with two components of the AUT’s creativity measure — flexibility and originality — though not the third component, fluency. There was also a strong positive correlation between DAT scores and scores on the Bridge-The-Associative-Gap task, in which participants are presented with two words (eg. giraffe, scarf) and are asked to provide the word that links them (eg. neck).</p>



<p>In the pre-registered second study, a more generalisable selection of 8,572 participants from 98 countries performed a shortened version of the AUT and the DAT. While the shortened AUT meant fluency and flexibility couldn’t be measured, the AUT and DAT scores did correlate positively on the dimension of originality. Participants also completed four problems probing insight, creativity, and analytical ability; higher scores in these tasks also positively correlated with DAT scores.</p>



<p>Not only does this new approach cut out much of the human effort and variability involved in judging scores, it also provides distinct advantages in certain research contexts. In the case of fMRI studies, for example, providing a handful of one-word answers is preferable to whole sentences, as it reduces the amount of participant movement. Researchers interested in simple creativity tasks for participants to complete under the influence of drugs such as psychedelics may also find the method particularly appealing.</p>



<p>As with most measurements, this new test does have some limitations. The authors highlight that several strategies can be employed to boost scores. For instance, participants might use items in the room to help them come up with new ideas, or intentionally reach for rarely used words which the algorithm may read as more semantically remote. It’s possible that this could lead the algorithm to inadvertently rating participants with higher education levels or more diverse vocabularies as more “creative”. It’s also unclear what influence multilingualism may have on DAT scores, though all of these factors are the subject of ongoing investigations by the team. In future, the analysis algorithm could be trained to process responses from more languages, time periods, and cultures to further improve the method’s precision.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541673595">Flashes of Creation</a><br><em>Paul Halpern</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>The Big Bang wasn’t always a sure bet. For several decades in the 20th century, researchers wrestled with interpreting cosmic origins, or if there even was a beginning at all. At the forefront of that debate stood physicists George Gamow and Fred Hoyle: One advocated for an expanding universe that sprouted from a hot, dense state; the other for a cosmos that is eternal and unchanging. Both pioneered contemporary cosmology, laid the groundwork for our understanding of where atoms come from and brought science to the masses.</p>



<p>In <em>Flashes of Creation</em>, physicist Paul Halpern recounts Gamow’s and Hoyle’s interwoven stories. The book bills itself as a “joint biography,” but that is a disservice. While Gamow and Hoyle are the central characters, the book is a meticulously researched history of the Big Bang as an idea: from theoretical predictions in the 1920s, to the discovery of its microwave afterglow in 1964, and beyond to the realization in the late 1990s that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.</p>





<p>Although the development of cosmology was the work of far more than just two scientists, Halpern would be hard-pressed to pick two better mascots. George Gamow was an aficionado of puns and pranks and had a keen sense of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/george-gamow-physicist-science-popularizer">how to explain science with charm and whimsy</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/18</em>). The fiercely stubborn Fred Hoyle had a darker, more cynical wit, with an artistic side that showed through in science fiction novels and even the libretto of an opera. Both wrote popular science books — Gamow’s <em>Mr Tompkins</em> series, which explores modern physics through the titular character’s dreams, are a milestone of the genre — and took to the airwaves to broadcast the latest scientific thinking into people’s homes.</p>





<p>“Gamow and Hoyle were adventurous loners who cared far more about cosmic mysteries than social conventions,” Halpern writes. “Each, in his own way, was a polymath, a rebel, and a master of science communication.”</p>



<p>While the Big Bang is now entrenched in the modern zeitgeist, it wasn’t always so. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">idea can be traced to Georges Lemaître</a>, a physicist and priest who proposed in 1927 that the universe is expanding. A few years later, he suggested that perhaps the cosmos began with all of its matter in a single point — the “primeval atom,” he called it. In the 1940s, Gamow latched on to the idea as way to explain how all the atomic elements came to be, forged in the “fireball” that would have filled the cosmos in its earliest moments. Hoyle balked at the notion of a moment of creation, convinced that the universe has always existed — and always will exist — in pretty much the same state we find it today. He even coined the term “Big Bang” as a put-down during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast. The elements, Hoyle argued, were forged in stars.</p>



<p>As far as the elements go, both were right. “One wrote the beginning of the story of element creation,” Halpern writes, “and the other wrote the ending.” We now know that hydrogen and helium nuclei emerged in overwhelming abundance during the first few minutes following the Big Bang. Stars took care of the rest.</p>



<p>Halpern treats Gamow and Hoyle with reverence and compassion. Re-created scenes provide insight into how both approached science and life. We learn how Gamow, ever the scientist, roped in physicist Niels Bohr to test ideas about why movie heroes always drew their gun faster than villains — a test that involved staging a mock attack with toy pistols. We sit in with Hoyle and colleagues while they discuss a horror film, <em>Dead of Night</em>, whose circular timeline inspired their ideas about an eternal universe.</p>

<p>And Halpern doesn’t shy away from darker moments, inviting readers to know these scientists as flawed human beings. Gamow’s devil-may-care attitude wore on his colleagues, and his excessive drinking took its toll. Hoyle, in his waning decades, embraced outlandish ideas, suggesting that epidemics come from space and that a dinosaur fossil had been tampered with to show an evolutionary link to birds. And he went to his grave in 2001 still railing against the Big Bang.</p>



<p>Capturing the history of the Big Bang theory is no easy task, but Halpern pulls it off. The biggest mark against the book, in fact, may be its scope. To pull in all the other characters and side plots that drove 20th century cosmology, Gamow and Hoyle sometimes get forgotten about for long stretches. A bit more editing could have sharpened the book’s focus.</p>



<p>But to anyone interested in how the idea of the Big Bang grew — or how any scientific paradigm changes — <em>Flashes of Creation</em> is a treat and a worthy tribute to two scientific mavericks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">The definition of planet is still a sore point – especially among Pluto fans</a></h4>

              
                <p>For 76 years, Pluto was the beloved ninth planet. No one cared that it was the runt of the solar system, with a moon, Charon, half its size. No one minded that it had a tilted, eccentric orbit. Pluto was a weirdo, but it was our weirdo.</p>



<p>“Children identify with its smallness,” wrote science writer Dava Sobel in her 2005 book <em>The Planets</em>. “Adults relate to its inadequacy, its marginal existence as a misfit.”</p>



<p>When Pluto was excluded from the planetary display in 2000 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, children sent hate mail to Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the museum’s planetarium. Likewise, there was a popular uproar when 15 years ago, in August 2006, the International Astronomical Union, or IAU, wrote a new definition of “planet” that left Pluto out. The new definition required that a body 1) orbit the sun, 2) have enough mass to be spherical (or close) and 3) have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other bodies. Objects that meet the first two criteria but not the third, like Pluto, were designated “dwarf planets.”</p>



<p>Science is not sentimental. It doesn’t care what you’re fond of, or what mnemonic you learned in elementary school. Science appeared to have won the day. Scientists learned more about the solar system and revised their views accordingly.</p>





<p>“I believe that the decision taken was the correct one,” says astronomer Catherine Cesarsky of CEA Saclay in France, who was president of the IAU in 2006. “Pluto is very different from the eight solar system planets, and it would have been very difficult to keep changing the number of solar system planets as more massive [objects beyond Neptune] were being discovered. The intention was not at all to demote Pluto, but on the contrary to promote it as [a] prototype of a new class of solar system objects, of great importance and interest.”</p>





<p>For a long time, I shared this view. I’ve been writing about Pluto since my very first newspaper gig at the <em>Cornell Daily Sun</em>, when I was a junior in college in 2006. I interviewed some of my professors about the IAU’s decision. One, planetary scientist Jean-Luc Margot, who is now at UCLA, called it “a triumph of science over emotion. Science is all about recognizing that earlier ideas may have been wrong,” he said at the time. “Pluto is finally where it belongs.”</p>



<p>But another, planetary scientist Jim Bell, now at Arizona State University in Tempe, thought the decision was a travesty. He still does. The idea that planets have to clear their orbits is particularly irksome, he says. The ability to collect or cast out all that debris doesn’t just depend on the body itself.</p>



<p>Everything with interesting geology should be a planet, Bell told me recently. “I’m a lumper, not a splitter,” he says. “It doesn’t matter where you are, it matters what you are.”</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with him. “Fifteen years ago we finally got it right,” says planetary scientist Mike Brown of Caltech, who uses the Twitter handle @plutokiller because his research helped knock Pluto out of the planetary pantheon. “Pluto had been wrong all along.”</p>



<p>But since 2006, we’ve learned that Pluto has an atmosphere and maybe even clouds. It has mountains made of water ice, fields of frozen nitrogen, methane snow–capped peaks, and dunes and volcanoes. “It’s a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-pluto-unveiled-world-no-other">dynamic, complex world unlike any other orbiting the sun</a>,” journalist Christopher Crockett wrote in <em>Science News </em>in 2015 when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto.</p>

<p>The New Horizons mission showed that Pluto has fascinating and active geology to rival that of any rocky world in the inner solar system. And that solidified planetary scientist Philip Metzger’s view that the IAU definition missed the mark.</p>



<p>“There was an immediate reaction against the dumb definition” when it was proposed, says Metzger, of the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Since then, he and colleagues have been refining their views: “Why do we have this intuition that says that it’s dumb?”</p>



<h4>Retelling the tale</h4>



<p>It turns out that the “we just learned more” narrative isn’t really true, Metzger says. Though the official story is that Pluto was reclassified because new data came in, it’s not that simple. Teaching that narrative is bad for science, and for science education, he says.</p>



<p>The truth is, there’s no single definition of a planet — and I’m beginning to believe that’s a good thing.</p>



<p>For centuries, the word “planet” was a much more inclusive term. When Galileo turned his telescope at Jupiter, any largish moving body in the sky was considered a planet — including moons. When astronomers discovered the rocky bodies we now call asteroids in the 1800s, those too were called planets, at least at first.</p>



<p>Pluto was considered a planet from the very beginning. When Clyde Tombaugh, an amateur astronomer from Kansas newly recruited to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., spotted it in photos taken in January 1930, he rushed to the observatory director and declared: “I have found your Planet X.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh.jpg" alt="Clyde Tombaugh standing outside next to his telescope" class="wp-image-3102815" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-383x383.jpg 383w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-580x580.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_Clyde-Tombaugh-214x214.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102815">Clyde Tombaugh, shown here with a homemade telescope, discovered Pluto in 1930 when he was 24 years old.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102815">GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The discovery was no accident. In 1903, U.S. astronomer Percival Lowell hypothesized that a hidden planet seven times the mass of Earth orbited 45 times farther from the sun. Lowell had searched for what he called Planet X until he died in 1916. The search continued without him.</p>



<p>The new planet was thought to be “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/black-coal-dense-zinc">black as coal</a>, nearly as dense as iron, twice as dense as the heaviest earthly surface rocks,” <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, reported in 1930.</p>



<p>Further research showed Lowell had grossly overestimated Pluto’s mass: It’s more like one five-hundredth the mass of Earth. Things got even weirder when scientists realized <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/distant-object-hints-kuiper-belt">Pluto wasn’t alone out there</a>. In 1992, an object about a tenth the diameter of Pluto was found orbiting the sun “in the deep freeze of space well beyond the orbits of Pluto and Neptune,” as <em>Science News </em>described it.</p>



<p>Since then, more than 2,000 icy bodies have been found hiding in that frigid zone dubbed the Kuiper Belt, and there are many more out there. Awareness of Pluto’s neighbors brought new questions: What characteristics could unite these strange new worlds with the more familiar ones? And what sets them apart? With so many new objects coming into focus, there was a growing desire for a formal definition of “planet.”</p>



<p>In 2005, Brown spotted the first of the Kuiper Belt bodies that seemed to be larger than Pluto. If Pluto was the ninth planet, then surely the new discovery, nicknamed Xena (in honor of the TV show <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em>), should be the 10th. But if Xena was an icy leftover from the formation of the solar system undeserving of the “planet” title, so too was Pluto.</p>



<p>Tensions over how to categorize Pluto and Xena came to a head in 2006 at a meeting in Prague of the IAU. On the final day, August 24, after much acrimonious debate, a new definition of “planet” was put to a vote. Pluto and Xena got the boot. Xena was aptly renamed Eris, the Greek goddess of discord.</p>

<p>Textbooks were revised, posters were reprinted, but many planetary scientists, especially those who study Pluto, never bothered to change. “Planetary scientists don’t use the IAU’s definition in publishing papers,” Metzger says. “We pretty much just ignore it.”</p>



<p>In part that might be cheek, or spite. But Metzger and colleagues think there’s good reason to reject the definition. Metzger, Bell and others — including Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute, the planetary scientist who led the New Horizons mission and has argued since before the discovery of the Kuiper Belt that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/plutos-galore">the solar system contains hundreds of “planets”</a> — make their case in a pair of recent papers, one <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103518303063?via%3Dihub">published in 2019 in <em>Icarus</em></a> and one forthcoming.</p>



<p>After examining hundreds of scientific papers, textbooks and letters dating back centuries, the researchers show that the way scientists and the public have used the word “planet” has changed over time, but not in the way most people think.</p>



<h4>In and out</h4>



<p>Consider Ceres, the first of what are now known as dwarf planets to be discovered. Located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres was considered a planet after its 1801 discovery, too. It’s often said that Ceres was demoted after astronomers found the rest of the bodies in the asteroid belt. By the end of the 1800s, with hundreds of asteroids piling up, Ceres was stripped of its planetary title thanks to its neighbors. In that sense, the story goes, Ceres and Pluto suffered the same fate.</p>



<p>But that’s not the real story, Metzger and colleagues found. Ceres and other asteroids were considered planets, sometimes dubbed “minor planets,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/small-fry-solar-system">well into the 20th century</a>. A 1951 article in <em>Science News Letter </em>declared that “thousands of planets are known to circle our sun,” although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/small-fry-solar-system">most are “small fry.</a>” These “baby planets” can be as small as a city block or as wide as Pennsylvania.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inilne_ceres.jpg" alt="image of Ceres" class="wp-image-3102814" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inilne_ceres.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inilne_ceres-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inilne_ceres-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102814">The dwarf planet Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt.

<p>It wasn’t until the 1960s, when spacecraft offered better observations of these bodies, that the term “minor planets” fell out of fashion. While the largest asteroids still looked planetlike, most small asteroids turned out to be lumpy and irregular in shape, suggesting a different origin or different geophysics than bigger, rounder planets. The fact that asteroids didn’t “clear their orbits” had nothing to do with the name change, Metzger argues.</p>



<p>And what about moons? Scientists called them “planets” or “secondary planets” until the 1920s. Surprisingly, it was nonscientific publications, notably astrological almanacs that used the positions of celestial bodies for horoscope readings, that insisted on the simplicity of a limited number of planets moving through the fixed sphere of stars.</p>



<p>Metzger thinks that older definition of a planet that included moons was forgotten when planetary science went through a “Great Depression” between about 1910 and 1950. So many asteroids had been discovered that searching for new ones or refining their orbits was getting boring. Telescopes weren’t good enough to start exploring asteroids’ geology yet. Other parts of space science were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">way more exciting</a>, so attention went there.</p>



<p>But new data that came with space travel brought moons back into the planetary fold. Starting in the 1960s, “planet” reappeared in the scientific literature as a description for satellites, at least the large, round ones.</p>



<h4>Real-world usage</h4>



<p>The planet definition that includes certain moons, asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects has had staying power because it’s useful, Metzger says. Planetary scientists’ work includes comparing a place like Mars (a planet) to Titan (a moon) to Triton (a moon that was probably born in the Kuiper Belt and captured by Neptune long ago) to Pluto (a dwarf planet). It’s scientifically useful to have a word to describe the cosmic bodies where interesting geophysics, including the conditions that enable life, occur, he says. There’s all sorts of extra complexity, from mountains to atmospheres to oceans and rivers, when rocky worlds grow big enough for their own gravity to make them spherical.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="543" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit.jpg" alt="diagram showing the solar system and Pluto's orbit" class="wp-image-3102816" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit-680x358.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit-800x422.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit-330x174.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082821_pluto_inline_orbit-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102816">Pluto and hundreds or thousands of other objects that rival Pluto in size and interest orbit in the icy back of the solar system’s fridge, called the Kuiper Belt (white fuzzy ring).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102816">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“We’re not claiming that we have the perfect definition of a planet and that all scientists ought to adopt our definition,” he adds. That’s the same mistake the IAU made. “We’re saying this is something that ought to be debated.”</p>



<p>A more inclusive definition of “planet” would also give a more accurate concept of what the solar system is. Emphasizing the eight major planets suggests that they dominate the solar system, when in fact the smaller stuff outnumbers those worlds tremendously. The major planets don’t even stay put in their orbits over long time-scales. The gas giants have shuffled around in the past. Teaching the view of the solar system that includes just eight static planets doesn’t do that dynamism justice.</p>



<p>Caltech’s Brown disagrees. Having the gravitational oomph to nudge other bodies in and out of line is an important feature of a world, he says. Plus, the eight planets clearly dominate our solar system, he says. “If you dropped me in the solar system for the first time, and I looked around and saw what was there, nobody would say anything other than, ‘Wow, there are these eight — choose your word — and a lot of other little things.’ ”</p>

<p>Thinking of planets that way leads to big-picture questions about how the solar system put itself together.</p>



<p>One common argument in favor of the IAU’s definition is that it keeps the number of planets manageable. Can you imagine if there were hundreds or thousands of planets? How would the average person keep track of them all? What would we print on lunch boxes? I’m not making fun of this idea; as an astronomy writer who has been obsessed with space since I was 8, I would be reluctant to turn people off to the planets.</p>



<p>But Metzger thinks teaching just eight planets risks turning people off to all the rest of space. “Back in the early 2000s, there was a lot of excitement when astronomers were discovering new planets in our solar system,” he says. “All that excitement ended in 2006.” But those objects are still out there and are still worthy of interest. By now, there are at least 150 of these dwarf planets, and most people have no clue, he says.</p>



<p>This is the argument I find most compelling. Why do we need to limit the number of planets? Kids can memorize the names and characteristics of hundreds of dinosaurs, or Pokémon, for that matter. Why not encourage that for planets? Why not inspire students to rediscover and explore the space objects that most appeal to them?</p>



<p>I’ve come to think that what makes a planet may just be in the eye of the beholders. I may be a lumper, not a splitter, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/663672798/0/oupblogpsychology/">What does the history of Victory Day tell us about Russia’s national identity?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/what-does-the-history-of-victory-day-tell-us-about-russias-national-identity/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1280px-2018_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade_09-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Every year on 9 May, Russia observes Victory Day as its most important national holiday. It celebrates the end of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945) by staging events that dwarf those of any other country. In 2021, the performance in Moscow included 12,000 Russian troops marching through Red Square, followed by tanks and missile launchers, and it concluded with an aerial show of 76 jets and helicopters—one for every year since the victory over Nazi Germany.</p><p>This holiday is designed above all to remind the world of the enormous contributions Russia made in the Great Patriotic War. A few surviving veterans attend the event as a reminder that the Red Army inflicted nearly 90% of all Germany’s combat losses, and civilians across the country solemnly commemorate the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the conflagration (compared, for example, to about 420,000 Americans deaths).</p><p>But Victory Day is not just about the past. It is also about national identity in the present, and as this identity project has changed, so has the memory of the war. In years immediately following 1945, 9 May received scant attention. The country was busy pursuing its global ideological mission of Marxism-Leninism and also in repairing the massive damage it had sustained. But by the end of the 1980s, the declining legitimacy of Communist ideology led authorities to search for other ways to mobilize the population and, in this context, they turned increasingly to Russian nationalism. Among other things, this required a new usable past, giving new meaning to the aphorism: “nothing is so unpredictable as Russia’s past.”</p><p>These transitions were much in evidence in how the Communist Party was depicted in the Great Patriotic War. During the Soviet era, Party members were presented as dedicated, courageous, and selfless fighters at the vanguard of the effort to liberate the USSR and the rest of the world from German fascism. A 1964 Soviet history textbook, for example, told of how troops going on the most dangerous missions said their greatest wish was to be considered a Communist. Textbooks of that era also encouraged students to visit history museums where they could see Communist Party members’ cards pierced by bullet holes and soaked in blood. In this telling, the Party was presented as the leader of the masses as they struggled to rout class enemies in the form of fascist murderers.</p><p>With the collapse of the Soviet Union, this picture underwent a drastic revision. The Party’s legitimacy declined and citizens began expressing doubts and criticisms that would never have been heard in public discourse a few years earlier. Comments that might have been part of private debate “in the kitchen” in Soviet parlance surfaced in the media, memoirs, and even official history textbooks. In the exhilarating discussions of the time, well-established Soviet truths about the Great Patriotic War were replaced by claims that would have landed authors in prison in previous decades.</p><p>For example, a 1995 Russian history textbook blamed the Party-led regime for the fact that the Germans reached the Volga at Stalingrad, something that had never before happened in Russian history. In this new version, it was only when the Party was pushed aside to allow true military professionals to take over that Soviet fortunes improved in the Great Patriotic War, making the Party an <em>impediment</em> rather than a hero in the war effort. The most important new heroes to appear in this post-Soviet narrative were the Russian masses, the Russian nation.</p><p>In short, the transition from the Soviet to post-Soviet era in Russia witnessed a drastic revision in official memory about the most important existential threat of the twentieth century. This might seem to make national memory a fickle servant of political needs, but to leave it at that misses a larger picture. This picture is one a deeper narrative in which the leading actors may change, but the basic plot remains the same. What appears on the surface to be a radical rewrite of national memory turns out to involve the same underlying storyline, and the transition from Soviet to post-Soviet accounts turns out to be a case of telling the same basic story with different characters.</p><p>The stable, underlying story at work in such cases is a “narrative template.” This unconscious narrative code gives rise to mental habits that shape the national memory and national identity more generally. These habits form a coherent perspective that is resistant to change, but one that is also sufficiently protean to accommodate varying accounts of events with their specific dates, places, events, and actors. In the Russian case, the “Expulsion-of-Alien-Enemies” narrative template provides the formula for both the Soviet and post-Soviet account of the Great Patriotic War, and also for other events from previous centuries. It helps explain why the expression “Great Patriotic War” caught on so quickly for Russians in 1941, where the conflict was viewed as another instantiation of the same basic plot for the “Patriotic War” waged against Napoleon more than a century earlier.</p><p>This is a narrative template that shapes Russian understanding of many events in the present as well as the past. For example, it lies behind Vladimir Putin’s frequent beliefs about NATO as a threat—beliefs shared by many Russians but rejected as paranoid by Westerners. All this makes Victory Day an annual event, which, to be sure commemorates the massive losses of the Great Patriotic War, but is also an occasion on which Russians renew their commitment to a national narrative that defines who they are in the twenty-first century.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/663672798/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/663672798/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2f1280px-2018_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade_09-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/663672798/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/science-denial-why-it-happens-and-5-things-you-can-do-about-it/">Science denial: why it happens and 5 things you can do about&#xA0;it</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/shape-and-societal-recovery-from-crises/">SHAPE and societal recovery from crises</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">Climate change made Europe’s flash floods in July more likely</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change has <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/heavy-rainfall-which-led-to-severe-flooding-in-western-europe-made-more-likely-by-climate-change/">increased the likelihood of heavy downpours</a> in Western Europe such as the July rains that led to devastating flash floods, researchers affiliated with the World Weather Attribution network report August 23. Such extreme rains are 1.2 to 9 times more likely to happen — and those downpours are 3 to 19 percent heavier — as a result of human-caused climate change, the team found.</p>



<p>The World Weather Attribution conducts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">quick analyses of extreme events</a> to assess the contribution of climate change (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>). The new study focused on two regions where record-setting rains fell July 12–15 and triggered floods that killed more than 200 people.</p>



<p>In a single day, an average 93 millimeters of rain fell near Germany’s Ahr and Erft rivers; in just two days, 106 millimeters of rain fell in Belgium’s Meuse River region. With many river measurement stations destroyed, the researchers focused on assessing the contribution of climate change to the intense rainfall using climate simulations comparing conditions with and without human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>That intense rainfall might occur once every 400 years under current climate conditions, but those odds are likely to increase as the world continues to warm, said coauthor Maarten van Aalst on August 23 at a news conference on the report. It’s “still a rare event, but a rare event we should prepare for,” said van Aalst, a climate and disaster risk researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.</p>



<p>That finding is consistent with data cited in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report</a>, which notes that as global temperatures continue to rise, western and central Europe will see more intense rainfall events (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-tortoise-video-hunting-killing-eating-baby-bird">A giant tortoise was caught stalking, killing and eating a baby bird</a></h4>

              
                <p>Justin Gerlach thought there must be some sort of misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tortoises don’t hunt. These gentle, lumbering herbivores spend their days leisurely munching on greenery, not stalking prey. His colleague’s report must be mistaken.</p>



<p>But the video was indisputable. On a summer evening in 2020, a female Seychelles giant tortoise (<em>Aldabrachelys gigantea</em>) spent several minutes stalking a young noddy tern (<em>Anous tenuirostris</em>) that had fallen from its nest on Frégate Island in the Seychelles, an archipelago off of East Africa. With plodding determination, the tortoise forced the chick’s retreat down a log, like a pirate walking the plank, until the bird had nowhere to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several slow, deliberate lunges later, the tortoise’s yawning maw caught the bird, crushing its head. Eventually, she swallowed her prize whole. It’s <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00917-9?utm_source=EA">the first documented instance of a tortoise hunting</a>, researchers report August 23 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption>On Frégate Island in the Seychelles, an archipelago off the coast of East Africa, researchers captured the first documented instance of a tortoise — usually a strict herbivore —&nbsp;hunting, killing and eating prey. The giant tortoise stalked a young noddy tern, which fell from its nest, for several minutes before biting and killing the bird.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This was totally unexpected,” says Gerlach, a biologist at the University of Cambridge. Watching the video was “amazing and slightly horrifying.” The footage was captured by coauthor Anna Zora, the conservation and sustainability manager of Frégate Island Sanctuary, the island&#8217;s nature reserve.</p>





<p>Many herbivores will opportunistically scarf down carrion for protein, Gerlach says. And anecdotes of tortoises eating small birds that the reptiles have crushed occasionally surface, “but it’s unclear whether these are deliberate [actions], or they just stepped on something,” he says. Most prey can outrun tortoises, rendering hunting futile. But this grounded noddy tern chick proved easy pickings.</p>





<p>While too young to fly, Gerlach says, the bird could have easily escaped on foot. “But because it’s a tree-nesting bird, ground is a dangerous place.” Once on the log, the chick probably clung to what it knew, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gerlach suspects that this tortoise has hunted before, as its deliberate movements betray prior experience. He plans to investigate whether such hunting behavior occurs with any regularity, but even just this one video has changed his view of these reptiles.</p>



<p>“[People] don&#8217;t think of tortoises as having very interesting behaviors,” he says. “This shows there’s an awful lot more to them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-cool-surface-temperature-failure-lasting-success">Here’s how cool a star can be and still achieve lasting success</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you want to be a successful star by making the minimum possible effort, aim for a surface temperature about a quarter of the sun’s. This is the temperature that a new study says separates red dwarf stars, which shine for a long time, from failed stars known as brown dwarfs.</p>



<p>It’s often hard to distinguish between red and brown dwarfs, because when young they both look the same: red and dim. But only red dwarfs are born with enough mass to sustain the same nuclear reactions that power stars like the sun. In contrast, brown dwarfs glow red primarily from the heat of their birth, but then their nuclear activity sputters out, causing them to cool and fade. Now astrophysicists Dino Hsu and Adam Burgasser at the University of California, San Diego and their colleagues have discerned the dividing line between the two types by exploiting how they move through space.</p>



<p>When a star is born, it revolves around the Milky Way’s center on a fairly circular orbit. Over time, though, gravitational tugs from giant gas clouds, spiral arms and other stars toss the stars to and fro. These perturbations make the stars’ orbits around the galactic center more and more elliptical. Thus, the orbital paths of stars can reveal their approximate age.</p>



<p>Most red dwarfs are fairly old; their predicted lifetimes are far longer than the current age of the universe. But because brown dwarfs cool and fade, any that are still warm are young. Thus, on average, red dwarfs should follow more elliptical orbits around the galaxy than young brown dwarfs do.</p>





<p>In the new study, Hsu’s team analyzed 172 red and brown dwarfs of different spectral types, classifications based on the objects’ spectra that correlate with their surface temperatures. The researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01222">found that a sharp break in stellar motions</a> separates warmer objects, which on average have more elliptical orbits and are older, from cooler ones, which on average have more circular orbits and are younger. This break appears at a spectral type between L4 and L6, corresponding to a surface temperature of about 1200° to 1400° Celsius (1,500 to 1,700 kelvins) — a fraction of the sun&#8217;s surface temperature of about 5500°C (5,800 K) — the team reports July 5 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Above this critical temperature, the dim suns are a mix of long-lived red dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. Below this temperature, though, “it’s all brown dwarfs,” Hsu says. These are the failed stars that are fated to fizzle out. The study will appear in a future issue of the <em>Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.</em></p>



<p>This new method for detecting the temperature boundary between red and brown dwarfs is intriguing, but the result is tentative, says Trent Dupuy, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work. “It’s right around where you would expect,” he says. Dupuy says additional red and brown dwarfs should be observed to verify the finding.</p>



<p>Hsu agrees: “We need a more complete sample.” Expanding the sample will be both easy and hard. On the positive side, red dwarfs abound, outnumbering all other stellar types put together, and brown dwarfs are also common. On the negative side, though, red and brown dwarfs are faint. That makes measuring their Doppler shifts, which reveal how fast the objects move toward or away from Earth, a challenge. But knowing this motion is essential for calculating a star’s orbital path around the galaxy.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Resilience allows you to bounce back when <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">things get hard</a>, whether that’s something as small as a bad day in the office or more serious adverse events. And while it can be easy to think of resilience as something we either do or don’t have, research suggests that isn’t the case: rather, our level of resilience changes in different contexts.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10596011211027676">new study</a>, published in <em>Group &amp; Organization Management, </em>looks closely at resilience in the workplace. It, too, finds that resilience isn’t a static phenomenon, and that it should be seen as something distinctly more flexible instead.</p>



<span id="more-43298"></span>



<p>Participants were members of a marching band at a university in the United States, chosen because of the high levels of commitment and effort that were required for them to remain on top of performances and practice. Participants first indicated whether or not they were new to the band and completed a measure of emotional stability, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I change my mood a lot”.</p>



<p>Then, every week over a twelve week period, participants completed scales measuring emotional exhaustion (e.g. “I feel emotionally drained”) and commitment (e.g. “I feel a strong sense of belonging to the marching band”), and stated how high their workload was. Finally, at the end of the period participants indicated whether they <em>intended</em> to stay in the band. The researchers also looked at whether they actually remained in the band during the next season.</p>



<p>As the term and study went on, band members felt that their workload increased, with more demands being placed on them. This increased workload was also accompanied by increasing feelings of burnout and emotional exhaustion, and decreasing levels of commitment and belonging.</p>



<p><a></a>This increase in feelings of burnout across the course of the study was similar for people who were high and low in emotional stability. However, when it came to commitment, those higher in emotional stability were more likely to remain committed and retain feelings of belonging than those low in the trait, who experienced a slow decline throughout the twelve weeks. Those new to the group were also more likely to remain engaged than those who had been members for a longer period of time, and showed less of an increase in burnout over the course of the 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Trajectories that show less of an increase in burnout and continued commitment in the face of increased workload are reflective of resilience, write the authors. So the key takeaway from the results is that resilience isn’t simply a case of personal character. Though emotional stability did impact how committed participants were, other factors including how long they’d been involved in the band also influenced these trajectories.</p>



<p>As you might expect, there was also a relationship between feelings of commitment and intent to stay in the band. Those who remained at the same level of commitment (or whose commitment increased across the course of the study) were more likely to say they wanted to return to the band, and to actually do so. Levels of resilience, therefore, had a material impact on the make-up of the band and participants’ experience of being part of it.</p>



<p>The study shows that resilience is a process, the authors say — one that fluctuates over time rather than staying stable. This may make annual employee surveys somewhat moot, they argue: because they happen only once a year, they’re unable to capture the shifting complexities of resilience, burnout, and likelihood of employee retention, which are likely to change from month to month, project to project, and person to person. Taking a more flexible approach to resilience — as well as employee wellbeing more generally — could be a better way of maintaining a healthier workplace.</p>



<p>Future research could look at protective factors: are there things that groups or organisations can do internally to foster resilience, belonging and commitment? <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/18/when-bosses-are-respectful-young-people-are-more-resilient-at-work-and-enjoy-their-jobs-more/">Other recent research</a>, for example, has looked at the positive impact of cultures of respect within workplaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-number-line-space-map-different-directions">Everyone maps numbers in space. But why don’t we all use the same directions?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consider a ruler, a timeline or even weights lined up in a gym. Why are the smaller values, the earlier times and the lighter weights typically on the left and the larger or later values on the right? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Since at least <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-44067-001">the early 1990s,</a> researchers have debated whether these mental number lines, or the tendency to order numerically from left to right, are innate or learned. In more recent years, this debate has broadened from mental number lines to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839568/">mental magnitude lines:</a> the human tendency to map any abstract idea, such as numbers, time and even facial expressions, in three-dimensional space. Now, an August 11 study in <em>Science Advances, </em>comparing mostly adult Indigenous farmer-foragers in Bolivia to U.S. preschoolers and adults has <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/33/eabg4141">fallen squarely on the learning or culture side,</a> adding fresh fuel to the debate.</p>



<p>For these Bolivians, known as the Tsimane people, “numbers increase in one direction. Time increases in one direction. Size increases in one direction. But any direction will do,” says cognitive scientist Benjamin Pitt of the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, with little formal schooling telling them which way to position numbers in space, the Tsimane people do not care, in theory, if heavier dumbbells sit on the right or the left.</p>



<p>More than an esoteric debate, researchers suspect that understanding how humans map abstract ideas in space could provide clues about the development of spatial reasoning. The thinking is that these maps “are a foundation upon which later mathematical and spatial abilities build,” says cognitive scientist Kensy Cooperrider, who recently completed his postdoctoral work at the University of Chicago and is now based in San Diego.</p>





<p>Pitt and colleagues first asked members of three groups — 96 Tsimane teens and adults, 31 U.S. preschoolers and 18 U.S. adults — to arrange items on a horizontal board. All the participants lined up five index cards covered in one to five dots or five blocks ranging in size from 1 to 5 inches. While the U.S. adults all mapped the cards and blocks from smallest on the left to largest on the right, the Tsimane adults and U.S. preschoolers were equally likely to map in either direction, the team found.</p>



<p>Then the team evaluated how a new group of 60 Tsimane teens and adults mapped information along the x, y and sagittal (front to back) axes. Besides asking participants to order items by size and number, the researchers also tested to see whether the Tsimane people mapped time to space. In that trial, the team asked them to order five sets of bananas ranging in color, or ripeness, from very green to almost black. Each participant completed three mapping tasks per axis for a total of nine tasks.</p>



<p>Again, the Tsimane people showed little directional bias. A single participant often ordered one concept one way on a given axis, such as the lower magnitude green bananas on the bottom, and another concept the other way, such as the higher magnitude five-dot index card on the bottom. The researchers tallied when each participant placed all the cards in the same direction on a given axis and when they did not. Averaging the scores across participants, the researchers found that mappings went in the same direction only 42 percent of the time.</p>



<p>“This study casts doubt on the idea that many psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have held that we have an innate system for spatializing numbers,” says Cooperrider, who reached similar conclusions in a 2017 study testing <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617691548">mental number lines among the Yupno people</a> of Papua, New Guinea.</p>



<p>The debate is far from closed, though, says cognitive scientist Stella Lourenco of Emory University in Atlanta. Tsimane participants did show some consistencies. For instance, any given individual ordered the size and number cards the same way along the x, y and sagittal axes about 80 percent of the time. “They look at these data and say there is inconsistency. I look at these data and I say, ‘It looks pretty good to me in terms of consistency,’” Lourenco says.</p>



<p>Lourenco suspects that people might be born with innate mental maps, as indicated by research on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676679/">newborn babies</a>, but life experience obscures those default tendencies. For instance, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07534-007">Arabic speakers</a>, who read from right to left, also tend to place lower magnitude items on the right — the reverse of native English speakers. “Even if you believe in a default or innate directionality,” she says, “directionality is flexible.”</p>



<p>The bigger question, says cognitive scientist Rosa Rugani of the University of Padua in Italy, is how people build their mental maps. What experiences, for instance, make Tsimane people more likely to map the number and size cards in the same direction than the number and time cards?</p>



<p>What’s more, Rugani says, a laser focus on directionality has obscured what’s arguably the most intriguing question of all: Why does everyone from preschoolers to the Yupno and Tsimane people map abstract ideas in space at all? “We really need to return to the origins of this topic,” she says.</p>

<h4>Neuroscience mysteries</h4>



<p><em>A three-dimensional look at 50,000 brain cells taken from a woman with epilepsy uncovered some pairs with an astonishingly large number of connections, <strong>Laura Sanders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-map-neurons-connections-google-harvard">An intricate brain map reveals quirks</a>” (</em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>Given that nerve cells usually touch once, reader <strong>Leilani</strong> wondered if the woman’s epilepsy could be the reason for the cells’ multiple connections.</p>



<p>The researchers don’t think epilepsy is responsible for this cellular quirk, <strong>Sanders</strong> says, but for now, we can’t be sure. “The tissue that scientists used to reconstruct the map was thought to be healthy, normal tissue that was removed to allow access to the spot in the woman’s brain where seizures started. But it’s possible that abnormal neural activity influenced the cells in that supposedly healthy tissue too,” she says. “Until scientists have more maps that are made from a wider variety of brains, we won’t know how common any of these ‘rare’ findings actually are.”</p>





<h4>Frankly, my deer, I don’t give a slam</h4>



<p><em>Gray wolves in Wisconsin that use roads as travel corridors may scare deer away, reducing deer-vehicle collisions, <strong>Jack J. Lee</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gray-wolves-scare-deer-roads-reduce-car-collisions">Gray wolves clear deer from roadways</a>” (</em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>John Hosack</strong> asked if this wolf behavior leads to increased wolf-vehicle collisions.</p>



<p>Wolf-vehicle collisions occur, <strong>Lee</strong> says, but less frequently than deer-vehicle collisions do. According to the <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/sites/default/files/topic/WildlifeHabitat/wolfreport2020.pdf">Wisconsin Gray Wolf Monitoring Report</a>, there were 21 wolf-vehicle collisions in the state from April 2019 to April 2020. That number is much lower than the nearly 20,000 deer-vehicle collisions that occur in the state each year. Gray wolves’ small population size likely contributes to the low numbers, <strong>Lee </strong>says. But wolves may also tend to avoid roads with heavy traffic. A study in the April 2020 <em>Mammalian Biology</em> found that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42991-020-00014-0">wolves in Poland prefer to travel along high-traffic forest roads</a> when there was low human activity.</p>



<h4>Bound by biology</h4>



<p><em>HIV’s ability to create myriad variants in a single person partly explains why scientists haven’t been able to find an effective vaccine, <strong>Erin Garcia de Jesús</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies">Why HIV vaccines remain elusive</a>” (</em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 14<em>).</em></p>



<p>Given this high rate of mutation, reader <strong>Art Hager</strong> wanted to know why HIV hasn’t found ways to spread through the air or through mosquitoes.</p>



<p>Even HIV has its limits, <strong>Garcia de Jesús</strong> says. The virus doesn’t last long outside the body, and the changes it would have to undergo to spread in alternative ways would likely be more trouble than they’re worth and wouldn&#8217;t happen in real life, she says. “Let’s pretend that HIV is a small animal living on a mountain. This animal wants to get from peak A to peak B, but the valley in between is filled with wolves. The creature looks to peak C, but that valley has a lake that is impossible to cross. So it might as well stay on peak A where there’s plenty of food and space, even if there are a few hawks flying around.”</p>



<h4>What gives, eggsactly?</h4>



<p><em>An experiment on the International Space Station suggests that space radiation doesn’t affect the viability of sperm, <strong>Maria Temming</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-sperm-dna-space-radiation-exposure-six-years">After spending years in space, mouse sperm produce healthy pups</a>” (</em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Suzan Chastain</strong> wondered whether eggs are similarly unaffected by space radiation.</p>



<p>More research is needed to understand how eggs fare in space, says biologist <strong>Teruhiko Wakayama</strong> of the University of Yamanashi in Kōfu, Japan. Long-term experiments with mouse eggs are challenging because, unlike freeze-dried sperm, the eggs must be stored at temperatures of about –196° Celsius and the freezers on the International Space Station don’t get that cold, <strong>Wakayama</strong> says. His team next plans to do a short-term experiment on the space station that will investigate microgravity’s effects on developing mouse embryos. The embryos will be stored for one to two weeks in freezers at –95° C.</p>

<h3>See the forest for the trees</h3>



<p>Conserving big, old trees such as baobabs (shown below) in Madagascar, can slow the devastation of climate change, <strong>Susan Milius</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">First, protect today’s forests</a>” (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 24</em>). The story reminded reader <strong>@StephenChuaEOS</strong> of the beloved children’s book <em>The Little Prince</em>. On Twitter, he shared the little prince’s simple philosophy: “It’s a question of discipline.… When you’ve finished washing and dressing each morning, you must tend your planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-over-pluto-planet-status-still-carries-on">Debate over Pluto’s planet status still carries on</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fifteen years ago, Pluto was kicked out of the planet club. On August 24, 2006, members of the International Astronomical Union voted in favor of a new definition of what constitutes a planet. What was once considered the solar system’s ninth planet no longer qualified.</p>



<p>The public outcry was immediate. “In changing the definition of <em>planet</em>, the International Astronomical Union is messing with something much bigger than it is,” one<em> Science News</em> reader complained in a letter to the editor. “Think of all the dictionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks and websites that will need revision.”</p>



<p>Many planetary scientists were upset too, though mostly for other reasons. As astronomy writer Lisa Grossman explains in this issue, some researchers thought the new definition — that a planet is a spherical body that orbits the sun (which Pluto is) and has cleared other objects out of its orbit (which Pluto hasn’t) — was too restrictive. Some scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">still lobby for a broader definition</a>.</p>



<p>The debate over classifying solar system objects reminds me of another classification challenge: categorizing the diversity of life on Earth. As a child, I remember learning about the five kingdoms of life: animals, plants, fungi, protists (things like algae) and monerans (bacteria). Though there was never a vote (that I’m aware of), that system was superceded. In the 1990s, biologists proposed new groups such as domains — bacteria, archaea (unicellular organisms that had once been considered bacteria) and eukaryotes. More recently, scientists have debated how to organize eukaryotes, organisms that store DNA within a cell nucleus. For example, did you know you’re an opisthokont? According to some biologists, all animals, fungi and some single-celled eukaryotes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">fall into that “supergroup”</a> (<em>SN: 8/8/15, p. 22</em>). The name, roughly meaning “rear pole,” references the fact that many opisthokonts have at least some cells powered by a whiplike tail. Animals, for instance, have sperm. But I doubt many schoolchildren would cry if we lost our membership in this group, as they did over Pluto’s “demotion.”</p>



<p>Categorizing life is an ongoing process, and even the definition of life itself is uncertain, with questions about whether viruses should be considered alive. Still, classification is more than just semantics. These groupings serve a purpose; they reveal our place in nature and help us understand how life has evolved. As new information, particularly genetic information, has come in, scientists have realized that some groupings had been based on superficial similarities and have revised the taxonomy accordingly.</p>



<p>Classification holds a similar purpose in planetary science and is also subject to new information. As Grossman shows, the 2006 vote didn’t end debate over what defines a planet. Some scientists now argue that interesting geology is the true hallmark, which would make many solar system objects eligible for a status upgrade. Though this broader definition of a planet may never be put to a vote, we’d love to know whether you think it’s a plausible alternative.

<p><strong>The W particle may have been found</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-may-have-been-found"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 21, 1971</p>



<p>Physicists distinguish four different kinds of force by which objects in the universe act upon each other: the strong nuclear force, the weak force, electromagnetism and gravity. The developed theory of particle physics outfits each force with a so-called intermediate particle.… Now, from an abandoned silver mine at Park City, Utah, comes strong evidence of the existence of the weak-force quantum, known as the … W particle.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The “strong evidence” for this W particle, or W boson, fell apart under additional scrutiny. Physicists with CERN near Geneva finally <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-physics-missing-link-found">caught the boson</a> about a decade later (<em>SN: 2/5/83, p. 84</em>). Besides helping mediate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">the weak force</a>, which governs certain types of radioactive decay, the W boson has also helped scientists catch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">the Higgs boson</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/12, p. 5</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/higgs-running-out-hiding-places">Weighing the W boson</a> narrowed down the Higgs’ mass range, making the Higgs easier to look for. Physicists continue unraveling W boson mysteries, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03256-1">how the particles form</a> and whether <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2021-026/">more massive versions</a> exist.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ancient-horseshoe-crab-brain">How fossilization preserved a 310-million-year-old horseshoe crab’s brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paleontologists can spend years carefully splitting rocks in search of the perfect fossil. But with a 310-million-year-old horseshoe crab brain, nature did the work, breaking the fossil in just the right way to reveal the ancient arthropod’s central nervous system.</p>



<p>Of all soft tissues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-fossilized-dinosaur-brain-unearthed-scientists-claim">brains</a> are notoriously difficult to preserve in any form (<em>SN: 10/31/16</em>). Stumbling across such a detailed specimen purely by chance was “a one-in-a-million find, if not rarer,” says evolutionary paleontologist Russell Bicknell of the University of New England in Armidale, Australia.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G49193.1/606398/Central-nervous-system-of-a-310-m-y-old-horseshoe">fossilized brain</a> is remarkably similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, giving clues to the arthropods’ evolution, Bicknell and colleagues report July 26 in <em>Geology</em>. And the brain’s peculiar mode of preservation could point paleontologists toward new places to look for hard-to-find fossils of soft tissues.</p>



<p>Horseshoe crabs have a fossil record spanning roughly 445 million years. But having a long fossil record is one thing. For many animals, including the crabs, fossils of their soft tissues are extremely uncommon because the tissues tend to degrade far quicker than fossilization can occur. Finding the delicate fatty structures that form a brain preserved in rock is especially rare. Only about 20 samples of fossilized arthropod neural tissue have been identified to date.</p>





<p>The newly described brain — part of a larger fossil of the extinct <em>Euproops danae</em> that Bicknell found at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History — was originally dug up from the Mazon Creek fossil beds roughly an hour southwest of Chicago. That site is one of the only known places in the world that could have saved the brain’s structure, says paleontologist Victoria McCoy of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.</p>



<p>“The fossilization at Mazon Creek is really, really exceptional,” McCoy explains. “It’s interesting because the fossils are preserved inside concretions,” which are spherical rocks that form around a central nugget of material, such as a long-dead crab. Most concretions in other fossil beds have no fossils or fossils that are just bones and hard parts, but “Mazon Creek has really good, soft-tissue preservation inside these concretions,” she says.</p>



<p>That’s because the concretions there are partly made of an iron-carbonate mineral called siderite that only forms in low-oxygen environments. That low-oxygen setting almost certainly slowed tissue decay, the scientists say, giving it time to be preserved. In an oxygenated environment, the decay could have happened in weeks, and the brain would have probably wasted away too quickly.</p>



<p>The actual process of preservation was a multistep ordeal, Bicknell says. “First, of course, the horseshoe crab had to die.” As the crab decayed, surrounded by mud and not much oxygen, that siderite coated the crab’s body, allowing it and its fragile brain structure to be preserved. After the brain degraded, the siderite “mold” was filled in with a pale, clay mineral called kaolinite, creating a white brain structure that stands out starkly on the otherwise tan fossil. Over time, a sphere of rock formed around the fossil before eventually breaking open in a fortuitous way.</p>

Bicknell <em>et al</em>/<em>Geology</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on studies in similar modern environments, such as the North Norfolk marshes in England, the whole preservation process probably took fewer than 50 years, McCoy says. That’s much faster than some other fossilization processes, which can take thousands of years or more. “Neural tissue degrades fairly quickly. We have no reason to think it would be stable,” she says. “While we don’t completely understand how concretions form, all the evidence so far is that it’s the concretion itself that is the preservation force keeping things from decaying away.”</p>



<p>The high preservation quality in these siderite concretions may point paleontologists in new directions for finding soft-tissue fossils. Only several environments capable of producing siderite concretions in the rock record have been identified so far, but the sites could be practical targets for future fossil searches.</p>



<p>“The most important part here is that purely by chance, the fossil was split along its brain,” Bicknell says. The concretion was cracked in just the right orientation to reveal a near-perfect cross section of the brain’s structure. “If it hadn’t broken that way, we wouldn’t have this level of information. It was ultimately quite lucky.”</p>



<p>The preserved central nervous system lends insight into the ancient crab’s behavior, the researchers say. Because the fossil brain is so similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, Bicknell says, it’s safe to say the ancient animal’s walking, breathing and even feeding habits were probably similar to horseshoe crabs’ today, including eating with their legs. “Imagine eating a hamburger with your elbows,” Bicknell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sports-soccer-ghost-games-psychology-fans-referee-pandemic">‘Ghost games’ spotlight the psychological effect fans have on referees</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the fans are away, the home team loses its sway, new research suggests.<br><br>During the 2019–2020 season, European soccer teams played in front of vacant stadium seats <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans">due to COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). Home teams won less, lost more and tied about the same, compared with the season before the pandemic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Frontiers in Sports and Active Living</em>. What’s more, referees doled out much more foul calls to home teams than before during these crowdless “ghost games.”</p>



<p>The findings add to evidence that fans influence home team advantage — the phenomenon where athletes tend to do better on their own turf. “No fans, no home advantage,” says sports psychologist Fabio Richlan of the University of Salzburg in Austria.</p>



<p>Richlan and Michael Leitner, a sports psychologist also at the University of Salzburg, compared the outcomes of 645 games for the 2018–2019 season with the outcomes of 641 ghost games for the 2019–2020 season. Countries included in the analysis were Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and Czech Republic.</p>



<p>With stands mostly or entirely empty, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.720488/full">home team win rate decreased</a> by 8.3 percentage points, from 48.1 percent to 39.8 percent, the researchers found. Meanwhile, loss rate increased by 8.4 percentage points, from 27.6 percent to 36 percent.</p>



<p>To examine how fan pressure on referees might have contributed to the discrepancy, the researchers looked at how often referees issued foul calls in the form of yellow cards. With fans absent, foul calls against home teams increased by around 26 percent, while calls against away teams increased by only about 3 percent.  <br><br>“Referees indeed give advantage to the home teams, because of the crowds,” Leitner says. But the findings suggest that referee bias tends to disappear when fans do. While it’s natural for people to change their opinions under pressure from others, Leitner says, hopefully this work can help referees become more aware of their biases. “When you know it, you can train against it.”</p>
