<p>This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper "Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-ebola-outbreak-start-survivor-person-infected-years-ago">The latest Ebola outbreak may have started with someone infected years ago</a></h4>

<p>The ongoing Ebola outbreak in Guinea was most likely sparked by someone infected during the outbreak seven years ago, a new study shows. Viruses from both outbreaks are almost genetically identical, hinting that the virus did not jump from an animal to people, as scientists expected, but that it had lurked hidden in a human body for years.</p>



<p>“With this news, I was really, really shocked,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Potential cases of Ebola began emerging in the West African nation in late January, and Guinean health officials declared an outbreak on February 13 after <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-february-2021-ebola-gin/en/">three people tested positive</a> for the virus. The region hadn’t seen an outbreak since the one in 2013<strong>–</strong>2016, which claimed over 11,000 lives. A <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/ebola-2021-north-kivu">separate, unrelated outbreak in the Congo</a> was declared on February 7.</p>



<p>As of March 6, <a href="https://www.africa-newsroom.com/press/africa-union-member-states-reporting-ebola-virus-disease-update-6-march-2021?lang=en">29 cases and 13 deaths</a> had been reported in both countries, according to Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A genetic analysis found that four viruses from people infected in the Guinea outbreak were the close relatives of viruses that had infected people in 2014, according to a <a href="https://virological.org/t/guinea-2021-ebov-genomes/651">trio</a> of <a href="https://virological.org/t/guinea-2021-ebov-outbreak/643">preliminary</a> <a href="https://virological.org/t/release-4-ebov-genomes-from-guinea-2021-outbreak/642">reports</a> posted March 12 at virological.org. Only about a dozen mutations separate these new cases from the 2014 cases. That’s far fewer than the more than 100 mutations scientists expect would accumulate over that period if there were sustained transmission of the virus.</p>





<p>The lack of mutations suggests that the newest outbreak did not get its start when a bat virus jumped into humans and began spreading. Rather, the most recent cases appear to be a resurgence of the same strain that caused the 2013<strong>–</strong>2016 Ebola outbreak, carried by someone who was infected back then.</p>



<p>Researchers have known that Ebola virus can stick around in the body after recovery. Some cases in West Africa during the 2013<strong>–</strong>2016 outbreak stemmed from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30417-1/fulltext">individuals who had been infected and had recovered months</a>, or even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585800/">more than a year</a>, earlier. But the new findings show the most recent outbreak began after a five-year lull in cases and suggest that the virus wasn’t replicating during that time, meaning the virus may have gone dormant.</p>



<p>The finding “suggests some sort of weird mechanism that hasn’t been seen before,” Rasmussen says, but doesn’t mean that Ebola outbreaks from dormant viruses in humans are going to be happening all the time. Right now, what might have happened is “a mystery. We’ll probably solve [the mechanism], but right now there’s just not very much known about it.”</p>



<p>Other recent research backs up the idea that Ebola can lie low in the body for years. Immune proteins that recognize the virus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03146-y">spiked in the blood in 39 out of 51 people</a> months after those people recovered, molecular virologist Georgios Pollakis and colleagues reported in the Feb. 18 <em>Nature</em>. Though the team could not find evidence in the blood that the virus was replicating, the roused immune response hints that the virus could be hiding somewhere in the body.</p>



<p>“We were quite surprised to see [that] data,” says Pollakis, of the University of Liverpool in England.</p>



<p>For Pollakis, the new developments emphasize the need for continued surveillance and research on diseases that aren’t top-of-mind. “The biggest lesson is that public health needs serious investment,” Pollakis says. “We focus on what is [spreading] faster, on the biggest player. And then we leave the virus that doesn’t seem to be a burden for the moment… now it comes back to haunt us.” </p>



<p>Though experts say transmission of the virus from people infected long ago appears to be rare, the outbreak raises fears that Ebola survivors could face new stigmas.</p>



<p>Health officials have sprung into action across the region to isolate potential contacts in the current outbreak and vaccinate them and their contacts, a strategy known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-about-ebola-outbreak-congo-and-vaccine-help">ring vaccination</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/18</em>). In Guinea, about 500 contacts have been identified, and over 1,600 people vaccinated as of March 5.</p>



<p>Still, public health officials may need to alter Ebola vaccination strategies, Rasmussen says. While the current strategy is to control outbreaks with ring vaccination, “we need to think about maybe having a mass immunization campaign — not using vaccination as a control strategy but as a prevention strategy.”  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-perceptions-diversity-vary-race-political-views">How perceptions of diversity vary by race and political views</a></h4>

<p>In the wake of the past year’s Black Lives Matter protests, achieving “diversity” across domains has become a pressing societal concern.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf2507">“diversity” means different things to different people</a>, sociologist Janet Xu of Princeton University and colleagues report March 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. That means devising ways to turn talk of diversity into action — for instance, diversifying a workforce or a neighborhood — can be subjective.  </p>



<p>“Americans almost always talk about diversity in this positive but very, very ambiguous light,” Xu says. “So people can agree that diversity is good without agreeing on what diversity actually looks like.”</p>



<p>Xi and colleagues focused on racial diversity. The team tested what that looks like to different groups of people by showing them hypothetical neighborhoods, each with different racial and ethnic makeups. The team surveyed 1,803 U.S. adults split almost evenly among four groups — white, Black, Latino and Asian. All the neighborhoods had one dominant group, making up 50 to 90 percent of residents, one midsize group and one minority group making up just 2 percent.</p>





<p>Participants ranked eight hypothetical neighborhoods presented in pairs on perceived diversity, using a seven-point scale, with 1 being the least diverse and 7 being the most. In general, regardless of their race, participants ranked neighborhoods where the dominant group made up only half the population as more diverse than ones in which it made up 90 percent.</p>



<p>However, compared with white participants, Latino, Black and Asian participants rated neighborhoods about a third of a point more diverse when their own group was in the majority. White people, meanwhile, ranked neighborhoods as equally diverse regardless of which group dominated. That finding could help explain why, as recent research suggests, underrepresented minorities often feel out of place even in purportedly diverse settings, Xu says. </p>



<p>Differences in perception also emerged between liberal and conservative white people, the team found. Those who support affirmative action and want more immigration perceived that neighborhoods in which another racial group made up the majority of residents, particularly if the group was Black, were the most diverse. But white respondents opposing such policies perceived white-majority neighborhoods as more diverse than Black-majority neighborhoods.</p>



<p>This divergence in white people’s beliefs has also shown up in other research, says sociologist Daniel Hirschman of Brown University in Providence, R.I. “The attitudes of white liberals are looking more and more like nonwhite people.”</p>



<p>Given competing perceptions of diversity, Xu and colleagues suggest making diversity goals more explicit. But exactly how to do that is challenging: Courts have often struck down efforts to quantify diversity, such as quotas. Instead, Xu says, a starting point to building inclusion is to recognize that people’s perceptions play into their understanding of diversity. One way to proceed, she suggests, is to have all people in a given setting answer the question: Do you think this place is diverse? </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cone-snail-venom-sea-worms-pheromones">Cone snail venom may trick mate-seeking worms into becoming meals</a></h4>

<p>Normally, it takes the ghostly light of the full moon to coax certain worms from hiding on the seafloor to mate. Out in the open, sex-inducing chemicals kick off a swirling dance that culminates in a moonlit shower of eggs and sperm.</p>



<p>But just a whiff of cone snail venom might also get the worms in the mood.</p>



<p><em>Conus imperialis</em> venom contains <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf2704">two molecules that mimic bristle worm pheromones</a> and can stimulate mating behaviors, researchers report March 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The find raises the possibility that the cone snails are “weaponizing the worms’ own pheromone as a sort of lure,” says Joshua Torres, a medicinal chemist at the University of Copenhagen. “It’s really wild.”</p>



<p>Cone snails pack their potent venom into self-made harpoons, which they then fling into fish, mollusks or worms. The venom of each of the more than 700 cone snail species is a treasure trove of chemicals that hijack specific physiological pathways in their prey. For example, one cone snail species produces its own fish insulin that saps prey’s blood sugar, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cone-snail-deploys-insulin-slow-speedy-prey">making a lethargic target</a>. (<em>SN: 1/19/15</em>). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Cone snail venom houses pheromone-mimicking molecules that might be used by the snails to lure worms from hiding, making an easier meal.</figure>



<p>The venom’s specificity of action has attracted drug researchers looking for inspiration. A morphinelike painkiller called Prialt, for example, stemmed from cone snails. Torres and his colleagues were keen to scour the venom of <em>C. imperialis</em>, a cosmopolitan species that hunts worms, for possible drugs. Chemical analysis revealed two compounds — Conazolium A and genuanine — that piqued the researchers’ interest.</p>





<p>To Torres’ surprise, these small molecules didn’t seem to target neuromuscular pathways and impair their function, like many venom constituents. But the molecules were remarkably similar to some bristle worms’ mating pheromones. Chemically, the snail’s mimics are actually more stable than the worm’s natural pheromones, which degrade relatively quickly after release, Torres says. The match seemed too perfect to be coincidental.</p>



<p>While venom usually does its dirty work via injection, there are some examples of cone snails releasing chemicals into the water column. To test the lure hypothesis, the researchers exposed <em>Platynereis dumerilii</em> worms in petri dishes to the pheromone mimics and watched. When hit with the snail chemicals, 13 of 16 males in the experiment released sperm, and seven of 11 females began swirling around in tight circles — a precursor to mating. While <em>C. imperialis</em> isn’t known to eat this specific worm, the researchers found the DNA of close relatives in the guts of some snails, suggesting that the compounds could be used against more common prey, such as fireworms.</p>



<p>“Cone snails are full of surprises, and this paper raises an exciting possibility,” says Thomas Duda, a zoologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study. “The next step needs to be figuring out how this actually works in nature.”</p>



<p><em>C. imperialis</em>’ hunting behavior is mostly known from laboratory studies, where the worms are sitting ducks for snails, Torres says. In the wild, however, the worms spend time hidden below sediment and under crevices. Observations in more natural settings could confirm whether <em>C. imperialis</em>’ specialized venom entices worms with the promise of a mate, only to become a meal.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-survivors-ptsd-mental-health">Some COVID-19 survivors face another foe: PTSD</a></h4>

<p>The sickest of COVID-19 patients struggle to breathe. Facing a disease new to science, they’re isolated from their loved ones and treated by doctors and nurses in hazmat suits. Now, a small study in Italy finds that nearly a third of people who were very ill with COVID-19 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2776722">developed post-traumatic stress disorder</a> after acute infection.</p>



<p>Psychiatrist Delfina Janiri of Agostino Gemelli University Policlinic in Rome and colleagues assessed the mental health of 381 severely ill COVID-19 patients an average of 100 days after symptoms first appeared. About 30 percent, or 115 people, were diagnosed with PTSD, the team reports February 18 in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>. Depression and anxiety also turned up in these patients, though not as frequently. PTSD was more common among women, people who had a history of psychiatric disorders, and people who experienced delirium or agitation while very sick with COVID-19.</p>



<p>The rate of PTSD is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2215-0366%2820%2930203-0">comparable to that of survivors of other coronavirus infections</a> such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as well as natural disasters, the researchers say. About 30 percent of New Orleans residents who survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and its aftermath developed PTSD.</p>

<h3>Lingering effect</h3>





<p>In a small study in Rome, about 30 percent of patients who had recovered from severe COVID-19 went on to develop PTSD. The rate is comparable to that of survivors of the coronavirus infections MERS and SARS, as well as survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/four-lost-cities-a-secret-history-of-the-urban-age-9781665115629/9780393652666">Four Lost Cities</a><br /><em>Annalee Newitz<br />W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $26.95</em></p>



<p>It’s a familiar trope in movies and books: A bright-eyed protagonist moves to the big city in search of fame and fortune. Amid the bustle and lights, all hopes and dreams come true. But why do we cling to this cliché? In <em>Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age</em>, author Annalee Newitz explores ancient settlements to find out why people flock to big cities — and why they leave.  </p>



<p>The book is divided into four enjoyable, snack-sized sections, one for each city. Each section is accompanied by a handy map, drawn by artist Jason Thompson with engaging, cartoon-style flair.</p>



<p>Rather than dry history, Newitz makes a special effort to highlight the oddities and innovations that made these cities unique. Take Çatalhöyük, the oldest city they feature, which thrived from 7500 to 5700 B.C. in what is now Turkey. This ancient city persisted for nearly 2,000 years despite lacking things that we might consider necessary to a city, such as roads, dedicated public spaces or shopping areas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="illustrated map of Çatalhöyük" class="wp-image-3097310" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030221_bb_four-lost-cities_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097310"><em>Four Lost Cities </em>includes illustrated maps, including this one of Çatalhöyük, to help guide readers, as well as offering a bit of insight into the art of ancient cultures.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097310">Jason Thompson</span></figure>



<p>Newitz’s also explores Pompeii (700 B.C to A.D. 79 in modern-day Italy). When paired with Çatalhöyük, it offers insights into how humans developed the distinction between public and private spaces and activities — ideas that would not have made sense before humans began living in large settled groups. The section on Cahokia (A.D. 1050 to 1350) — located in what is now Illinois, across the Mississippi River from St. Louis — offers an unexpected reason for a city’s emergence. Many people link cities with capitalism and trade. Cahokia’s 30-meter-tall pyramids, 20-hectare plazas and a population (at the time) bigger than Paris suggest that spiritual revival can also build a major metropolis. Cahokia and Angkor, which reached its peak from A.D. 800 to 1431 in what is now Cambodia, also show how cities can form when power gets concentrated in a few influential people. </p>



<p>Through touring such diverse cities, Newitz shows that the move to urban life isn’t just a setup for a hero of a story. It’s a common setup for many ancient cultures.</p>







<p>Each city, of course, eventually fell. Çatalhöyük and Angkor suffered from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-system-helped-angkor-rise-may-have-also-brought-its-fall">droughts and flooding</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>). Pompeii felt the fury of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-vesuvius-suffocated-not-vaporized-some-victims">a volcano</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/20</em>). But Newitz also reveals something else: Collapsing infrastructure provided the final push that kept people away. Here we glimpse our potential future, as climate crises and political instability threaten our own urban networks. But Newitz’s vivid imaginings, bright prose and boundless enthusiasm manage to keep the tone optimistic. These cities did end, yes. Yet the people who built them and resided in them lived on. Even in Pompeii, many inhabitants made it out. Collectively, they went to new places and spurred new growth.</p>



<p><em>Four Lost Cities</em> is about how cities collapse. But it’s also about what makes a city succeed. It’s not glamour or Wall Street. It’s not good restaurants or big factories. It’s people and their infrastructure. It’s clean water, public spaces, decent roads and opportunities for residents to live with dignity and improve their lot, Newitz explains. And when infrastructure crumbles beyond repair, people inevitably move on. “Our forebears’ eroded palaces and villas warn us about how communities can go wrong,” they write. “But their streets and plazas testify to all the times we built something meaningful together.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-year-scientists-who">The COVID-19 pandemic is now a year old. What have scientists learned?</a></h4>

<p>One year ago, the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-who-pandemic">declared that the novel coronavirus outbreak was a pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 3/11/20</em>). Little did we know the uncertainty, anxiety, frustration and loss that was in store. It’s been a year that’s felt never-ending. It’s tested us all. It’s cost millions of lives, even as we’ve made remarkably rapid strides in understanding this new foe and finding ways to fight it.</p>



<p>Now, as more and more people get vaccinated against COVID-19, there’s hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.</p>



<p>We asked five scientists who are among the many who have jumped in to tackle the coronavirus what has surprised them about the past year and what they’ve learned that could help us all as we enter the second year of the pandemic. Their answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.  </p>



<h4>What has surprised you over the past year?</h4>





<p><strong>Rajesh Gandhi</strong>, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston: What really hits home is that we were not prepared, despite concerns that have been raised for many years that this was coming. We had to essentially prepare and implement our response to the pandemic during the pandemic, as opposed to before.</p>



<p><strong>Damir Huremovic</strong>, a psychiatrist with Northwell Health in Manhasset, N.Y.: We constantly keep doing the wrong things; we can’t get our act together. That is probably because of some of the features of this virus. It’s sitting on the border of very dangerous and not so dangerous. It’s playing tricks on our abilities to approximate risk. </p>

<p>I’m angry at myself for failing to foresee that the misinformation that we described in our book [<em><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030153458">The Psychiatry of Pandemics</a></em>] in the chapter on immunizations is really not limited to vaccines. It’s more universal … So many people believe that this pandemic is all a hoax. As delusional as [that belief] may be from a psychiatric perspective, we still have to deal with it as a real issue. I wish I had become aware of this phenomenon much sooner.</p>



<p><strong>Maimuna Majumder, </strong>a computational epidemiologist at Boston’s Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical who uses data from search trends, social media and local news to simulate the trajectory of outbreaks: There’s still plenty left to unearth about COVID-19, but I think it’s fair to say that the speed of the research done to date – with the goal of saving lives in mind – has been record-breaking.</p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Prather</strong>, an atmospheric chemist and aerosol scientist at the University of California, San Diego and Scripps Institution of Oceanography who urged the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to say that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">the coronavirus spreads through the air</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>): The pushback over acknowledging that this virus is in the air, is airborne … [from] public health agencies and others. I cannot believe the resistance because all the evidence suggests that it’s there. … If we acknowledge that it’s in the air, we can fix it. There’s so many fixable solutions to the problem. It’s killing me.</p>



<p><strong>Jonna Mazet</strong>, an epidemiologist and founding executive director of the UC Davis One Health Institute, which focuses on the interplay between the health of animals, people and the environment: The politicizing of health and the resulting separation and divisions. That resulted in people making really different and sometimes risky choices for their own health. I did not anticipate that issue.</p>



<p>On the science side … the way scientists are raised in science is to be successful, publish and be noticed. I think people rallied to the greater global good and put that down and worked together across all kinds of boundaries. Geographic, disciplinary, and [across sectors] like academic, government, private sector — so that was a beautiful surprise. We should all hope we can continue it.</p>





<h4>What have you learned that is going to help us navigate the second year of the pandemic?</h4>



<p><strong>Prather:</strong> The most important thing we can do is help the public understand that [coronavirus is] in the air. We need to ventilate, add filtration, wear masks. I just really believe that the public has been easily confused by all the messaging. In Year 2, if we can just get the message out there that it is in the air. It’s more important to clean the air than it is for surfaces.</p>



<p>Just saying “ventilation” and “filtration” as we have been doing isn’t quite enough. We have to provide better metrics for people to use to know that their businesses or whatever are safe for people to be in.</p>



<p><strong>Majumder:</strong> [Having] multiple vaccines work at preventing serious illness is a major win that will help us better navigate the next year.</p>



<p><strong>Gandhi</strong>: Doing clinical trials is not only possible during a pandemic, it’s absolutely necessary. You can’t make any progress on treatment unless you do trials during a pandemic. Otherwise you have no idea what works and what doesn’t work, and that’s what March [2020] was like.</p>



<p>Even though the progress has not been as fast as anyone would have liked, we now have several drugs that we have strong evidence for. [That] only came because of imperative clinical trials. So that was a big lesson that I think we knew from medicine but it was never more forcefully demonstrated than in a pandemic.</p>

</aside>



<p><strong>Huremovic: </strong>It’s very simple. We really need to redefine epidemiology as, at least in part, behavioral science. Of course, we can’t disregard the replication of the virus. But we also need to focus on the human behaviors, attitudes, values and reasoning driving this pandemic. The virus is basically just looking to replicate. We are the ones providing the pathways for the virus to replicate.</p>



<p>COVID-19 is the warning shot. This is not the worst that can happen to us. We can take what we have learned about human behavior and how we think in situations like this so that we can help curb an outbreak next time.</p>



<p><strong>Mazet: </strong>We can come together and address big problems that are not necessarily the one problem du jour. Right now, we obviously all want, need desperately to get this pandemic under control. But if we really look at the drivers for the pandemic, we can see that they are also drivers for things like climate change. And those climate change factors are also accelerating our risk of being exposed to emerging viruses — things like population growth, the way we use land, the way that we travel and impact the Earth.</p>



<p>All of those things put us into a situation where pathogens can spread rapidly. But climate change, for example, changes the distribution of the potential hosts for viruses and brings them to human populations that wouldn’t have been exposed, historically. These things are all [raising our] risk for negative consequences of life on Earth.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/03/11/update-name-change-policy/">Update: Name change policy</a></h4>

<p>arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.</p>
<p>arXiv now offers the following name change options:</p>
<ol>
<li>In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address</li>
<li>In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions</li>
<li>In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed</li>
</ol>
<p>We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.</p>
<p>arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaea-microbes-fold-twist-contort-dna-extreme-ways">Archaea microbes fold, twist and contort their DNA in extreme ways</a></h4>

<p>Single-celled archaea microbes pack their DNA into flexible coils that expand and stretch much like a Slinky does. This kind of molecular gymnastics had never been seen before in other organisms and may represent <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65587">a way for archaea to get easy access to their genetic material</a>, researchers report March 2 in <em>eLife</em>.</p>



<p>Some of the observed structures “really look like you take a Slinky and force it open, like a book,” says Karolin Luger, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You would think that this would really contort the DNA in an awful shape, but it actually flows very naturally.”</p>



<p>Similar to the cassette tapes she grew up listening to, DNA stores information in a very thin and fragile filament of nucleic acids, says Luger. But unlike the tapes, which often tangled and tore, rendering them useless, the genetic material can be read, split into two like a zipper and replicated without tangles and breaks –– all while remaining confined in an incredibly small compartment.</p>



<p>In 2017, Luger and her colleagues discovered that archaea — microbes that resemble bacteria under the microscope but are quite distinct — can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-look-how-archaea-package-their-dna-reveals-theyre-lot-us">spool their DNA around small proteins</a> called histones (<em>SN: 8/10/17</em>). This process is strikingly similar to how plants, animals and fungi bend and fold their own genomes into compact, disk-shaped units known as nucleosomes.</p>





<p>But nobody knew what these structures looked like in archaea, or how the microbes gained access to their spooled DNA. Using computer simulations and electron microscopy experiments on the genetic material of <em>Methanothermus fervidus</em>, a heat-loving archaeal species, the researchers found the Slinky-like shapes opened and closed in a clamshell motion.</p>



<p>“My gut reaction was: ‘Wow! So pretty!’” says Luger. “My second reaction was: ‘Of course! This makes so much sense!’”</p>



<p>Complex organisms such as humans, palm trees or mushrooms depend on a sophisticated machinery to loosen their highly compacted nucleosomes and gain access to specific genes. Archaea microbes might instead simply be contorting their DNA to turn genes on and off –– allowing proteins to “read” the genes when the Slinkies open, and cutting off access when they close.</p>



<p>Luger now wishes to look at other strange archaea that live in extreme environments to confirm whether these bendable DNA Slinkies are “a general phenomenon, or whether other solutions have been invented for this DNA packaging problem.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2020">gender pay gap is narrowing in the UK</a>, it still remains. It’s vital, then, to fully understand what causes it — and so what can be done to ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the same work. Research does show that women are less likely than men to initiate salary negotiations, and also ask for less. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965544">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> reveals that a gender gap in negotiation emerges surprisingly early, becoming apparent among children aged just eight to nine. This implies that efforts to close the gender pay gap should start long before anyone even enters the workforce. </p>



<span id="more-41479"></span>



<p>Sophie Arnold at Boston College and Katherine McAuliffe at New York University studied 240 boys and girls who lived in the Boston area. The children fell into three age groups: 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and 8 to 9. They each completed a simple task, after which an experimenter — either a man or a woman — told them that they could pick from sets of stickers as a reward. Each child was asked: ‘How many stickers do you think you should get for completing the game you just played?’</p>



<p>If the child asked for two or fewer, they were given this number. But if they asked for more than two, the experimenter told them that they were asking for too many and repeated the question. If the child again asked for more than two, they moved to the next negotiation stage. (Of the initial 240 children, 154 — equal numbers boys and girls — reached this stage.)</p>



<p>In this next stage, the kids were told that if they now asked for more stickers than the experimenter could give them, they wouldn’t get any; however, if they asked for the number of stickers that could be handed over, or fewer, they would receive that number. “These rules were introduced to reflect the risk inherent in negotiations, in which the evaluator has all the power to accept or reject an offer,” the researchers write. These children were then asked again how many stickers they thought they should get. If they asked for more than two they were told that only fewer than three stickers could be given. Whatever number they asked for next, the negotiation ended.</p>



<p>Arnold and McAuliffe found that for 8 to 9 year old girls (but not the younger ones), the number of stickers that they initially asked for was lower if the evaluator was male than if the experimenter was female. For the boys, though, neither their age nor the gender of the evaluator affected their initial requests.</p>



<p>The team also looked at how persistent the children were in asking for a relatively high number of stickers. “How long a person continues to ask for a greater bonus could also perpetuate gender differences in outcomes from negotiations,” the researchers note. In fact, they found a similar pattern: the persistence of the older girls (but not the boys) was lower when their evaluator was male. “Our study is the first to show that gender differences in negotiation emerge in childhood,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>So what might explain these early gender differences? It might be that the older girls have acquired the perception that they have a relatively low status, and the male investigator a higher status, the researchers suggest. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/">Stereotypes that boys are naturally more brilliant and competent could also play a role</a>.</p>



<p>“Much attention has been devoted to explaining and closing the gender pay gap, yet these efforts focus almost exclusively on adults,” the researchers note. “Our findings suggest that these efforts should start earlier in development, as early as elementary school.” The next step, of course, is to map out what these efforts should entail, and testing how well they work. However, even if some gender differences in negotiation do help to explain the gender pay gap, other factors are certainly involved, and the onus should be not on employees, but rather employers, to ensure that it closes.  </p>

This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the <em>International Society of Nephrology</em> and the I<em>nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations</em> with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.</p>
<p>Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.</p>
<p>Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.</p></blockquote>
<p>This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.</p>

<p>A lavish Bronze Age burial found in southeastern Spain may hold a queen’s remains, researchers say.</p>



<p>This unexpected discovery bolsters suspicions that women wielded political power in that region’s El Argar society, which lasted from around 4,220 to 3,570 years ago. Researchers have typically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-european-households-combined-rich-poor">assumed that men ran Bronze Age societies</a> (<em>SN: 10/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>In 2014, a team led by archaeologist Vicente Lull of the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered the skeletons of a man and a woman in a large jar underneath what appears to be a royal structure at a site called La Almoloya. Radiocarbon dating indicates that both individuals died about 3,700 years ago.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="La Almoloya site landscape" class="wp-image-3097301" height="406" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031021_bb_bronze-age-woman-ruler_inline2_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097301">Remnants of a Bronze Age palace at Spain’s La Almoloya site held a surprise: the grave of a woman who may have been a queen.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097301">Grup ASOME/UAB</span></figure>



<p>Most of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.8">29 valuables in the grave</a> lay on or next to the woman, Lull’s group reports in the April <em>Antiquity</em>. A semicircular silver headband, or diadem, with a disk that would have rested on the forehead or the bridge of the nose, was found on the woman’s skull. Excavations at other El Argar sites in the 19th and 20th centuries yielded several females buried with diadems. Functions of the buildings under which those graves were located are unknown. But diadems signified power and social prominence, the researchers contend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="silver diadem" class="wp-image-3097300" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031021_bb_bronze-age-woman-ruler_inline1_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097300">A crownlike silver diadem found atop the skull of woman buried at Bronze Age site in Spain contributed to suspicions that she had been a political ruler.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097300">Grup ASOME/UAB</span></figure>



<p>At La Almoloya, the woman and man were buried beneath a room where up to around 50 people could have conducted royal and political business. Other parts of what was likely a palace contained living quarters and spaces for activities such as grinding grain.</p>



<p>If the La Almoloya woman was a queen, the researchers can’t say if she was a ceremonial leader or made actual rulings, either on her own or with a royal council.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-one-year-later-questions-answers">A year ago, we asked 6 questions about COVID-19. Here’s how the answers evolved</a></h4>

<p>One year ago, <em>Science News</em> published the first of our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/special-newsletter">Coronavirus Update</a> newsletters. The goal was to provide readers with a quick glimpse into the latest research and news on the novel coronavirus amidst an ever-rising tide of questions and fears.</p>



<p>We are now revisiting the topics we tackled in that first March 10, 2020 newsletter. What have we learned since? One thing is clear: Even as scientists across the globe have collaborated to find answers, many questions remain.</p>



<p>See what we reported a year ago and how the science has evolved.</p>



<h4>How deadly is the virus?</h4>





<p><strong>March 10, 2020: </strong> “Even as the U.S. State Department <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/cruise-ship-passengers.html">warns people to avoid cruises</a>, the <em>Diamond Princess</em>, the cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan in February, is providing new insight into the virus that causes COVID-19. Only about <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773v2">17 percent of people onboard contracted the virus</a> and many of them were asymptomatic. … Of all infected, 1.2 percent died; of those sick enough to need hospital care, 2.3 percent died.”</p>



<p><strong>Now:</strong> Estimating just how deadly the coronavirus is has been challenging. Simple division — <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">2,612,644 deaths as of this morning</a>, when divided by 117,690,020 confirmed infections — suggests a fatality rate of 2.2 percent. But that doesn’t account for the vast numbers of undetected infections as well as untallied deaths from COVID-19. </p>

<p>Outbreaks like the one on the <em>Diamond Princess</em> presented scientists with a unique opportunity to study the virus in a contained space where everyone can be tested. Taking data from cruises can’t happen now because they’ve been canceled, at least in the United States. A broad look at many studies in December estimated that infections resulted in death on average <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220321809">0.68 percent</a> of the time. But that single number obscures the role that age, quality of health care, social distancing measures and other factors play in influencing risk of death. For example, other estimates show that 0.002 percent of 10-year-olds die after infection, while 1.4 percent of 65-year-olds and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1">27 percent of those 85 and older</a> die.</p>



<p>New virus variants are complicating estimates too. The B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom late last year, for example, may be around <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579">64 percent more deadly</a> than older variants, according to a March 10 study published in <em>BMJ</em>. — <em>Jonathan Lambert</em></p>



<h4>Will this coronavirus become seasonal?</h4>



<p><strong>March 10, 2020</strong>: “Some scientists think that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112v1">may end up coming back every winter</a> like the flu. Simulated virus transmission … found that the seasonal patterns of any future outbreaks depend on when, or if, people’s immunity against the virus wanes. If immunity wanes every year, similar to what happens with the coronaviruses that cause common colds, then we may get annual outbreaks.”</p>



<p><strong>Now: </strong>The chorus of researchers who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2">think SARS-CoV-2 isn’t going away</a> is large, but how often we could face outbreaks after the pandemic ends is up for debate. A recent simulation proposed that SARS-CoV-2 will join the viruses we encounter year-round and will <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/741">primarily cause mild illness in children</a> going forward. Other researchers argue that we need to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777343">prepare for COVID-19 to become a recurrent seasonal disease</a>. It will be difficult to reach herd immunity through vaccination, they say, and increasing spread of variants raises the risk of reinfection. It’s possible people will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 annually or need booster shots that better tackle variants. — <em>Aimee Cunningham</em></p>



<h4>Where does the virus hang out?</h4>



<p><strong>March 10, 2020:</strong> “Scientists examined hospital rooms in Singapore to find out where the virus hangs out. The good news is that … no virus was found in air samples. The bad news is that before cleaning, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762692">the virus was all over a patient’s room</a>. … The coronavirus was also found in the toilet bowl. … That might be evidence that stool is a route of transmission.”</p>

<p><strong>Now:</strong> The good news is that contaminated surfaces don’t seem to be a major source of transmission. Stool is also not how people usually get COVID-19, but monitoring viral RNA in sewage has become a tool for detecting how much virus is circulating in communities. The bad news is that scientists have <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30739-6/fulltext">isolated SARS-CoV-2 particles capable of causing infections from air</a> in a hospital room. That’s one piece of growing amounts of evidence that people mostly catch the coronavirus by inhaling it. — <em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></p>



<h4>How concerned should we be?</h4>



<p><strong>March 10, 2020:</strong> A reader asked, “Why are people in such a tizzy about it? …  With regard to numbers killed, influenza in the U.S. alone far surpasses it. It just seems like the level of concern is disproportionate to the actual threat. Am I missing something?”</p>



<p>We answered: “Scientists are worried that the new coronavirus could take hold in the United States, causing yearly epidemics like the flu… Because it’s new, no one has immunity against the virus… so it can spread rapidly and widely.”</p>



<p><strong>Now:</strong> A year in, it’s abundantly clear that concern was warranted. To date, COVID-19 has killed 2.6 million people globally, with more than half a million deaths in the United States. Even with vaccines available, the threat is not gone. Experts are concerned that another surge in cases may be on the horizon, as more contagious coronavirus variants spread across the country and some states begin to lift mask mandates and other public health restrictions. </p>



<p>Social distancing, mask wearing and other efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus have also sent cases of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">flu and other respiratory diseases plummeting</a>. But those may spike once people get together more frequently. — <em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></p>



<h4>Can the virus be contained?</h4>



<p><strong>March 10, 2020: </strong> We quoted World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying “the threat of a pandemic has become very real. But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled. The bottom line is: We are not at the mercy of this virus.” </p>



<p><strong>Now:</strong> One year later, more than 100 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus and millions have died. Many countries, such as Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, kept coronavirus transmission low by implementing widespread testing, contact tracing and quarantines. </p>



<p>But other countries have not been as successful in containing the virus. COVID-19 cases in the United States, for instance, soared to record highs during the winter. In December and January, U.S. officials logged more than 200,000 new cases per day. They’re still logging at least 40,000 a day now. — <em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></p>



<h4>What will the economic fallout be?</h4>



<p><strong>March 10, 2020:</strong> Our number to know was <strong>1.3 percent.</strong></p>



<p>“That’s how much global gross domestic product is expected to decline as a result of the outbreak, according to a March 6, 2020 <a href="https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/pdf/GPMB_6March2020statement.pdf">report</a> from the WHO’s Global Preparedness Monitoring Board. About $280 billion may be lost globally in the first quarter of 2020, with China sustaining $62 billion of that loss.”</p>



<p><strong>Now: </strong>Economic losses in 2020 were much larger — about $4 trillion in total — according to a January report from the International Monetary Fund’s <a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/01/26/2021-world-economic-outlook-update">world economic outlook update</a>. Contrary to dire predictions, China saw its GDP rise in 2020, one of few countries to do so. The country’s GDP was projected to rise to <a href="http://statisticstimes.com/economy/gdp-indicators-2020.php">$15.2 trillion in 2020</a> from <a href="https://statisticstimes.com/economy/gdp-indicators-2019.php">$14.2 trillion in 2019</a>.  The United States was expected to lose more than $675 billion — more than 3 percent of its GDP.</p>



<p>Prospects are looking up for 2021 thanks to vaccines, therapies and virus containment measures, the IMF says. The global gross domestic product was $83.845 trillion in 2020 and is expected to grow 5.5 percent in 2021 and 4.2 percent in 2022. — <em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></p>

<p>Even teeny objects obey the law of gravity.</p>



<p>A gold ball just 2 millimeters wide, with a mass of about 90 milligrams, is now the smallest object to have its gravitational pull measured. Observations of that gold sphere tugging on another similarly sized sphere confirm that gravity <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03250-7">behaves as expected</a> even for extremely weak gravitational fields, physicists report in the March 11 <em>Nature</em>. Previous experiments have involved objects with masses of hundreds of milligrams or more.</p>



<p>Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Double the distance between two objects and they’ll pull on one another with one-quarter the strength.</p>



<p>A team of physicists based in Vienna tested whether that relationship holds up for tiny masses. The researchers attached a gold sphere to a horizontally suspended beam that was free to rotate in response to the gravitational pull of another gold sphere just a few millimeters away. The experimenters measured the motions of the first sphere while repeatedly moving the second sphere closer and farther away. The results matched predictions of Newton’s law and of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">two theories of gravity</a> that are equivalent under most everyday conditions (<em>SN: 10/4/15</em>).</p>



<p>Ultimately, researchers want to test how gravity behaves on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-gravity-experiment-atoms-general-relativity-einstein">far smaller scales</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/20</em>) — for objects so minuscule that they can perform quantum feats, such as existing in multiple places at once. The gold spheres are too large to follow quantum rules, but the experiment takes scientists a small step closer to exploring gravity’s quantum side.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/bbDdYlM7-W8/">A Farewell to ALM, but not to article-level metrics!</a></h4>

<p>Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS</p>



<p>Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is <a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">defined</a> by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. </p>



<p>PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.</p>



<p>In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.</p>



<p>In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. </p>



<p>One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Altmetric</a>.</p>



<p>Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.</p>



<p>Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. </p>



<p>Beginning today, the data displayed on the “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metrics</a>” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Altmetric’s media coverage</a>. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">details page</a>, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. </p>



<p>As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely. Unfortunately, our articles will no longer display PMC usage counts, as these were aggregated by ALM and will no longer be available. We will also be removing recent tweets from articles and retiring the ALM Reports service.</p>



<p>Moving forward we will continue to evaluate the presentation of metrics on our articles and look for ways to integrate even more relevant data from Altmetric into our user experience.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experimental-toothpaste-peanut-allergy-treatment">An experimental toothpaste aims to treat peanut allergy</a></h4>

<p>Someday it may be possible for people to tackle their food allergies simply by brushing their teeth. A New York City–based company has launched a trial to start testing this concept in a small group of peanut-allergy sufferers. The idea is to expose users to small doses of an allergen daily, in order to build and maintain tolerance to it.</p>



<p>Tying this treatment to a daily routine should help allergy sufferers keep up with regular treatment, say researchers at Intrommune Therapeutics, which developed the toothpaste. The product may also do a better job than existing therapies at delivering the active ingredients in those treatments to immune cells throughout the mouth, they say.</p>



<p>About 32 million Americans have food allergies. One existing treatment, oral immunotherapy, also exposes patients to small amounts of their allergen through daily doses swallowed as food. However, the treatment can trigger allergic reactions, and the hard-earned tolerance often wanes without continued maintenance dosing.</p>



<p>A gentler treatment, known as sublingual immunotherapy — which instead delivers smaller doses through under-the-tongue liquid drops — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oral-drops-could-one-day-protect-people-peanut-allergies">offers decent protection while causing fewer side effects</a> (<em>SN: 9/4/19</em>). And it may be especially effective with allergies that are caught early. The mouth drops produce <a href="https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/ymai/AAAAI_2021_LateBreaking_Abstracts.pdf">even stronger, more durable benefits in toddlers</a> than in older children, researchers reported February 27 at a virtual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.</p>





<p>Still, it can be hard for patients to keep up with this daily therapy. Plus, the immune cells thought to be the best target are actually densest inside the cheeks and elsewhere in the mouth — not just under the tongue.</p>



<p>Several years ago, William Reisacher, an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, was puzzling over these concepts while standing in front of a mirror brushing his teeth. “I saw all the foam in my mouth going into all the areas I wanted it to go,” he says. If food proteins could be delivered as a toothpaste, that would get the treatment to the right cells <em>and</em> embed it in a routine daily habit, he thought.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="toothbrush and container of therapeutic toothpaste" class="wp-image-3097254" height="362" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_el_peanut-allergy-toothpaste_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097254">Intrommune Therapeutics is testing its therapeutic toothpaste (pictured) in a small safety trial of adults with peanut allergies.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097254">Intrommune Therapeutics</span></figure>



<p>“Bill told me this crazy idea he had, and I thought it was genius,” says Michael Nelson, an attorney trained in biology and health care. Nelson cofounded Intrommune to develop the product. The newly launched <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04603300">clinical trial of the toothpaste designed to treat peanut allergy</a> will enroll 32 peanut-allergic adults to test how well they tolerate escalating doses. Future trials may test toothpastes that contain several allergens, Nelson says.</p>



<p>Other allergists support the toothpaste concept, though some worry about dose control and safety. When a patient’s gums are sore and inflamed — for example, after dental work or losing a tooth — allergens may have direct access to the bloodstream, which increases the risk of systemic allergic reactions, says allergist Sakina Bajowala. She offers oral and sublingual immunotherapies for food and environmental allergies at Kaneland Allergy &amp; Asthma Center in North Aurora, Ill. “Safety is something I’m going to be watching closely,” she says. But “if they found something they think they can commercialize and make accessible, and if they can prove it’s safe and effective, then fantastic.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Whether you believe in such a thing as “pure evil” — that there are individuals inherently predisposed to intentionally harming others — can fundamentally change how you see the world. Strong belief in pure evil, for example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/15/things-you-might-want-to-know-about-people-who-believe-in-pure-evil/">has been linked to</a> increased support for the death penalty, torture, and racial prejudice.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3795?af=R?saml_referrer">new study</a>, published in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, has looked at the link between belief in pure evil and the attributes we ascribe to perpetrators of violence. Focusing on mass shootings in the US, the team once again finds a relationship between belief in pure evil and harsher approaches to punishment.</p>



<span id="more-41513"></span>



<p>Participants were randomly assigned to read one of four articles from <em>USA Today</em>, all of which they believed were real, about a mass shooting at a shopping mall. Two of these articles mentioned that the shooter had a brain tumour, and contained a fictitious quote from a neuroscientist explaining how the tumour may have affected the shooter’s behaviour. The other two noted that the perpetrator’s brain scan looked normal.</p>



<p>The articles also differed in how the shooter’s behaviour and traits were described. In the “stereotypically evil” condition, the shooter stated that they had enjoyed the act, while a quote from a security guard described the perpetrator as “smiling, smug… like he got some thrill out of doing it”. In the “non-stereotypically evil” condition the security guard described the shooter as seeming “distressed” by his actions.</p>



<p>After reading the article, participants wrote a small passage explaining why they felt the shooter had perpetrated his crimes. They then rated how confident they were that his actions were caused by his personality, or by environmental factors; that he was in control; that his actions were deliberate; and that he should be blamed or held responsible for his actions. Participants also completed a measure of dehumanisation (responding to statements like “The perpetrator is emotionless”).</p>



<p>They then provided their recommendation for different types of punishment (e.g. community service or the death penalty), and indicated how long they felt the perpetrator should be in prison for, or whether or not they should be executed. Finally, participants completed a scale measuring their belief in pure evil.</p>



<p>People with higher levels of belief in pure evil were far more confident about the reasons for the shooter’s actions, and were more likely to attribute his behaviour to his personality. These participants were also more likely to advocate for harsher punishments, up to and including the death penalty. The analysis also suggested that those who believed in pure evil punished the perpetrator more <em>because</em> they felt he was personally liable, because they had dehumanised him, and because they felt greater levels of retribution.</p>



<p>Overall, participants in the stereotypically evil condition were also more likely to ascribe the act of violence to personality than to environmental factors. Those who read that the shooter had a tumour, on the other hand, advocated for lower levels of punishment and were less likely to blame personal factors. However, people who believed in pure evil tended to support harsh punishment whether or not they read that the perpetrator had a tumour, suggesting that believers in pure evil are generally unmoved by these sorts of considerations.</p>



<p>The team notes that the direction of causality between belief in pure evil and retribution is unclear — that is, we may have developed and bought into the idea of pure evil to justify our inherently retributive instincts rather than the other way around. It would also be interesting to explore narratives about pure evil in the realms of media and politics. Cultural differences could change the relationship between beliefs and punishment: in countries where politicians frequently invoke severe punishments or tend to ignore environmental factors in crime, for example, is there a generally higher level of belief in pure evil than in those areas where this isn’t the case? Future research could probe this further.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-waste-climate-world-united-nations-1-billion-metric-tons-2019">The world wasted nearly 1 billion metric tons of food in 2019</a></h4>

<p>The world wasted about 931 million metric tons of food in 2019 — an average of 121 kilograms per person. That’s about 17 percent of all food that was available to consumers that year, a new United Nations report estimates.</p>



<p>“Throwing away food de facto means throwing away the resources that went into its production,” said Martina Otto, who leads the U.N. Environment Program’s work on cities, during a news conference. “If food waste ends up in landfills, it does not feed people, but it does feed climate change.”</p>



<p>Some 690 million people are impacted by hunger each year, and over 3 billion people can’t afford a healthy diet. Meanwhile, lost and wasted food accounts for 8 to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021">could ease both of those problems</a>, according to the Food Waste Index Report 2021 published March 4 by the U.N. Environment Program and WRAP, an environmental charity based in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Researchers analyzed food waste data from 54 countries. Most waste — 61 percent — came from homes. Food services such as restaurants accounted for 26 percent of global food waste while retail outlets such as supermarkets contributed just 13 percent. Surprisingly, food waste was a substantial problem for nearly all countries regardless of their income level, the team found. “We thought waste was predominantly a problem in rich countries,” Otto said.</p>



<p>While the report is the most comprehensive analysis of global food waste to date, several knowledge gaps remain. The 54 countries account for just 75 percent of the world’s population, and only 23 countries provided waste estimates for their food service or retail sectors. The researchers accounted for these gaps by extrapolating values for the rest of the world from countries that did track these data. The report does not differentiate between potentially edible wasted food and inedible waste such as eggshells or bones.</p>



<p>Otto recommends that countries begin addressing food waste by integrating reduction into their climate strategies and COVID-19 recovery plans. “Food waste has been largely overlooked in national climate strategies,” Otto said. “We know what to do, and we can take action quickly — collectively and individually.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-spain-cave-warm-weather-landscape-art-illustration">Finds in a Spanish cave inspire an artistic take on warm-weather Neandertals</a></h4>

<p>Here’s a scene guaranteed to melt the popular stereotype of Ice Age Neandertals as spear-wielding mammoth hunters confined to Eurasia’s frigid inner core.</p>



<p>New illustrations show what’s currently known about the environment inhabited periodically by Neandertals in Iberia, or what’s now Spain and Portugal, from at least 350,000 years ago to nearly 100,000 years ago. Paleoartist Gabriela Amorós Seller of the University of Murcia in Spain, used colored pencils to illustrate an idyllic view of a Neandertal man and child lounging on flat ground downslope from Bolomor Cave, near the Mediterranean coast of what’s now eastern Spain.</p>



<p>Excavations in the cave have produced evidence of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379121000330">trees, plants and animals shown in the drawing</a>, presented in the March 15 <em>Quaternary Science Reviews</em>. Amorós Seller also illustrated Bolomor Cave’s Neandertal-era entrance and surrounding greenery. She and her colleagues regard these scientifically informed drawings as more than simply appealing to the eye. Art that shows the basic makeup of an ancient environment can inspire scientists to ask new questions. For instance, her group now wants to explore how ancient Iberian plants grew in the wild and what they looked like before being modified over the past few thousand years by farming practices.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="illustration of the entrance to Bolomor Cave in Spain" class="wp-image-3096980" height="1261" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/022521_bb_lanscapes_inline1_tall.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3096980">Eastern Spain’s Bolomor Cave (illustrated) has hosted recent excavations that paint a detailed picture of what life was like for Neandertals who once inhabited that temperate region.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3096980">G. Amorós, <em>Quat. Sci. Reviews</em>, 2021</span></figure></div>



<p>Bolomor Cave Neandertals probably ate fruit, nuts and seeds of plants that once grew in the area, says coauthor José Carrión, an evolutionary biologist and botanist at the University of Murcia. Those plants included hazel shrubs, one of which appears just behind the Neandertal male, who is munching on a hazelnut. Strawberry trees, Mediterranean hackberry, myrtle shrubs, carob trees and chestnut trees — all shown in the drawings — were also available, he says.</p>



<p>Insights about local plant life during Neandertal times come largely from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379119301544">pollen grains and spores found in sediment layers</a> in Bolomor Cave, previously reported by coauthor Juan Ochando, an evolutionary botanist also at the University of Murcia, and colleagues. These layers have also yielded remains of fire pits, burned animal bones, scorched tortoise shells and four Neandertal fossils — a piece of a leg bone, two teeth and part of a braincase.</p>





<p>The animal remains inform other parts of the drawings, such as the Neandertal child watching a tortoise inch its way forward. Tortoises were cooked and eaten at Bolomor Cave, along with frequent prey such as hares, rabbits, birds and deer. People also occasionally consumed large animals such as horses and hippos.</p>





<p>Neandertals most likely responded to relatively mild Iberian temperatures by wearing few or no clothes, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>Whether they were a separate <em>Homo</em> species or an ancient variant of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, Neandertals had a largely unappreciated talent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">for finding and exploiting resource-rich parts of Iberia</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). Amorós Seller’s paintings vividly show some of that mammoth-free bounty.</p>

Investigating the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption can help determine where to target intervention resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption</p></blockquote>
<p>Researchers from the University of Liverpool, Thompson and Pirmohamed, investigated the association between occupation and heavy alcohol consumption in working individuals aged 40-69 years in the UK. Thompson and Pirmohamed used the UK Biobank to recruit participants.</p>
<p>The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption, with jobs identified as skilled trades the most likely to be associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licensed premises, industrial cleaning process occupations, and plasterers. Whereas clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists and medical practitioners were least likely to be heavy drinkers. The authors findings help to determine which employment sectors may benefit most from health promotion programs.</p>

<blockquote><p>This highlights the need for prompt quality improvement</p></blockquote>
<p>Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium (PAD) management are key elements in the care of critically ill patients. However, previous research has highlighted the gap between actual clinical practices and physicians’ attitudes to PAD management. Zhou <em>et al.</em> investigated the current practice of PAD assessments in Chinese ICUs by a one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_12308" style="width: 341px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12308" height="158" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Capture2-300x143.png" width="331" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig. 5 taken from Zhou et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The authors concluded that the actual PAD assessment rate was suboptimal, especially with regards to delirium screening. There was a significant gap between the actual practice and the physicians’ perception of the practice. Physicians reported performing assessing pain and agitation-sedation in approximately only 20 to 25% of patients which is lower than previous reports. Therefore, the study highlights the need for prompt quality improvement and the optimization of practices of PAD management in ICUs in China.</p>

<p>Many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have sleep disturbance and this impacts their quality of life. However, it is not yet fully understood how sleep disturbance affects the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). Kuribayashi <em>et al.</em> carried out a prospective study on 20 patients to investigate the relationship between FD and sleep disturbance. Patients took sleep aids for 4 weeks and filled out questionnaires before and after taking sleep aids.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors found that sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids and as a result, GI symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with FD were also improved. In addition, the authors concluded that the use of sleep-inducing drugs was associated with reduced pain as well as improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in FD patients. Overall the study highlights the potential benefits of sleep aids for patients with FD and sleep disturbance, although multicenter studies involving a larger number of cases are needed to further investigate.</p>

However, the specific muscles that contribute to superior sprint performance for sprinters have not been fully identified. Suga <em>et al. </em>examined the relationships between the trunk and lower limb muscle cross-sectional areas and sprint performance in well-trained male sprinters.</p>
<p>Their findings showed that larger absolute and relative cross-sectional areas of the psoas major and gluteus maximus correlated with better personal best 100m sprint times. Therefore, the psoas major and gluteus maximus may be specific muscles for superior sprint performance for sprinters. The study also corroborates previous studies suggesting that the hamstring may not be an important muscle for achieving superior sprint performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#tab=tab_1">Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women</a> globally and cytology-based (Pap smear) screening is important for early detection and treatment. Although cervical cancer screening is beneficial and can enable early detection, a positive screening result might cause psychological burden. As a result, this may influence the decision to undergo further examination and future screening for cervical cancer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group</p></blockquote>
<p>Isaka <em>et al.</em> carried out a randomized control trial in Japan, with the intervention being the provision of cervical cancer information and cervical cancer screening information through a leaflet. The authors aim was to evaluate whether the leaflet would help reduce psychological distress. Women who were about to undergo cervical cancer screening received hypothetical screening results either with or without a leaflet, at random. Following the intervention, psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group than in the intervention group among those who received a hypothetical positive screening result. Therefore, the authors concluded that information provision might help reduce psychological distress and recommend that cervical cancer screening programs provide participants with all relevant information.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">A year after Australia’s wildfires, extinction threatens hundreds of species</a></h4>

<p>When Isabel Hyman heads out in coming weeks to the wilds of northern New South Wales, she’s worried about what she <em>won’t</em> find. Fifteen years ago, the malacologist — or mollusk scientist — with the Australian Museum made an incredible discovery among the limestone outcrops there: <a href="https://www.qm.qld.gov.au/About+Us/Publications/Memoirs+of+the+Queensland+Museum/MQM+Vol+50/mqmn-50-1-Hyman">a tiny, 3-millimeter-long snail</a>, with a ribbed, dark golden-brown shell, that was new to science.</p>



<p>Subsequently named after her husband, Hugh Palethorpe, Palethorpe’s pinwheel snail (<em>Rophodon palethorpei</em>) “is only known from a single location, at the Kunderang Brook limestone outcrops in Werrikimbe National Park,” she says. Now it may become known for a different, more devastating distinction: It is one of hundreds of species that experts fear have been pushed close to, or right over, the precipice of extinction by the wildfires that blazed across more than 10 million hectares of southeastern Australia in the summer of 2019–2020.</p>



<p>“This location was completely burnt,” says Hyman, who is based in Sydney. “We expect the mortality at this site could be very high and … there is a possibility this species is extinct.”</p>



<p>A year after the last of the fires were doused, their toll on species is becoming increasingly clear.  Flames <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0716-1">devoured more than 20 percent of Australia’s entire forest cover</a>, according to a February 2020 analysis in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. Even if plants and animals survived the flames, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-forest-ecosystem-bounce-back-after-devastating-fires">their habitats may have been so changed</a> that their survival is at risk (<em>SN: 2/11/20</em>). As a result of the scale of the disaster, experts say that more than 500 species of plants and animals may now be endangered — or even completely gone. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="wallaby near a brushfire in New South Wales" class="wp-image-3097197" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_jp_wildfires_inline1_wallaby.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097197">A wallaby licks its burnt paws after escaping a bushfire near Nana Glen in New South Wales on November 12, 2019.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097197">Wolter Peeters/The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Image</span></figure>



<p>Australia’s iconic koala became the poster child of the crisis as images of rescuers carrying these singed marsupials out of the flames went global: As many as 60,000 of the nation’s estimated population of 330,000 koalas perished in the fires, ecologists <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/ArticleDocuments/353/WWF_Impacts-of-the-unprecedented-2019-2020-bushfires-on-Australian-animals.pdf.aspx">concluded in December</a> in a report for World Wildlife Fund Australia. While there’s no doubt that such charismatic megafauna suffered enormously, the greatest toll is likely to have been in other groups of species, such as invertebrates and plants, which often escape the public’s attention.</p>



<p>As Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/australia-fires-have-pushed-as-many-as-100-threatened-species-closer-to-extinction-2020-01-18/">told the Associated Press</a> last year: “I don’t think we’ve seen a single event in Australia that has destroyed so much habitat and pushed so many creatures to the very brink of extinction.”</p>





<h4>Koala charisma</h4>



<p>Even before the fires, many vertebrate species were already on downward trends, says John Woinarski, an ecologist at Charles Darwin University in Darwin. The blazes have “exacerbated the threats that were driving the declines,” he says.</p>



<p>For example, fluffy arboreal marsupials called greater gliders (<em>Petauroides volans</em>) had already experienced a 50 percent population decline in recent decades. The fires then burned a third of their remaining habitat along Australia’s eastern coastline. An ongoing assessment may lead to the gliders being recategorized from vulnerable to endangered.</p>



<p>Overall, 49 vertebrates that previously were not endangered <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1251-1">now qualify for being listed as threatened</a> under Australia’s guidelines for that designation, researchers reported in July in <em>Nature Ecology and Evolution.</em> That shift alone would increase the tally of nationally protected nonmarine vertebrate species by about 15 percent, from 324 to 373.</p>



<p>Another 21 already threatened vertebrates had more than 30 percent of their ranges burned, and some may now qualify for being reassessed to higher categories of threat, the authors found. One species that may need to be recategorized is the koala (<em>Phascolarct</em><em>o</em><em>s cinereas</em>), with some state’s populations that were hardest hit under consideration to be upgraded from vulnerable to endangered. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Paul the koala sits on a blanket" class="wp-image-3097199" height="419" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_jp_wildfires_inline2_koala.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097199">A koala named Paul recovers from his burns at an ICU in November 2019 after being rescued by volunteers following weeks of bushfires across New South Wales and Queensland.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097199">Edwards/Getty Image</span></figure>



<p>Besides the impact on koalas, the WWF Australia report suggests that as many as 3 billion individual mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs died or were displaced during the crisis. Though those figures are astounding, the impacts on lesser-studied groups such as invertebrates and plants may have been even greater.</p>



<p>“Many of those have much smaller ranges [than vertebrates], which means they are going to be even more impacted when a big fire goes through,” says James Watson, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane and an author of the <em>Nature Ecology and Evolution</em> paper on vertebrates. “I am willing to bet that there’s many species … that may disappear forever.”</p>



<h4>Invertebrate impact</h4>



<p>In February, more than 100 biologists convened the first of several online workshops to assess whether 234 Australian invertebrates now need to be added to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List</a> — a global who’s who of threatened species. </p>



<p>Snails, similar to many invertebrates, are particularly susceptible to wildfires, as they are unable to outrun flames and can’t survive intense heat, Hyman notes. Many also have small ranges that were completely incinerated, leaving no survivors that can recolonize the burned area.</p>



<p>“A snail can’t do much to escape,” she says. “You could expect more than 90 percent mortality in a high-intensity bushfire.” In October, Hyman’s team published one of the first papers quantifying the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3853/j.1835-4211.32.2020.1768">impacts on invertebrates</a> in New South Wales in the <em>Technical Reports of the Australian Museum Online</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="pinwheel snail" class="wp-image-3097207" height="354" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_jp_wildfires_inline6_pinwheel-snail.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097207">The Palethorpe’s pinwheel snail (<em>Rophodon palethorpei</em>) has not yet turned up in searches following the wildfires, but other snail species did survive.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097207">Vince Railton, Queensland Museum</span></figure></div>



<p>Their surveys showed that 29 species in the state — including dung beetles, freshwater crayfish, flies, snails and spiders — had their entire ranges burned. Another 46 species had at least half their known habitat within the fire zones. These 75 species were among the 234 under consideration for adding to the IUCN Red List during the biologists’ first online workshop.</p>



<p>“We’ve gathered together 230-odd species that are believed to now be of concern. These include a range of different taxa from land snails to millipedes to arachnids to insects, and this 230 is growing rapidly,” says Jess Marsh, an arachnologist at Charles Darwin University who was one of the conveners of the workshop. “I expect it will massively increase.”</p>



<p>Some of the spiders she studies were the first to be added to that list. She’s already spent several months on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-searching-firegrounds-for-surviving-kangaroo-island-micro-trapdoor-spiders-6-months-on-im-yet-to-find-any-139556">hunting without luck</a> for the Kangaroo Island assassin spider (<em>Zephyrarchaea austini</em>). Dependent on leaf litter suspended in the understory, and restricted to just a few locations that were razed in early 2020, she suspects that the species may be extinct.</p>

Rix and M.S. Harvey/<em>ZooKeys </em>2012</span></figure></div>



<p>“There’s no understory vegetation left, let alone any leaf litter suspended in it, so that species is really hanging in the balance,” says Marsh.</p>



<p>Generally, the species being considered for recognition as endangered had more than 50 percent of their ranges burned, lived in flammable parts of the habitat and have little ability to disperse to other areas. More than 150 of the 234 species being urgently assessed had their entire range burned. And it’s not just the flames themselves that are problematic; so is the reshaped environment following fires. Millipedes, for example, are very vulnerable not only to fire but also to drying out in the reduced shade and shelter of the post-fire environment.</p>



<p>“A lot of invertebrates are very susceptible to desiccation, and need cover and humidity to survive a hot summer, which are obviously lacking following the fire,” Marsh says. “Taking into account all of the threats … we could be looking at significant numbers going extinct.”</p>



<h4>Rooted in place</h4>



<p>Lost vegetation hasn’t just put animals in danger. Many plants themselves may also be at risk, though experts have yet to compile an official list.</p>



<p>Rachael Gallagher, a plant ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, has been <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/bushfire-recovery/priority-plants">prioritizing endemic plant species</a> — those found nowhere else on Earth — that are in most urgent need of conservation for the Australian government. Perhaps surprisingly, she’s particularly worried about some trees that actually depend on fire to survive. Eucalypts known as alpine ash (<em>Eucalyptus delegatensis</em>) and mountain ash (<em>E. regnans</em>), for instance, are typically killed by fire and then regenerate from surviving seeds in the aftermath. Australia has many trees that must <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-forest-ecosystem-bounce-back-after-devastating-fires">complete their entire life cycle</a> from germination through to reproductively mature adult before the next major bushfire passes through (<em>SN: 2/11/20</em>). For some species, this may take 15 to 20 years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="canopy of mountain ash trees" class="wp-image-3097198" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_jp_wildfires_inline4_eucalyptus-regnans.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097198">Some trees in Australia, such as this mountain ash (<em>Eucalyptus regnans</em>), depend on fire for their lifecycle, but recent wildfires may have been too much too soon.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097198">station96/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figure>



<p>The problem now is that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">climate change has increased the frequency of fires</a> to the degree that many of these plants are unable to reach adulthood and set seed before the next fire passes through, meaning they may be lost from these ecosystems (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The fires burned 25–100 percent of the ranges of 257 species of plants for which “the historical intervals between fire events across their range are likely to be too short to allow them to effectively regenerate,” Gallagher says. These species, which have some degree of fire tolerance, are at “increased risk of extinction.” These include shrubs and trees such as the granite boronia (<em>Boronia granitica</em>), Forrester’s bottlebrush (<em>Callistemon forresterae</em>), dwarf cypress pine (<em>Callitris oblonga</em>) and the Wolgan snow gum (<em>Eucalyptus gregsoniana</em>).</p>



<h4>Found, not lost</h4>



<p>Nevertheless, as researchers head out into the field to assess what’s lost, what they are sometimes finding are glimmers of hope. “Australian plants are remarkably resilient and there’s been regeneration in places where nobody thought there would be,” Gallagher says.</p>



<p>One species that survived against all the odds is the Gibraltar Range waratah (<em>Telopea aspera</em>), a drought-resistant shrub with leathery leaves and bright red flowers. “This species has a very small range, being specialized to granite outcrops in one mountain range, which was burnt during the fires,” she says. “However, it has been noted as resprouting after the fires by park rangers and, in the absence of another fire in coming years, is likely to be able to recover.”</p>



<p>Several animal species that were thought to be in grave peril following the fires <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster">that burned nearly half of the 4,400-square-kilometer Kangaroo Island</a> have survived better than expected too (<em>SN: 1/13/20</em>). In the particularly badly burned reserves of the western end of the island, tiny marsupial carnivores called Kangaroo Island dunnarts (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni</em>) are frequently appearing on camera traps. Swiftly erected predator-exclusion fences now protect survivors from feral cats.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a Kangaroo Island dunnart" class="wp-image-3097196" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_jp_wildfires_inline5_dunart.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097196">Tiny marsupials known as Kangaroo Island dunnarts (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni</em>) have fared much better than other animals, appearing frequently on camera traps.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3097196">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</span></figure>



<p>Similarly, large flocks of the glossy black-cockatoo (<em>Calyptorhynchus lathami</em>) have adapted by moving to unburned areas with food trees, says Karleah Berris of Natural Resources Kangaroo Island, who heads the crew that manages the endangered birds. Better news yet, a surprising number of birds bred and fledged young in mid-2020. “The important thing now is to protect what is left from fire until the burnt areas regenerate,” she says. “But I think, at present, all signs are that they are coping.”</p>



<p>Hyman says that, hearteningly, her team found handfuls of survivors of some snail species during several surveys in New South Wales in late 2020. The snails turned up in small patches of unburned habitat, sometimes at the bottom of gullies or in deep leaf litter around the bases of large trees. And that gives her hope that other snail species may have held on in other, larger unburned patches with greater numbers of survivors.</p>



<p>“But the question then becomes, what sort of recovery can they make from that?” she says. “Whether they can recover and breed up and start to move back into surviving areas again perhaps depends on how dry the weather is in coming years and if there are more fires.”</p>



<p>She’s still hoping that a handful of Palethorpe’s pinwheel snails may have clung on against all the odds. “My husband is on tenterhooks wondering if his snail is still there or not,” she says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>When you’ve done something wrong, big or small, it can be hard to own up to it — particularly if you feel you’ve transgressed a moral or social code. Instead, you might avoid confronting the issue and become defensive. Yet defensiveness often has negative consequences anyway: it can hurt someone else’s feelings, cloud your ability to make a good decision in the moment, or prevent you from changing harmful behaviours.</p>



<p>But <em>why</em> do we get defensive, and what can we do to minimise those negative consequences? A <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12378">new study</a> from Michael Wenzel and colleagues at Flinders University, published in the <em>British Journal of Social Psychology, </em>asks both of these questions — and finds that defensiveness could be reduced by affirming people’s moral and social worth.</p>



<span id="more-41474"></span>



<p>In the first study, 187 participants were asked to recall an incident in which they had wronged somebody else, writing a brief description of what they had done. They then rated how severe the transgression was, the importance of their relationship with the person they had wronged, how guilty they felt and how much they accepted blame (e.g. “I wasn’t the one to blame for what happened”), and how loved and accepted they felt despite any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Participants then took part in an implicit guilt test, a version of the (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">controversial</a>) Implicit Association Test. This essentially looked at how quick participants were to categorise self-related words (e.g. “me”) when they also had to press the same key to categorise guilt-related words (e.g. “blame”) versus when they had to press the same key to categorise innocence-related words (e.g. “virtue”). If they were faster for the former, this was taken as an implicit association of the self with guilt.</p>



<p>The results suggested that those participants who felt a higher need for belonging were more likely to engage in defensiveness: the more “implicit” guilt they showed on the test, the less likely they were to assert that they were to blame for the incident they outlined. Those who felt socially accepted, on the other hand, were more likely to express explicit guilt as their level of implicit guilt increased.</p>



<p>In the second study, omnivorous participants were shown a short video about cruelty within the egg and meat industry before speaking to a bot, which either affirmed or denigrated their choice to eat meat.</p>



<p>Watching the video on animal cruelty led to greater guilt and concerns about moral or social transgression — but only when there was no opportunity to have that guilt assuaged through the online chat. Those participants who <em>had</em> received reassurance from the bot about eating meat were also more likely to explicitly express guilt that reflected their levels of implicit guilt. Those who had not received reassurance saw a greater disconnect between implicit and explicit guilt, suggesting a level of defensiveness.</p>



<p>Participants who had received reassurance from the bot were also more likely to donate to an animal rights organisation, while those who had not were less likely to donate the more implicit guilt they indicated. This, the team says, suggests that threats to acceptance can lead not only to increased defensiveness but also an unwillingness to repair harm.</p>



<p>As noted, the Implicit Association Test has faced serious scrutiny over the last few years, with some critics suggesting that the test may not be truly indicative of real-life thoughts or behaviours. The team also acknowledges that the relationship between implicit and explicit guilt may not be as straightforward as the results suggest — defensiveness may be so effective a psychological process, they write, that it may reduce or even eliminate implicit evaluations or admissions of responsibility and guilt. In other words, defensiveness may not only be an external avoidance of blame but an internal one, which individuals are not aware of themselves. External admissions of guilt may also be unreflective of true or implicit feelings of guilt — someone might profusely apologise for reasons that are more to do with social pressure than real feeling.</p>



<p>Still, the results suggest a key element of defensiveness is a feeling of moral or social threat. Where individuals are given affirmation, defensiveness decreases — and more efforts are made to repair harm. It may be difficult to give someone such reassurance, particularly when you’re the one they’ve harmed — but it could also be the best way of helping them truly engage with what they’ve done.</p>

<p>As the pace of coronavirus vaccinations picks up, normal life is looking tantalizingly in reach. Nearly a year after the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-who-pandemic">declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 3/11/20</em>), and social distancing efforts sent billions of people into isolation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is outlining some of the social perks to getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>Vaccinated friends can have dinner together in their homes without wearing masks or physical distancing, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said March 8 during a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?509660-1/white-house-covid-19-response-team-briefing&amp;vod">White House coronavirus briefing</a>. “You can visit your grandparents if you have been vaccinated and they have been, too.”</p>



<p>But vaccinated people still need to take precautions around the unvaccinated, especially those at high risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19, and group settings are still considered risky.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>These guidelines are a first step toward letting people know what aspects of normal life can resume, Walensky said, but could change as new data become available. For instance, the guidelines could become more permissive as vaccination becomes more widespread and cases continue to fall. But if new coronavirus variants that can reinfect even people who have previously had COVID-19 take hold, restrictions might be reimposed.</p>



<p>The news comes as about 2 million coronavirus vaccine shots are being delivered into people’s arms in the United States each day. As of March 8, 59 million adults in the United States have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of those, 31 million people — 9.2 percent of the U.S. population — are fully vaccinated. That means it’s been at least two weeks since they’ve gotten both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or the single shot of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. </p>



<p>Those numbers are “putting us on a strong path to eventually ending this pandemic,” Walensky said.</p>



<p>While results from clinical trials have indicated that all of the vaccines protect against severe illness and death, there is still a small risk that vaccinated people might get mild or asymptomatic infections, which they might pass on to unvaccinated people, she said. Some data indicate that the Pfizer vaccine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">lowers the risk of infection</a> and may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pfizer-vaccine-may-reduce-transmission">reduce the risk of transmitting the virus</a> to others (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>; <em>SN: 2/12/21</em>), but definitive studies have yet to be completed. Other vaccines may also lower the risk of catching and passing along the virus, but there is less known about those shots.</p>

<p>Still, “as more Americans get vaccinated, a growing body of evidence tells us that there are some activities that fully vaccinated people can resume at low risk to themselves,”  Walensky said.</p>



<p>Fully vaccinated people can start visiting also vaccinated friends and family two weeks after their last jab. For these vaccinated groups, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">indoor gatherings sans masks or social distancing are OK</a>, according to the new guidelines. Plus, those individuals don’t need to quarantine if exposed to the coronavirus, as long as they don’t have any COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>It gets trickier when unvaccinated people are thrown into the mix, particularly those at high risk of severe illness or death — including those 65 and older and people with health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer that make them more vulnerable to complications, Walensky said. Socializing with unvaccinated high-risk individuals and their family members still isn’t recommended.</p>



<p>But meet-ups among vaccinated people and people from one household who are unvaccinated but at low risk for becoming severely ill if infected with the coronavirus are fine. </p>





<p>Vaccinated people should still avoid larger gatherings, including mask-less get-togethers with more than one unvaccinated household. Vaccinated individuals also shouldn’t meet with someone who is unvaccinated and at high risk for severe COVID-19, or with a high-risk person’s family members. In these scenarios, everyone should still wear a mask and keep their distance. </p>



<p>And while out in public, vaccinated people should still continue to wear <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting face masks</a> and keep their distance from others (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). That helps further reduce the coronavirus’s spread and protect others who haven’t gotten shots yet. The CDC also still recommends putting off travel and staying home for now.     </p>

<p>Losing your body from the neck down can be just another one of life’s annoying, but temporary, setbacks — at least for two kinds of rippling, green-tinged sea slugs.</p>



<p>Heads of young <em>Elysia</em> cf. <em>marginata</em> sea slugs can pull themselves free from their bodies and just keep crawling around while growing a new body, report ecologists at Nara Women’s University in Japan. Within a few hours, some separated heads start nibbling on algae again, Sayaka Mitoh and Yoichi Yusa report March 8 in <em>Current Biology</em>. And within about 20 days, a third of the young sea slugs they watched had grown their bodies back, heart and all.</p>



<p>That’s the first time anyone has reported such dramatic “whole-body” regeneration in any sea slug “as far as we know,” Yusa says.</p>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="sea slug body regeneration on day 0, day 7, day 14 and day 22" class="wp-image-3097188" height="290" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/030521_sm_sea-slug_inline_desktop_680.png" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3097188">After disconnecting its head from its body (far left, arrow points to the heart), a process that can take several hours, an <em>Elysia</em> cf. <em>marginata</em> sea slug gradually grows a whole new body.

Yusa/<em>Current Biology</em> 2021</span></figure></div>



<p>Other creatures can regenerate, too. In one sense, planarians, the little cross-eyed flatworms that biology students mince up to study regeneration, “are better,” Yusa says. They can regenerate the whole body from multiple cut pieces. Yet their body plan is simpler, and they don’t have hearts.</p>



<p>A group of tubelike sea squirts called ascidians might be considered the most complex of whole-body regenerators. Yet ascidians also lack a heart. And vertebrate regenerators, like salamanders regrowing a tail left in the jaws of a predator, don’t regrow a whole body from a severed head.</p>





<p>Mitoh first noticed the sea slugs’ extreme regeneration by chance in some <em>Elysia</em> slugs in the lab. “We were really surprised to see the head crawling,” Yusa says.</p>



<p>Just which <em>Elysia</em> species can turn into crawling heads isn’t clear yet. Marine biologist Sónia Cruz at the University of Aveiro in Portugal works with two other <em>Elysia</em> species but hasn’t seen anything like it. She does caution, though, that she hasn’t done systematic tests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>After noticing some Elysia sea slugs shedding their bodies and regrowing new ones, researchers documented this extreme regeneration. A tiny leash tied around a natural groove in the neck of a sea slug prompts the slug to escape by discarding most of its body, including such major organs as its heart. That headless body remains alive for a while, but eventually dies. The head, however, crawls around on its own and by a week later has visibly started to grow its body back. In 17 days, this sea slug’s regeneration is complete.</figure>



<p>The head of a sea slug can take several hours to rip itself loose from its body, so Mitoh and Yusa doubt that de-heading helps when predators attack. Instead, a detachable body could give the sea slug a drastic, but effective, way of dealing with parasites. In a batch of wild-caught <em>E. atroviridis </em>sea slugs, the few that ditched their bodies were parasitized by copepods. So were those that just lost pieces of their body, some of which also regrew.</p>



<p>On close inspection, the researchers found that sea slugs have a slight groove looped on the back of the head region that seems to work as a break-here zone. The bodies left behind can still move on their own for days or even months. An abandoned body, however, doesn’t regrow its head. The leaf-shaped remnant instead turns pale and weak and eventually dies.</p>





<p>What might help <em>Elysia </em>slugs manage such extreme regrowth is their ability to steal the tiny green sunlight-trapping energy factories called chloroplasts from plants, the researchers muse. Very young slugs don’t have any chloroplasts. “They need to pierce the cell walls of sea algae and sip the contents,” Yusa says. The grazing slugs can keep the chloroplasts alive for weeks or months.</p>



<p>Biologists debate what the stolen chloroplasts do for their kidnappers besides provide a pretty, green tinge. Yusa, however, has linked the looted chloroplasts to such consequential matters as improved reproduction. If chloroplasts are more than cosmetic, maybe that energy boost is just what a severed head needs to get (more than) ahead.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324001683">Beloved Beasts</a><br /><em>Michelle Nijhuis</em><br /><em>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $27.95</em></p>



<p>On October 29, 1929, a date best remembered for the infamous Black Tuesday stock market crash, socialite and amateur bird watcher Rosalie Edge attended a meeting of the National Association of Audubon Societies. She was there to ask whether it was true, as a pamphlet had claimed, that the organization supported bounties on bald eagles in Alaska and turning wildlife refuges into shooting grounds.</p>



<p>The men who led the organization were outraged that she brought up the issue. But the pamphlet revealed a truth about conservation at the time: The movement was not as much about saving species as it was about saving only certain species that people liked. And sometimes people only liked those species because they liked to kill them.</p>





<p>The idea of conservation has evolved a lot over the last two centuries, as Michelle Nijhuis documents in her new book, <em>Beloved Beasts: Fighting for Life in an Age of Extinction</em>. It was only in the mid-1700s that Carl Linnaeus began formalizing the idea of species. The recognition that a species could actually go extinct followed soon after. The push to prevent extinctions from happening came in the 1800s, with the realization that species such as the dodo had disappeared forever. Now we know that humans are driving such losses at a rate not seen for millions of years.</p>





<p>Edge is just one of the many people who Nijhuis highlights in her excellent history. She includes famous names, such as Aldo Leopold, who in the early 20th century shaped the field of wildlife biology and whose writings have influenced generations, and Rachel Carson, whose 1962 book <em>Silent Spring</em> inspired huge changes to U.S. environmental laws and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. But it’s Nijhuis’ tales of lesser-known people, such as Edge and Michael Soulé, who is considered the father of conservation biology, that prove most fascinating. Their stories show how a single person can spark big changes, creating organizations and efforts that last for decades and grow to span the globe.</p>



<p>The book truly shines, though, when Nijhuis is brutally honest about how the conservation movement gained a reputation for being antihuman. Prominent conservationists in the 19th and 20th centuries at times endorsed abhorrent practices, such as eugenics. But more often and more subtly, the movement has advocated for actions such as removing Indigenous communities from areas set aside for wildlife.</p>



<p>Nijhuis also recognizes the need to move beyond worrying about saving eagles or any other single species. We must save whole ecosystems, all while balancing human needs, she writes.</p>



<p>One example of such a holistic approach comes from Namibia, home to iconic animals like rhinos and giraffes, where conservation is not a top-down effort guided by governments or organizations with offices on the other side of the planet. It’s carried out by dozens of local conservancies that consider the needs of both their local animals and their local people. Through detailed scrutiny, Nijhuis shows that Namibia’s model is proving successful.</p>



<p>Past methods of saving species, such as focusing solely on charismatic animals, won’t halt what is now recognized by many as Earth’s sixth mass extinction. But the book’s focus on paths forward provides a bit of hope. That hope springs from collective action: We all must step up to save our planet’s beloved beasts. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-plasma-ultra-cold-magnetic-field-trap">A magnetic trap captures elusive ultracold plasma</a></h4>

<p>In terms of difficulty, trapping a plasma is right up there with catching a cloud and pinning it down, or holding a moonbeam in your hand. But physicists have devised a new way to magnetically bottle an ultracold plasma in the lab.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.085002">magnetism to trap frigid plasmas</a>, in which particles move around sluggishly, could allow physicists to study plasma behavior in slow motion, researchers report in the Feb. 26 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That may reveal new details about how plasmas behave in much hotter, more frenetic environments — such as the roiling interiors of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">fusion reactors</a> or stars (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>).</p>



<p>“It takes a lot of tricks” to stopper a cold plasma, says physicist Thomas Killian of Rice University in Houston. He and colleagues first boiled a lump of strontium metal and channeled that vapor down a tube. There, light from a laser beam slowed the atoms almost to a standstill — effectively cooling them to just three-thousandths of a degree above absolute zero (–273° Celsius). Using a second laser, the researchers knocked an electron off each atom, creating a plasma of negatively charged electrons and positive strontium ions.</p>



<p>This ionized gas couldn’t be stashed inside an ordinary container. “We have to completely isolate this plasma,” Killian says. “If it bumps into a wall, [the particles] will just stick to the wall … or the wall will heat it up,” because even room-temperature equipment is much warmer than the plasma. Left out in the open, the plasma would dissipate within tens of microseconds. So Killian’s team created their plasma between two coils of electric current, which formed opposing magnetic fields. These equal and opposite magnetic forces on the charged particles held the plasma together for up to 500 microseconds.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite many efforts to make workplaces more equitable, women are still frequently discriminated against at work. Companies run by women are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/">judged more harshly</a> on ethical failings, for instance, and women are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/">more likely to be lied to</a> in performance reviews. This discrimination doesn’t just happen <em>in</em> the workplace: it can happen before someone is even employed. A study from last year, for example, found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/03/black-women-with-natural-hair-face-biases-from-potential-employers/">Black women with natural hair are seen as less competent and professional than their White counterparts</a> when interviewing for jobs.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01033-0">new study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, has taken a look at what could be scuppering women’s chances even before they get to the interview stage. The team, led by Brian J Lucas from Cornell University, argues that in organisations where recruitment takes place on an informal basis, via colleague recommendations or other word-of-mouth networks, changes need to be made to the shortlisting process. When shortlists are longer, the results suggest, women are more likely to be seriously considered.</p>



<span id="more-41468"></span>



<p>The first few studies looked at how longer shortlists might impact gender representation. Participants imagined being a filmmaker, and were asked to draw up a shortlist of actors to appear in their upcoming action film. In the first stage, participants gave just three suggestions, before being instructed to give three more — the hypothesis being that more women would be listed during the second stage than the first. The results showed that the number of women actors was indeed significantly higher in this second part of the list.</p>



<p>In the second series of studies, participants working in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry were asked to imagine themselves as a corporate strategist, scoping the market for a new CEO. They were again asked at the first stage to suggest three candidates and at the second stage to suggest three more. Results reflected those of the first study: there were significantly more women candidates listed at the second stage compared to the first.</p>



<p>In a third study, parents were asked again for a short and long list, this time naming role models for their male or female child. For parents of boys, results were similar to the prior studies: they named more women role models at the second stage than the first. But the opposite was true of parents of girls. This suggests that in longer lists, people are more likely to include candidates who don’t meet the gender prototype for the role. In certain industries, the prototypical hire is highly likely to be male, explaining why longer candidate lists tend to contain more women.</p>



<p>In the final two studies, participants completed the film director shortlist task from the first study or the technology executive shortlist task from the second — only this time, they were randomly assigned to generate either a three-person shortlist or a six-person shortlist, ranking candidates in order of preference. Again, longer shortlists had a positive effect when it came to inclusion: six-person shortlists featured significantly more women candidates than three-person shortlists. And importantly, six-person shortlists also had a higher <em>proportion </em>of female candidates.</p>



<p>The longer shortlist was also good news for women in terms of actual selection — that is, how highly women candidates were ranked by participants. Participants in the six-person condition were more likely to select women as top candidates than those in the three-person condition, suggesting that longer shortlists can have an impact not only on who gets a tentative foot in the door but who actually ends up with the job.</p>



<p>This type of gender bias is probably not always intentional: many of those informally suggesting candidates for roles will not be purposefully excluding women. Nevertheless, ensuring a move away from informal hiring practices and towards thoughtful, structured ones — blind CV selection, for example, or longer shortlists — could be a way of equalising unbalanced workforces.</p>



<p>As the study on Black women’s hair tells us, however, other factors like race, class and sexuality are likely to play a part in how people are perceived in interviews and in the workplace. Transgender or non-binary people are also likely to face different challenges. How would such candidates fare when it comes to shortlisting? Further research could explore this more.</p>

<h4>A smash hit</h4>



<p><em>In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">A complete collection of cosmic smashups</a>” (</em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 30<em>), <strong>Emily Conover</strong> and <strong>Nadieh Bremer</strong> visualized every gravitational wave event spotted so far.</em></p>



<p>Freelance data visualization designer Nadieh Bremer “reduced an excruciatingly complex subject, gravitational waves produced by cosmic collisions, into a very interesting graphic. Emily Conover made it understandable,” reader <strong>Richard Polangin</strong> wrote. “Bravo to your very gifted staff!”</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Dave</strong> <strong>Proffitt </strong>noticed the colliding black holes were quite massive. “Why no detections in the [mass] range of commonly known black holes?”</p>





<p>It’s easier for the LIGO and Virgo observatories to spot more massive mergers because the gravitational waves are larger. “So, it’s true that there are a lot of detected events that were quite massive. However, there are a handful of detected events that involve quite small black holes,” <strong>Conover</strong> says. One detection, represented in the illustration by the small circle at about 1.6 billion years, resulted from the merger of a black hole with about 8.8 solar masses and a black hole with about five solar masses. “Three solar masses is the lower limit for what can be confidently called a black hole,” she says. “You can’t get smaller than that without it being difficult to d­etermine whether it’s a black hole or a neutron star.”</p>



<h4>Left out</h4>



<p><em>Scientists are getting inventive with ways to touch down on Earth’s neighbors, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-europa-landing-terrain-future-spacecraft" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How to safely land on Venus or Europa</a>” (</em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Michael Stebel</strong> was disappointed that the story did not mention the Huygens probe, which landed on Saturn’s moon Titan in 2005. “Although [the probe] sent back data and images for less than six hours, it was an incredible achievement … especially notable when one considers the distance involved, the extreme cold and the thick hazy atmosphere of Titan,” he wrote.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-medicine-is-fraught-with-ethical-challenges">Genetic medicine is fraught with ethical challenges</a></h4>

<p>Twenty years ago, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">unveiled the first map of humankind’s genetic instructions</a>, an astonishing feat of technology that promised a future of medical treatments tailored to the quirks of a person’s DNA.</p>



<p>Since then, researchers have vastly increased our knowledge of how genes work and realized that there’s still a lot we don’t know about life’s blueprints. And though many drugs designed to target specific human genes or proteins have been approved, for most people the promise of precision medicine is still no more than that — a promise.</p>



<p>One reason is that the human reference genome and other genetic catalogs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">don’t reflect the diversity of humankind</a> — most of the DNA is from people of European heritage. In many cases, that’s not a factor, but with some medical treatments, the differences can be crucial, as senior writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tina-hesman-saey" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tina Hesman Saey</a> reports in this issue. Suggested approaches to make up for those shortcomings are fraught with ethical challenges.</p>



<p>As part of our project exploring the ethics of cutting-edge scientific research, Saey sought out researchers trying to find solutions to the problem of genetic databases dominated by samples from white people. One of those researchers is Constance Hilliard, an evolutionary historian at the University of North Texas in Denton, who points out that many scientists tend to assume that everyone on a continent is the same, and thus may miss how humans adapted to local conditions.</p>





<p>A key goal of this reporting project, which is funded by the Kavli Foundation, is to let the public be a part of the conversation, including using readers’ comments to inform the questions that our reporters ask scientists. So back in November, we posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqGD2ENaiIA">a short video of Hilliard explaining her views</a> and asked people what they thought about her proposal to diversify genetic databases.</p>



<p>Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genetic research is important for advancing medical care, but many also expressed worry that emphasizing genetic differences could lead to more discrimination. There’s a long, tragic history of such efforts, and they continue today. As one reader commented: “The fear is that any differences that are found would be exploited by those who want to denigrate others.”</p>



<p>It’s crucial to bring up these ethical questions and think deeply about them before science happens, Saey told me. “What’s the best way to proceed — not just the best scientific way to proceed, but the most ethical and fair way to go forward?” she asked. “Or maybe decide it’s not ethical and fair to go forward, and then we decide what to do with that.” We’d like you to continue to be part of this conversation. Please <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">read Saey’s story</a> and e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@sciencenews.org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">feedback@sciencenews.org</a>. We’ll report back on what we hear from readers and hope to continue these conversations. Modern science is a powerful force for good. But even unintentional harms can have seismic impacts, especially in an era when science is doubted and even demonized by some.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You can’t bullshit a bullshitter. Well, that’s the saying — but is it true? Shane Littrell and colleagues at the University of Waterloo, Canada, set out to investigate. And in a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjso.12447?campaign=wolearlyview">new paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Social Psychology</em> they report that, in fact, people who bullshit more often in a bid to impress or persuade others are also more susceptible to bullshit themselves. The reason for this — also uncovered by the team — is truly fascinating.</p>



<span id="more-41506"></span>



<p>Some earlier work has suggested that better liars are also better at detecting lies. But as the team notes, bullshit isn’t quite the same, as it falls just short of outright deception. Recently, researchers have begun to treat bullshitting as having two separate dimensions. “Persuasive bullshitting” is motivated by a desire to impress or persuade. “Evasive bullshitting” is different — as a “strategic circumnavigation of the truth”, it’s the sort that a politician might engage in when trying to cover up a mistake, for example. By definition, the creation of either type of bullshit is intentional, though of course the spreading of bullshit may not be. </p>



<p>In an initial study, 219 adults recruited online completed the <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjso.12379">Bullshitting Frequency Scale</a>. (This assesses, for example, how likely you think you are to persuasively bullshit a contribution to a discussion on a topic that you don’t know much about, or to evasively bullshit “when being fully honest would be harmful or embarrassing to me or someone else.”) These participants also completed the Bullshit Receptivity Scale, using a 5-point scale to rate the level of profundity of 10 made up but grammatically correct sentences, all of which had been constructed from pseudo-profound buzzwords. (If “We are in the midst of a high-frequency blossoming of interconnectedness that will give us access to the quantum soup itself” sounds extremely profound to you, you’d probably score highly on this scale…).</p>



<p>The participants also completed scales that assessed their receptivity to “scientific bullshit” (e.g. feeling that a randomly generated sentence that used a lot of terms like “entropy”, “constructive interference” and “quantum ground states” is probably genuine) and also to fake news. For this, the participants were presented with five factually accurate and five fake news items. The latter were taken from a list of genuine popular recent fake news items. The participants had to indicate how accurate they believed each headline to be. </p>



<p>The team found that people who reported engaging in more persuasive bullshitting were more receptive to all forms of bullshit (pseudo-profound, pseudo-scientific and fake news). However, higher scores for evasive bullshitting were not related to susceptibility to the first two forms of bullshit, and were actually associated with <em>less </em>susceptibility to believing fake news.</p>



<p>In a subsequent study, the team found that, when levels of evasive bullshitting were controlled for, people who engaged in more persuasive bullshitting were not only more receptive to pseudo-profound bullshit but were also more over-confident in their own intellectual ability. They also scored lower for cognitive ability (measured using simple numeracy and vocabulary tests) and reported less insight into their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. In contrast, when persuasive bullshitting was controlled for, high evasive bullshitters scored higher on the tests of cognitive ability. As the researchers write, “persuasive bullshitting may rely on less engagement in analytic thinking processes compared to evasive bullshitting”.</p>



<p>The team wondered if persuasive bullshitters might have difficulty telling apart statements that actually are profound from those that only sound profound. So they asked a new group of 400 participants to rate the profundity of various sentences (sentences in the genuinely profound list included, “A river cuts through a rock not because of its power but its persistence”, for example). The results were clear: while those who scored highly for evasive bullshitting were also better at distinguishing between the genuinely profound and the pseudo-profound statements, the high persuasive bullshitters were poor at this. “Put another way, high persuasive bullshitters appear to interpret/mistake <em>superficial profoundness</em> as a signal of <em>actual profoundness</em>,” the team explains.</p>



<p>Overall, the results of the three studies are consistent: “one <em>can</em> ‘bullshit a bullshitter’.” And as the frequent persuasive bullshitters were also more over-confident in their intellectual abilities, they could be seen as experiencing their own <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056">Dunning-Kruger</a> type effect, and suffer from a “bullshit blindspot”, the researchers add. (It’s worth noting that they didn’t explore how good these participants actually were at bullshitting — just because they did it more often doesn’t mean they’re better at it.)</p>



<p>Understanding what makes some people more likely to believe misleading information — and right now, there’s a lot of that around COVID-19 vaccines, of course — is crucial. This work does suggest that the people who like to bullshit themselves are more likely to fall for it, too. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></h4>

<p>Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?</p><p>Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.</p><p>Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene <em>UBE3A</em>, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?</p><p>The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are <em>covertly conscious</em>—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.</p><p>Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true">dreamless sleep</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;tag=1">anesthesia</a>. Interestingly, it is also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421">increased by psychedelic drugs</a> that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?</p><p>My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1">to test this hypothesis</a> using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.</p><p>As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.</p><p>But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.</p><p>The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.</p><p>Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.</p><p>The above technique, called the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf">perturbational complexity index</a> or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645656224/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645656224/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645656224/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/" rel="nofollow">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-may-permanently-change-our-childrens-world/" rel="nofollow">How the COVID-19 pandemic may permanently change our children’s world</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/turning-geology-into-archaeology-how-two-businessmen-changed-the-face-of-time/" rel="nofollow">Turning geology into archaeology: how two businessmen changed the face of time</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p>Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> (<span class="caps">GPU</span>-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
<a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> was originally developed as a pure C++ and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/"><span class="caps">CUDA</span></a> library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a> [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].</p>
<p>In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for <span class="caps">GPU</span> dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Social justice movements, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, have done huge amounts to address racism and sexism in our society. It’s now common for organisations to have diversity programmes, for example. As Ashley Martin at Stanford University and Michael S North at New York University note in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-08078-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, Facebook has famously invested millions of dollars in increasing diversity. However — and this is a big <em>however</em> — the pair’s work reveals that people who are keenest to advocate for women and racial minorities harbour more prejudice against a group that reports <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statistics/charge-statistics-charges-filed-eeoc-fy-1997-through-fy-2019">almost as much US workplace discrimination</a> as these two: older people. </p>



<span id="more-41461"></span>



<p>As the researchers note, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has said that “younger people are just smarter” while Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, which has won awards for diversity and inclusion, has opined that “people over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas”. They are not alone in this attitude — broader society (or at least US and UK society, as a generalisation) finds ageism acceptable, too. “Ageism is so condoned in American culture that many do not see it as an ‘-ism’, in the same manner of other forms of prejudice,” the researchers note.  And yet, older people as a group are disadvantaged, and have more limited opportunities.</p>



<p>To explore ageism and how it might interact with views on sexism and racism, the researchers ran a series of seven studies. A critical measure in each was a participant’s level of “egalitarian advocacy” — their belief in and commitment to creating a more egalitarian world. This was assessed using a scale that the researchers had developed, which gauged participants’ agreement with statements like “I feel angry when I think about the injustices and inequality in society”.</p>



<p>In initial online studies, the team found that people who scored higher on this scale were more disapproving of racism and sexism but also more likely to endorse “Succession-based ageism” — the idea that older people should step aside to improve younger people’s job opportunities.</p>



<p>In a later study, 298 participants were given a theoretical scenario in which a company had a million-dollar fund for improving diversity, to split between a number of minority groups. The researchers found that the more that participants endorsed egalitarian advocacy, the more money they wanted to go to women and racial minorities — and the less they wanted to go to older people. Questionnaire results showed that this was driven by a belief that older people block women and racial minorities from getting ahead. “Together, this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some,” write Martin and North.</p>



<p>Is there any way, then, to encourage people to be less ageist? Well, the pair did also find that when participants were informed about the true, difficult economic state of many older people in the US — many of whom simply cannot afford to retire — this made a difference. In fact, after this intervention, participants who were more egalitarian showed the biggest reductions in their bias against older people.</p>



<p>The pair then looked for possible nuances in prejudice against older people. They found that though biases were strongest against older White men, older Black women were also subject to them. (They did explore who participants had in mind when thinking about older people who “should” step aside, and though older White men certainly did feature, the group was much broader.) Egalitarians did, though, report “liking” and wanting to interact with older Black women more. So, as the researchers note, this particular older group was supported in other ways.</p>



<p>Of course, older people represent a fast-growing demographic. This means there’s an urgent need for more research into ageism, and how it might be tackled. Current diversity initiatives focus far more frequently on race, gender and LGBTQ, rather than age, the researchers note. “As organisations contribute more money than ever before to increasing diversity, it is increasingly necessary to take stock of who is being included, versus who is being left behind,” the pair writes.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-08078-001">Equality for (almost) all: Egalitarian advocacy predicts lower endorsement of sexism and racism, but not ageism.</a></p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
"microstates".</p>
<p>To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.</p>
<p>We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It’s not hard to find ways to stay busy during lockdown. Yes, many of us are spending lots of time at home and have evenings and weekends free from almost any kind of social activity — but we’re also juggling work, chores, childcare, life admin and the various emotional demands of living through a global pandemic.</p>



<p>For some, in fact, staying busy has been an appealing prospect; indeed, hundreds of articles have been written with ideas on how to stay busy and distracted <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/18/how-to-deal-with-boredom-digested/">during the boredom of lockdown</a>. But a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244631">new study</a> from a team at Australia’s RMIT University, published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, suggests that <em>meaningful</em> activity, rather than simply busyness, may be the way to stay emotionally stable during this period.</p>



<span id="more-41518"></span>



<p>All 95 participants were adults engaging in some form of social distancing. After sharing demographic data, participants rated themselves on a number of wellbeing measures, both as they were at the time of the study and as they were one month before the start of social distancing. These measures covered anxiety, panic, loneliness, depression, crying, cheerfulness, contentedness and laughter. Through these measures, the team was able to measure change in both positive and negative affect.</p>



<p>Participants also indicated how much time they had spent on various activities before and during social distancing, including being outside the home, talking online and off, engaging with childcare or other chores, working, watching TV, reading or other creative pursuits, and doing nothing. Participants also indicated how important they felt each activity was to them.</p>



<p>When, during lockdown, participants began to engage in more activities they found meaningful, they saw a reduction in both positive and negative affect. But increased busyness with activities participants didn’t consider important was related to <em>increases</em> in both positive and negative mood.</p>



<p>At first glance, this seems to suggest that busyness is more desirable overall — you might be crying more, but you’re also laughing, right? The team thinks not. Instead, they argue that the extremes induced by busy but meaningless activity suggests participants were unsettled and unable to regulate their emotions. In other words, while busyness can make you feel more agitated and therefore prone to mood swings, meaningful activity is more likely to calm you down, soothing both extremes.</p>



<p>As senior author Lauren Saling <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/media-releases-and-expert-comments/2021/jan/lockdown-busyness">puts it</a>, “extreme emotions are not necessarily a good thing… when you’re doing what you love, it makes sense that you feel more balanced – simply keeping busy isn’t satisfying.”</p>



<p>There are some obvious limitations to the work — for one, the fact that participants had to recall how they felt a month before lockdown started. It’s easy to imagine that at least some participants would have been unable to accurately recall how they felt, perhaps even romanticising fairly mundane activities which they were, at that point, barred from doing. And away from individual emotions, how much were lockdown activities impacting <em>general</em> life satisfaction?</p>



<p>We’re now nearly a year into various kinds of lockdown, so it’s easy to look at studies like this and beat yourself up, especially if you’re spending more time aimlessly playing video games than engaging in activities you know you’d probably find more meaningful. We’re all doing what we can to cope with distressing (and incredibly tedious) circumstances — but trying to balance meaning and mindlessness might be one way for us all to do that better.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How important is it to you to protect our planet’s wildest places? Would you put a price on it — or is it the kind of goal that just can’t be subject to a cost-benefit analysis? If the latter, then for you, protecting Earth’s wilds is a “sacred value”. Patriotism, or the protection of human lives, or diversity in the workplace can be sacred values, too. So what happens when a for-profit organisation embraces such values — is the pursuit of social or environmental values <em>and</em> profit a “win-win”, as is often claimed?</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-07851-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes</em>, suggests not — and it’s the value that suffers, as it becomes less sacred. If this is right, then businesses that co-opt such values in their advertising (think no end of outdoor clothing companies that make a big deal about caring for the wilderness, as just one example) are degrading the very values that they claim to promote.</p>



<span id="more-41501"></span>



<p>Rachel L Ruttan at the University of Toronto and Loran F Nordgren at Northwestern University base their conclusions on the results of seven studies on a total of 2,785 participants. In initial studies, participants who read a pro-environment message from a for-profit producer of agricultural equipment subsequently felt that environmentalism was less sacred than did participants who’d read the same message, but from the environmental body Conservation International. The “sacredness scale” used by the researchers assessed levels of feeling that a value (such as environmentalism) is “sacred”, and something that should not be sacrificed, no matter the benefits, but rather defended under any circumstance.</p>



<p>In a further study, participants who read that an organisation was launching a pro-environmental campaign to drive greater profits or for better PR subsequently felt that environmentalism was less sacred, compared with participants who’d read that the new campaign was driven by a desire for greater sustainability.</p>



<p>Earlier work has suggested that when a value is overtly threatened, this <em>reinforces</em> the desire of someone who upholds that value to protect it. However, the use of sacred values in the pursuit of corporate gain might not always seem like an obvious threat to these values, point out the researchers. Indeed, when Ruttan and Nordgren explored this in two further studies, the sacredness of a value was only degraded when participants did <em>not</em> perceive an action as clearly threatening or undermining that value . So, to keep with the same example (though of course there are others), when an outdoor clothing company pledges to donate a portion of its profits to protecting areas of wilderness, though this might seem like a “good thing”, it could work insidiously to degrade the sanctity of the value of wilderness protection — which could ultimately weaken protection efforts.</p>



<p>This possibility is supported by the results of the seventh study. In 2015, two US senators (including John McCain) issued a report documenting how the NFL was being paid by the US military to put on patriotic displays. This was widely picked up by US media. The researchers wondered whether people who were aware of this “paid patriotism” would subsequently hold patriotism as being less sacred. So they gave online participants a quiz that was ostensibly about their knowledge of the NFL, but which included this question: “Is it true or false that the term ‘Paid Patriotism’ was used to describe the practice of NFL teams accepting money to put on patriotic displays at games?”</p>



<p>Next, the participants were asked for their opinion on a purported potential NFL policy change: that singing the national anthem at games would become voluntary, and the choice of individual teams, rather than mandatory. The researchers found that participants who were aware of paid patriotism were significantly less likely to feel that “no matter how great the benefits, this shouldn’t be done”; that is, they were less likely to hold patriotism sacred. (This link held when controlling for a range of factors, including political orientation, education and a history of military service.) The results suggest that an awareness of paid patriotism decreased the sanctity of the value of patriotism.</p>



<p>“As markets increasingly interface with our sacred values — be it through advertisements, product offerings, promoting the strategic advantages of a diverse workforce, or Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives — it becomes increasingly important to understand the effects of using sacred values towards market aims on perceptions of and commitment to values,” the researchers write. </p>



<p>Clearly, there’s a lot more work to be done in this area — to investigate whether the same effects might hold in other countries, as well as in more real-world scenarios, for example. But it does suggest that if “do-gooder” actions and initiatives by companies are perceived to be driven by a desire to enhance the bottom line, this could undermine the very value that they’re endorsing — whether it springs from a “win-win” motivation, or not.</p>

<p>Author: Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer</p>



<p>We are delighted to announce the creation of the PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council">Scientific Advisory Council</a>, a small group of active researchers with diverse perspectives to help us shape our efforts to promote Open Science, globally.</p>



<p>PLOS, as a non-profit organization committed to empowering researchers to change research communication, cannot successfully pursue its mission without listening to the research community. We regularly survey and consult the research communities we work with, formally and informally, to guide our choices and developments. The organization’s governance, including our <a href="https://plos.org/about/board-of-directors/">Board of Directors</a>, has always involved active researchers. And we derive great insight and advice from our continuous exchange with the academic Editors of PLOS journals. </p>



<p>We’ve decided to take an additional formal step and create a forum where the researchers who contribute to PLOS through different channels can interact directly with each other, and to ensure that this forum includes voices from researchers around the globe. </p>



<p>We’ve created the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council, a small group of researchers who represent varied scientific and career perspectives, who will advise PLOS executive and editorial leadership on strategic questions of scientific interest. </p>



<p>At this point, the Scientific Advisory Council is deliberately small–about a dozen individuals–to ensure in-depth discussions and engagement, but we’ve strived to include different disciplinary interests, career stages and geographic representation. The group includes four PLOS Board members who are themselves active researchers, two of our journals’ academic Editors-in-Chief, alongside researchers who are not formally associated with PLOS. </p>



<p>We are delighted to welcome the following members to the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council. To see their photos and full bios, please visit their <a href="https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council">page </a>on our website: </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>What — or who — do you think about when you hear the word “atheist”? Someone scientific, rational, and open-minded? Or, instead, someone who lacks morality, or who is less trustworthy than your average religious person? Prior research hasn’t been wholly positive for non-believers, finding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/24/distrust-of-atheists-is-deeply-and-culturally-ingrained-even-among-atheists/">serious levels of distrust</a> of atheists — even among atheists themselves.</p>



<p>But the real picture might be slightly more complicated. According to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620982703">a new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, positive <em>and</em> negative stereotypes abound when it comes to atheists. And for many, these stereotypes exist at the same time: people can believe atheists to be fun and open-minded just as they find them to be immoral.</p>



<span id="more-41493"></span>



<p>Although past work has mainly looked at negative stereotypes of atheists, there is reason to believe that people could, simultaneously, hold positive stereotypes. You might perceive atheists as uninhibited and rebellious and want to invite them to a party or have them serve you at a restaurant, for example — but you may not want them to look after your children for exactly the same reason.</p>



<p>The first study looked precisely at these traits, testing the hypothesis that people see atheists as fun, open-minded and scientific (and the religious as the opposite). Participants were randomly assigned to read three vignettes in which a character either displayed one of these three traits (e.g. fun), or its opposite (e.g. not fun). They were then asked which of two sentences about the character seemed more probable. One statement was standalone and the other was linked to religion or atheism: e.g. “Henry is a teacher” or “Henry is a teacher and [an atheist/believes in God]”.</p>



<p>Participants were more likely to link being fun, open-minded and scientific to atheism, while they viewed the opposite traits as more representative of religious people. The extent to which this was true varied based on how religious the participants were themselves: people of high and low religiosity believed atheists were fun and scientific, but highly religious people were less likely to consider atheists as particularly open-minded. A second study replicated these findings, as well as adding another element: the stereotype of atheists as immoral, which participants tended to agree with. </p>



<p>A third study looked at the contexts in which people prefer atheists or religious people. Participants were presented with a choice between the two in a number of hypothetical situations, each related to the positive stereotypes identified in the first two studies: e.g. “which would you choose if you wanted to attend a fun party: one thrown by an atheist or by a religious person?”, “which would you choose if you wanted to have an open-minded political conversation with someone?” or “which would you choose if you wanted a tutor for a high-level college course in the physical sciences?” To disguise the purpose of the study, five distractor scenarios (e.g. hiring a mechanic) were included with five different targets (e.g. Mac users vs. PC users).</p>



<p>As expected, participants preferred atheist partners in fun, open-minded and scientific situations. This was not the case for highly religious participants, however — while they had no bias towards religious or atheist party hosts, they did strongly favour conversational partners and science tutors who shared their beliefs.</p>



<p>The team suggests that the results could have serious implications for non-believers: though being considered fun is hardly the worst thing in the world, it could also lead to negative ramifications like being passed over for career opportunities or being seen as an inappropriate romantic prospect. It would be interesting to explore how much positive and negative stereotypes actually stand in the way for atheists in the real world, and in what domains.</p>



<p>Overall, the study paints an interesting picture of how we see both atheists and religious people — and how our own beliefs colour those pictures. While some certainly do have firm, rigid ideas about certain groups, these results suggest that for many of us stereotyping is somewhat more fluid.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/usa-1120579_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol and firearms are a dangerous combination and are commonly involved in suicide in the United States. This has only increased in importance as a public health issue as alcohol drinking, firearm sales, and suicides in the United States have all increased since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. State alcohol policies and state firearm policies might impact alcohol and firearm related suicide, but it is unknown how these policies specifically relate to these suicides, or how these policies might interact with one another.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess relationships between alcohol policies, firearm policies, and U.S. suicides in 2015 involving alcohol, firearms, or both. We used the Alcohol Policy Scale, previously created and validated by our team, to assess alcohol policies and the Gun Law Scorecard from Giffords Law Center to quantify firearm policies. Suicide data came from the National Violent Death Reporting System. State- and individual-level GEE Poisson and logistic regression models assessed relationships between policies and firearm- and/or alcohol-involved suicides with a 1-year lag.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the United States in 2015, alcohol and/or firearms were involved in 63.9% of suicides. Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 28% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol or firearms. Similarly, a 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 14% decrease in the rate of suicides involving firearms.</p>
<p>These relationships were similar for suicides that involved alcohol and firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 52% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms. A 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 26% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.</p>
<p>In addition, we found synergistic effects between alcohol and firearm policies, such that states with restrictive policies for both alcohol and firearms had the lowest odds of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and next steps</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Results of the study suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals, including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.</p></blockquote>
<p>We found restrictive alcohol and firearm policies to be associated with lower rates and odds of suicides involving alcohol or firearms, and alcohol and firearms and our research suggests that alcohol and firearm policies may be a promising means by which to reduce suicide. These protective relationships were particularly striking for suicides involving both alcohol and firearms as well as in the strong protective interaction between alcohol and firearm policy variables, particularly for suicides involving alcohol. These findings, taken in the context of the broader literature, also suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals (so-called ‘may issue’ laws), including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.</p>
<p>Because this was a cross-sectional analysis, this should be considered a hypothesis-generating study that cannot prove a causal association between alcohol or firearm policies and suicide. In future research, studies using multiple years of policy and suicide data would strengthen causal inference.</p>
<p>Stronger alcohol and firearm policies are a promising means to prevent a leading and increasing cause of death in the U.S. The findings further suggest that strengthening both policy areas may have a synergistic impact on reducing suicides involving either alcohol, firearms, or both.</p>

I anticipate this story like a good mystery novel with wry throwaway observations (p. 82):</p><p></p><blockquote>“Neuroimaging—functional MRI—shows us Technicolor images of the cortex, its regions lit up in a swirling riot of poorly chosen colors that make the <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021" target="_blank">Pantone</a> people cry into their tasteful coffee mugs.”</blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s698/Pantone%2B2021.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="662" data-original-width="698" height="303" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h303/Pantone%2B2021.png" width="320" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Pantone colors of 2021 are <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021" target="_blank" title="PANTONE 17-5104 Ultimate Gray">gray</a> and <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021" target="_blank" title="PANTONE 13-0647 Illuminating">yellow</a></span><br /></p><p> </p><p>Wherever it ends up – with a mind-blowing new vision of the brain based on spontaneous spikes, or with just another opinion on predictive coding theory – I predict <i>THE SPIKE</i> will be an epic and entertaining journey. </p><p> </p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s845/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="845" data-original-width="800" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/w379-h400/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png" width="379" /></a></div><br /><div class="feedflare">

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>In 2001, Air Transat Flight 236 lost engine power and made an emergency landing in the Azores. All passengers survived, but for 30 terrifying minutes, many thought they were going to die. </strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remember-disaster-without-being-shattered-ptsd-covid/?utm_source=twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social">Writing for <em>Wired</em>, Erika Hayasaki has the fascinating story</a> of one of those passengers, Margaret McKinnon, a psychologist who then went on to study why some survivors developed PTSD and others did not — and who is now looking at the mental health of frontline workers during the pandemic.  </p>

<p><strong>Although we often think of mental health disorders as falling neatly into discrete categories — “depression”, say — the reality is that they can present quite differently in different people.</strong> So could treatments like brain stimulation be personalised to individuals? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/magazine/brain-stimulation-mental-health.html">Kim Tingley takes a look</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>.   </p>

<p><strong>Many of us experience a feeling of dread when the phone rings — or when we have to make a call.</strong> At <em>The Conversation</em>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/phone-call-anxiety-why-so-many-of-us-have-it-and-how-to-get-over-it-155798">Ilham Sebah explains</a> why we experience phone anxiety, and what we can do to get over it. (And, as we reported last year, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/08/phone-calls-help-create-closer-bonds-than-texting/">you may actually get more out of phone calls than you expect</a>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Undark</em> <a href="https://undark.org/2021/02/26/podcast-53-psychedelic-drugs-mental-health/">has a nice podcast</a> this week about the hope — and hype — surrounding the use of psychedelics as antidepressants. </strong>It’s a great place to start for a balanced overview of where the field is at.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>We reported earlier this week on the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/24/dolphins-personality-traits-are-surprisingly-similar-to-our-own/">similarities between dolphin and human personalities</a> — but do dolphins also have “handedness” like humans? </strong>Past work had suggested that the aquatic mammals showed behavioural asymmetries in their movements, preferring to spin rightward. But a new study casts doubt on those findings, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-dolphins-right-handed-or-left-handed/">writes researcher Kelly Jaakkola</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>“Mini-brains” — brain organoids grown from stem cells in the lab — are used to study the development of the human brain, though they are far more primitive than real brains. </strong>But researchers have reported a surprising finding: after around 9 months, even these basic organoids show changes in gene expression similar to that in human babies after birth. The results suggest that mini-brains may be useful for studying disorders that emerge after birth, rather than just prenatally, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/brain-cell-clusters-grown-lab-more-year-mirror-changes-newborn-s-brain">reports Kelly Servick</a> at <em>Science</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>A lot of human neuroscience is about finding a signal in all of the background noise — identifying which regions are more active during a certain task, say, while ignoring the other activity that is going on in the brain.</strong> But what if there is useful information in all of that noise? At <em>Wired</em>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-brains-background-noise-may-be-meaningful-after-all/">Elizabeth Landau reports on studies</a> that have linked patterns of white noise within EEG data to aspects of behaviour and cognition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/">Why arXiv needs a brand</a></h4>

<p><strong>Pop quiz: There are so many “-Xivs” online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: only <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv"><strong>@arXiv</strong></a></p>
<p>arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.</p>
<p>“As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,” said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.</p>
<p>In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.</p>
<p>Throughout the identity project, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>assessed user feedback collected since 2016,</li>
<li>surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,</li>
<li>gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,</li>
<li>contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and</li>
<li>are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To guide our branding efforts we focused on <b>arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science</b>. After many rounds of revision and refinement, <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">arXiv’s first brand guide</a> was produced, in addition to our new logo and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a>, and we’d like to share them with you now.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_948" style="width: 300px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png"><img alt="arXiv's logo" class="wp-image-948 size-medium" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;" width="260" /></a>The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection</figure>
<p>The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, <strong>the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo</strong> captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf">brand guide</a> and <a href="https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf">usage guidelines</a> ensure that we express arXiv’s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.</p>
<p>The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.</p>
<p>“arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,” said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.</p>

<h2>Where is the red nucleus?</h2><p class="">The red nucleus is found in a region of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem" target="_blank">brainstem</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/midbrain" target="_blank">midbrain</a>. There are actually two red nuclei—one on each side of the brainstem. </p><p class="">The red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures that are generally distinct in function: the parvocellular red nucleus, which mainly contains small and medium-sized <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a>, and the magnocellular red nucleus, which contains larger neurons. The red nucleus is recognizable immediately after dissection because it maintains a reddish coloring. This coloring is thought to be due to iron pigments found in the cells of the nucleus.</p><h2>What is the red nucleus and what does it do?</h2><p class="">As mentioned above, the red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures with separate functions: the parvocellular red nucleus and the magnocellular red nucleus. In the human brain, most of the red nucleus is made up of the parvocellular red nucleus, or RNp; the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is not thought to play a major role in the adult human brain. In four-legged mammals (e.g., cats, mice), however, the RNm is a more prominent structure—in both size and importance.</p><p class="">Neurons from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum" target="_blank">cerebellum</a> project to the RNm, and RNm neurons leave the red nucleus and form the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/rubrospinal-tract" target="_blank">rubrospinal tract</a>, which descends in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>. In animals that walk on four legs, this pathway is activated around the time of voluntary movements; it seems to play an important role in walking, avoiding obstacles, and making coordinated paw movements. RNm neurons, however, also respond to sensory stimulation, and may provide sensory feedback to the cerebellum to help guide movements and maintain postural stability. </p><p class="">In primates that mainly walk on two legs (including humans), the RNm is not thought to play a large role in walking and maintaining postural stability, as other tracts (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticospinal-tract" target="_blank">corticospinal tract</a>) take over such functions. The RNm, however, does appear to be involved in controlling hand movements in humans and other primates. Interestingly, the RNm is more prominent in the human fetus and newborn, but regresses as a child ages, which may have to do with the development of corticospinal tract and the ability to walk on two legs.</p><p class="">Despite its relatively greater import in the human brain, the RNp is poorly understood, as its diminished presence in other animals makes it more difficult to study using an animal model. Neurons from motor areas in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/prefrontal-cortex" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/premotor-cortex" target="_blank">premotor cortex</a>, as well as neurons from nuclei in the cerebellum known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-cerebellar-nuclei" target="_blank">deep cerebellar nuclei</a>, extend to the RNp. There is also a collection of neurons that leave the RNp and travel to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-olivary-nucleus" target="_blank">inferior olivary nucleus</a>, which communicates with the cerebellum and is thought to be involved in the control of movement. A number of proposed functions have been attributed to these connections between the RNp, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus, such as movement learning, the acquisition of reflexes, and the detection of errors in movements. But the precise function of these pathways—and thus the RNp’s role in them—is still not clear.</p><p class="">Several studies have found the red nucleus to play a role in pain sensation as well as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/analgesia" target="_blank">analgesia</a>. The latter might be due to connections between the red nucleus and regions like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/periaqueductal-gray" target="_blank">periaqueductal gray</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/raphe-nuclei" target="_blank">raphe nuclei</a>, which are part of a natural pain-inhibiting system in the brain. </p><p class="">In terms of pathology, dysfunction in the human red nucleus has been linked to the development of tremors, and is being investigated as playing a potential role in <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Damage to the red nucleus has also been associated with a number of other problems with movement and muscle tone.</p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Basile GA, Quartu M, Bertino S, Serra MP, Boi M, Bramanti A, Anastasi GP, Milardi D, Cacciola A.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/hookah-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Water pipe smoking as a public health crisis</strong></p>
<p>Water Pipe Smoking (WPS) accounts for a significant and growing share of tobacco use globally. WPS is a culture-based method of tobacco use and it has experienced a worldwide re-emergence since 1990 and is regaining popularity among different groups of populations, especially in school and university students. Similarly, WPS is also prevalent among highly educated groups. Although WPS is most prevalent in Asia, specifically the Middle East region and Africa, it has now been changed to a rapidly emerging problem in other continents such as Europe, North, and South America.</p>
<blockquote><p>WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been shown that WPS’ smoking rate can be more addictive compared to that of the cigarette. It has a huge negative impact on populations’ health, health costs and the gross domestic product of the countries. WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS. Using deceptive advertising, many cafes and restaurants offer WP services along with their orthodox services in order to earn more profit and lure more customers. The provision of flavored tobacco products or psychotropic WP, the proximity of WP cafe to the public settings such as educational or residential settings and sports clubs, tempting decoration, the provision of study places for students, live music, a variety of games and gambling, and the possibility of watching live movie and sport matches are the factors contribute to attracting children and adolescents to WP cafes.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of our study</strong></p>
<p>Despite the concerns about WPS outcomes and nearly three decades of using control measures, the prevalence of WPS has increased over the world. Due to the unique nature of WP (multi-components), little is known about the prevention and control of WPS. Thus, special interventions might be required to prevent and control WP tobacco use. Accordingly, our study published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> aimed to identify the management interventions in international and national levels for preventing and controlling water pipe smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We conducted a systematic literature review. Studies aiming at evaluating, at least, one intervention in preventing and controlling WPS were included in this review, followed by performing the quality assessment and data extraction of eligible studies by two independent investigators.</p>
<p>After deleting duplications, 2228 out of 4343 retrieved records remained and 38 studies were selected as the main corpus of the present study. The selected studies focused on 19 different countries including the United States (13.15 %), the United Kingdom (7.89 %), Germany (5.26 %), Iran (5.26 %), Egypt (5.26%), Malaysia (2.63%), India (2.63%), Denmark (2.63%), Pakistan (2.63%), Qatar (2.63%), Jordan(2.63%), Lebanon (2.63%), Syria (2.63%), Turkey (2.63%), Bahrain (2.63%), Israel (2.63%), the United Arab Emirates (2.63%), Saudi Arabia (2.63%), and Switzerland (2.63%). Additionally, the type of study design included cross-sectional (31.57 %), quasi-experimental (15.78 %) and qualitative types (23.68 %).</p>
<p>Interventions that were identified from the content analysis process were discussed and classified into relevant categories. We identified 27 interventions that were grouped into four main categories including preventive (5,18.51%) and control (8, 29.62%) interventions, as well as the enactment and implementation of legislations and policies for controlling WPS at national (7, 25.92%) and international (7, 25.92%) levels. The interventions are shown in the following table.</p>

<p><strong>Study implications</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, our findings indicated WPS related social and health crisis have not come into attention in high levels of policy making. The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence. In addition, the WP industry is rapidly expanding without monitoring and controlling measures. Informing and empowering adolescents for those who have not yet experienced smoking is a sensible intervention in this regard. Besides, empowering and involving health students and professionals in WPS control programs can lead to promising results in preventing and controlling WPS. It seems that there is a paucity of evidence regarding strategies on controlling and preventing WTS, thus further research in the society is warranted in this respect.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p>Back in the 1970s, the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget discovered that, if you ask young children to explain the mechanics of vision as they understand them, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-24948-001">their answers tend to reveal the exact same misconception</a>: that the eyes emit some sort of immaterial substance into the environment and capture the sights of objects much like a projector.</p>



<p>Although this belief declines with age, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12094435/">it is still surprisingly prevalent in adults</a>. What’s more, so-called extramission theories of vision have a long-running history dating all the way back to antiquity. The Greek philosopher Empedocles was amongst the first to suggest in the 5<sup>th</sup> century BC that our ability to see must stem from an invisible fire beaming out of our eyes to interact with our surroundings. This view was subsequently endorsed by intellectual authorities like Ptolemy and Galen.</p>



<p>Now, a duo of researchers behind a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/50/32165">recent publication in <em>PNAS</em></a> think they might have found an explanation for the intuitive appeal of extramission theories. According to their paper, this worldview might just be a reflection of the mechanisms that play out within our brains when we follow other people’s gazes and track where they pay attention. This is because, to carry out this process, our brains actually conjure illusory beams of motion emanating from other’s faces — a quirk of evolution with interesting consequences.</p>



<span id="more-41455"></span>



<p>Scientists had already found signs that this was taking place. For instance, when people spend time looking at an image of someone gazing sideways at an object, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008220300526">they temporarily become slower at spotting subtle movement in that same direction</a>. It is as if our brains treat the experience of seeing a pair of glancing eyes as an animated display of motion flowing towards the object of attention. This fatigues the brain region responsible for processing movement and renders it briefly “blind” to real motion along that same direction.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, an fMRI brain scanning study further deepened scientists’ suspicions. It showed that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/23/13162#:~:text=Specific%20regions%20of%20the%20human,to%20the%20gazed%2Dupon%20object.&amp;text=of%20visual%20attention.-,It%20is%20as%20if%20the%20brain%20draws%20a%20quick%20visual,who%20is%20attending%20to%20what">watching someone gazing at an object activated the motion-sensitive regions of our brains</a> in a pattern that was remarkably similar to that triggered by the experience of viewing actual motion.  </p>



<p>Tantalising as this evidence was, it was virtually impossible to conclude that this motion signal played any causal role in how we track people’s attention. Sceptical researchers suggested that the signal might simply reflect study participants imagining people reaching for the objects of their interest.</p>



<p>With this in mind, Arvid Guterstam and Michael Graziano — the Princeton University psychologists behind the recent <em>PNAS</em> publication — decided to set the causal record straight. They did this by testing whether meddling with the brain’s internal motion signal, using real (but subliminal) movement, could manipulate people’s perceptions of where someone was attending.</p>



<p>In their study, participants looked at a screen where two faces, set against a background of randomly moving black dots, gazed in the general direction of an object located at the center. They were asked to indicate which face seemed to be paying more attention to that item. But unbeknownst to them, these faces were actually mirror images, so participants unsurprisingly selected one or the other face with equal probability.</p>



<p>This changed when the researchers stealthily introduced a subtle signal in the background: a beam-shaped area emanating from the one of the faces, in which 30% of dots were made to drift coherently in the direction of the object. The manipulation was subtle enough that only seven out of over 650 participants were actually aware of it. And yet, it had a significant impact on how they attributed attention. On the trials where the subliminal beam of motion was flowing away from the left face, participants were 6% more likely to judge that face as paying more attention to the object — a significant deviation from their baseline indecisiveness.  </p>



<p>Importantly, this motion-induced bias completely vanished when the dots moved in the opposite direction — i.e. from the object to the face. This suggests that our brains don’t fabricate motion signals for <em>all </em>interactions between objects in our surroundings. Rather, they reserve them for the social act of inferring the connection between someone’s gaze and the object of their attention. The byproduct of this, claim the study’s authors, is the inexplicable sensation that people’s eyes emit beams of immaterial substance. And even though this takes place outside the realm of our awareness, it might just be the driving force behind extramission theories’ historic and intuitive allure.</p>



<p>One almost cannot help but wonder whether this quirk of the brain also shapes how we intuitively think about mythical creatures. Indeed, aliens and robots with so-called “<a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optic_weaponry">optic weaponry</a>” have a propensity to pop up <a href="https://screenrant.com/raised-wolves-mother-powers-eyes-explained/">in works of science fiction</a>, while medieval and classical-era tales are packed with beasts with killer glares (look no further than the <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-extremely-real-science-behind-the-basilisks-lethal-gaze/">basilisk</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Medusa/">Gorgon Medusa</a>, whose lethal gaze spurred the Greek hero Perseus to bring a reflective shield to his assassination attempt on the monster).</p>



<p>Of course, scientists will be hard pressed to prove that the historical and developmental appeal of extramission theories really is a reflection of the way our brains process gaze and attention. But these coincidences do raise interesting questions about the deep-seated role our fundamental neural mechanisms play in shaping our intuitions and imaginations — children and philosophers alike.</p>

<p>Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology/">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></h4>

<p>Was Darwin a one-trick pony? The scientists who most praise him typically cite just one of his ideas: natural selection. Do any know that his theory of evolution—like his take on psychology—presumed all creatures were agents? This fact has long been eclipsed by the “gene’s-eye view” of adaptation which gained a strangle-hold over biology during the twentieth century—and hence over sociobiology and today’s evolutionary psychology. Are current efforts to revise this view—emphasising “new” topics like the flexibility of phenotypes (an organism’s living characteristics) and the importance of development in adaptation—simply rediscovering Darwin’s approach?</p><p>How do members of a species come to differ from each other, thus furnishing the raw material for the struggle whose results Darwin subsumed under what he called the <em>law</em> of natural selection? In two ways, wrote Darwin in 1859. A creature’s parents <em>transmit</em> different characteristics to them as starting-points for their lives. And, over their life-course, creatures <em>develop</em> their starting-characteristics in different ways, depending on how they respond to the various challenges they meet. In 1942, Julian Huxley and his colleagues recast natural selection as <em>a mechanism</em>, not a law. Imagine twinned roulette-wheels: each individual’s evolutionary fate resulted from a random genetic provision of phenotypic traits being pitted against a lottery of environmental events. This new language of genes, genomes, and (from 1953) DNA, made Darwin look ignorant about how individual differences arose. Dying before genes or DNA were discovered, he never knew that mutations and chromosome-changes caused all variations (according to Huxley).</p><p>To retain Darwin as the figurehead of this gene-first take on nature, he was retro-fitted with twentieth-century beliefs. If DNA “programmes” what creatures are and do, genetic processes drive evolution forward, not creaturely acts. Hence, Huxley asserted, the “great merit” of Darwin was his proof that living organisms never acted purposively: everything they did could be accounted for “on good mechanistic principles.” Likewise, even when Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin spoke out <em>against</em> the way the cult of genes blinds us to the active role organisms play in adaptation, his first target was Darwin, who, Lewontin said, portrayed organisms “as passive objects moulded by the external force of natural selection.”</p><p>Lewontin’s vouch that organisms help shape their own fates is now gaining traction. Few genes behave as they should according to Mendel. So, talk about genes “for” a phenotypic character is rarely appropriate. Even when we know everything we can about genes and environment, we still cannot predict what characteristics will emerge in an organism—proving phenotypes are independent sources of plasticity in the genesis of adaptations. Organisms help cause their own development and destiny, which means phenotypes themselves have evolutionary effects. Never mind why a fly hatches from its pupa to be small: its unusually big surface to volume ratio cannot help but shape its remaining life-history. This point underlines findings from biologists who study animal behaviour. Beavers build dams, chimps and crows make tools, wolves hunt better in packs. All such feats alter the evolutionary prospects of phenotypes.</p><p>Darwin’s books herald all these emphases: the distinction between transmission and development when discussing inheritance; the “plasticity of organisation” in all creatures; and, importantly here, the tie between action and structure. Darwin saw nature as a theatre of agency. The roots of cabbage seedlings successfully improvised, after Darwin experimentally blocked them from plunging straight down into the earth. Earthworms “intelligently” grasped how best to tug his artificially-shaped “leaves” to plug their holes against the cold. And when newly-arrived finches were competing for food on the Galapagos Islands, it must have been the birds who first found the best new diets—not random genetic changes—who gained reproductive supremacy and consequently, over millennia, such new bodily adaptations as the skin-piercing beak of blood-sucking Vampire Finches.</p><p>Actions produce reactions, <em>The</em> <em>Origin of Species</em> repeatedly reminds us. Which means an organism’s actions inevitably render it interdependent with its habitat, animate and inanimate. Such ties may be competitive or cooperative—“mutual aid” being the hallmark of evolution in “social animals” like us. Hence, when Darwin published his views on human agency in <em>The Descent of Man</em>—first published 150 years ago this month—and its sequel, <em>The Expression of the Emotions</em> (1872), social interdependency took pride of place. Darwin argued non-verbal expressions to be <em>purposeless</em> by-products of functional habits—we weep because we protectively close our eyes when screaming, incidentally squeezing our tear-glands. Such unintended side-effects only come to signify emotion because <em>others “</em>recognize” their meaning as linked to suffering. When I blush, my inbuilt capacity for reading expressions has rebounded, leading me to read in you how I imagine you to be reading me. Such “self-attention” underpins sexual display, plus such quintessentially human traits as language, culture, and conscience.</p><p>Go back to what Darwin wrote about evolution, and you will hear him speaking from a place that the latest biology now renders prescient. Interdependencies of agency not only forge individual differences, and winnow the kernels of inter-generational success from the chaff of failure. They also compose Darwin’s unsung creation of the first naturalistic psychology.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/sky-sunset-darwin-mangrove-horizon-2910165/">Pat Josse</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/645043306/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/645043306/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/turning-geology-into-archaeology-how-two-businessmen-changed-the-face-of-time/" rel="nofollow">Turning geology into archaeology: how two businessmen changed the face of time</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/" rel="nofollow">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-queer-plots-in-the-descent-of-man/" rel="nofollow">Darwin’s queer plots in The Descent of Man</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We’re all familiar with the “<a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199828340/obo-9780199828340-0120.xml">Big Five</a>” model of personality, which measures the traits of conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness. But what drove the evolution of these personality domains? And how do animal personalities compare with ours? Answers to the second question can help to answer the first. And now a major <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-08130-001">new study</a> of personality in bottlenose dolphins, published in the <em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em>, has found that in some key ways, dolphin personality is like ours; in others, though, it is not.</p>



<span id="more-41442"></span>



<p>The 134 dolphins studied by Blake Morton at the University of Hull and colleagues were all kept in captivity in 15 centres in eight different countries. Staff who had known the dolphins for at least a year rated each animal on a 49-item Dolphin Personality Questionnaire, adapted from a similar questionnaire for primates. Staff indicated the extent to which dolphins showed various traits, such as “exhibitionistic, flamboyant” (for dolphins who regularly try to attract visitors’ attention, say), “aggressive”, “sociable”, “erratic”, “playful”, “easygoing”, “suspicious”, and “stubborn”. Many of the dolphins were rated by two or more people, and the reasonable consistency between different people’s ratings for a single animal gave the team some confidence that these were accurate.</p>



<p>The team then analysed the data, and found that the traits clustered into four main groups, or domains: openness (a tendency to be active and explore the environment), disagreeableness (a tendency to be aggressive, jealous, despotic and obstinate), sociability (being friendly towards other dolphins and people), and “directedness”, characterised by consistency in behaviour, boldness, and low emotional arousal (this was like a blend of high conscientiousness and low neuroticism). In contrast to findings for chimpanzees or gorillas, a domain of “dominance” did not emerge. This domain is notably absent from human personality models, too, perhaps because neither dolphin nor human social groups feature very strong hierarchies, while chimp groups do, the team suggests.</p>



<p>As with orcas, California sea lions, mountain gorillas and bonobos, bottlenose dolphins don’t seem to have a domain of “neuroticism”, either. It’s been suggested that neuroticism is more likely to emerge in species that live in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3885165/">unpredictable environments</a> (the theory is that neurotic individuals may be more prone to anxiety but also more vigilant when it comes to spotting dangers in their environment — and an unpredictable environment requires greater vigilance). But the data on dolphins, which, as the researchers note, evolved in relatively unpredictable environments, runs counter to this idea. The questionnaire didn’t include many neuroticism-related items, however. More work is now needed to explore the origins of neuroticism in other animals as well as us, the team observes.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that conscientiousness evolves in species that need to pay close attention to other individuals — to carefully watch another using a tool, and so learn how to use it, for example. Though dolphins do learn to use tools from other dolphins, the team did not find evidence that conscientiousness, in and of itself, is a clear domain of their personality. Something like human conscientiousness has been observed in Asian elephants, however. These elephants have highly manipulatable and useful trunks, which are similar in some ways to our hands. Perhaps, then, the need to pay close attention to the use of hands (or trunks) in manipulating objects and caring for infants is important for the evolution of conscientiousness, the team suggests.</p>



<p>What about the similarities between the personalities of dolphins and people, beyond the lack of a trait of dominance? Openness has been found in other intelligent species that also live in groups, such as chimpanzees, as well as humans (but not orangutans, which don’t live in stable social groups). The finding for dolphins fits with this pattern, and more work is now needed to explore the extent to which one or both of these two factors might have contributed to the evolution of this trait, the team writes. Agreeableness (or disagreeableness) is also shared, but as the traits that relate to sociability in dolphins are different to those seen in humans and other  primates, more work is needed to explore this, too.</p>



<p>It will be fascinating simply to know more about other animals’ personalities, of course, but the team certainly also hopes that it will provide some broader insights into how our own human personality evolved: “Further work on cetaceans, other aquatic mammals and other vertebrates will lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary forces that unite and divide species that inhabit the surface and depths of our planet,” the team concludes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/srNfQp0KB-s/">PLOS and Yale University Announce Publishing Agreement</a></h4>

<p>Yale University posted the following announcement on its website on February 23, 2021</p>



<p>Yale University Library has signed two innovative agreements that will allow Yale-affiliated authors to publish in any PLOS open access journal without paying article processing charges (APCs).</p>



<p>PLOS is a non-profit, open access publisher of seven highly respected scientific and medical journals. Last year Yale authors published more than 100 articles in PLOS journals, with APCs of up to $3,000 per article. Effective Jan. 1, 2021, these author-paid APCs will be eliminated and replaced with annual fees paid by the library. The authors will maintain copyright ownership of their research.</p>



<p>“Our goal is to make open access publishing a more viable option for more Yale researchers in science and medicine, and to support a publication model that will also encourage open access publishing beyond Yale,” said Barbara Rockenbach, the Stephen Gates ’68 University Librarian.</p>



<p>Open access publishing has grown in popularity since the 1990s when peer-reviewed journals began publishing online with a traditional business model based on limited access and high subscription fees. Open access developed as an alternative to make new research quickly and widely available with financial support from those producing the research. However, financial support for APCs from academic departments, government, and other research funders has varied widely, with some authors having to pay from personal funds.</p>



<p>The library agreements will eliminate APCs for Yale authors publishing in PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS One, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Genetics, and PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, as well as in any new PLOS publications launched during the contract term. The initial agreements are for three years and will be funded through Yale Library’s Collection Development department with support from the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library.</p>



<p>“We are pleased that Yale Library can support this emerging, more sustainable model of open-access publishing,” Rockenbach said. “We are committed to facilitating equitable access to research in science and medicine–and the progress research fuels.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Over the last few years, conspiracy thinking seems to have mushroomed — most visibly perhaps in the US, where <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53498434">QAnon</a> supporters stormed the Capitol. Elsewhere, across the world, coronavirus-related conspiracies have abounded; one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/26/survey-uncovers-widespread-belief-dangerous-covid-conspiracy-theories">large-scale survey</a> conducted last year found that as many as one in five Britons believed the COVID-19 fatality rate may have been exaggerated.</p>



<p>We already know that certain factors make individuals particularly prone to conspiratorial thinking — their <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/05/why-more-highly-educated-people-are-less-into-conspiracy-theories/">level of education</a>, for example, or a desire to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">feel special</a>. And a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acp.3790?saml_referrer=">new study</a>, published in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, has identified another facet of cognition linked to conspiratorial beliefs: critical thinking. Anthony Lantian from Université Paris Nanterre and colleagues find that the higher the level of critical thinking, the lower the belief in conspiracy theories, potentially offering a path out of conspiratorial thinking for those particularly susceptible.</p>



<span id="more-41426"></span>



<p>In the first study, 86 participants were asked to complete a conspiracy belief scale, indicating how much they agreed with statements such as “certain significant events have been the result of the activity of a small group who secretly manipulate world events”.</p>



<p>They then took part in a critical thinking activity, reading a letter to the editor of a newspaper arguing that overnight parking should be banned in a particular area. Participants were asked to respond to each paragraph of the letter, assessing the relevance of the argument and evaluating the letter as whole, then wrote their responses in the form of a letter to the editor. These letters were assessed by judges on various measures of critical thinking, such as identifying good arguments, seeing other explanations, and avoiding over-generalisation. The team found that the higher participants scored on the critical thinking task, the less they believed in conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>However, the relationship in the first study didn’t quite reach significance. So a second study replicated the first, this time with more participants; overall, 252 took part. As well as completing the conspiracy thinking measure and the letter evaluation task, participants also reported on their own critical thinking skills.</p>



<p>Again, those with high levels of critical thinking ability were less likely to believe in conspiracy theories. Interestingly enough, however, conspiracy-minded participants didn’t seem aware of their critical thinking skills — both those with high and low levels of conspiracy thinking rated themselves highly on critical thinking. This makes sense when you consider the narratives of many conspiracy theory movements, which often frame themselves as <em>true</em> critical or free thinkers, seeing the light where others cannot.</p>



<p>The results may be useful when designing interventions to combat conspiratorial thinking — but being careful about how these are framed would be crucial. If someone truly believes in a specific conspiracy theory, telling them they lack critical thinking skills is unlikely to help and may instead further entrench them in their beliefs, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/955705495?t=1613490536672">researchers have highlighted</a> in coverage of QAnon. The study is also correlational — we can’t say, based on these results, that lack of critical thinking is the reason people believe conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>Further research could look at why critical thinking might protect against conspiratorial thinking, as well as explore <em>degrees</em> of conspiratorial thinking. When does somebody tip from “healthy scepticism”, as the team puts it, into full-on conspiracy? Where is the line between critically engaging with what the media or politicians tell us, for example, and labelling everything as “fake news”? Though media coverage may focus on the “true believers” of particular conspiracy theories, the journey to such a staunch position often begins somewhere far more reasonable; tracking this journey could provide valuable insight.</p>

<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichieHakim/status/1363545448317878282">Richie Hakim asked</a> whether the toolbox Cascade for spike inference (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github</a>) induces temporal dispersion of the predicted spiking activity compared to ground truth. This kind of temporal dispersion had been observed in a study from last year (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198">Wei et al., PLoS Comp Biol, 2020</a>; also discussed in a previous <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/">blog post</a>), suggesting that analyses based on raw or deconvolved calcium imaging data might falsely suggest continuous sequences of neuronal activations, while the true activity patterns are coming in discrete bouts.</p>



<p>To approach this question, I used one of our 27 ground truth datasets (the one recorded for the original GCaMP6f paper). From all recordings in this data set, I detected events that exceeded a certain ground truth spike rate. Next, I assigned these extracted events in 3 groups and systematically shifted the detected event of groups 1 and 3 by 0.5 seconds forth and back. Note that this is a short shift compared to the timescale investigated by the Wei et al. paper. This is how the ground truth looks like. It is clearly not a continuous sequence of activations:</p>

<p>To evaluate whether the three-bout pattern would result in a continuous sequence after spike inference, I just used the dF/F recordings associated with above ground truth recordings and Cascade’s global model for excitatory neurons (a pretrained network that is available with the toolbox), I infered the spike rates. There is indeed some dispersion due to the difficulty to infer spike rates from noisy data. But the three bouts are very clearly visible.</p>

<p>This is even more apparent when plotting the average spike rate across neurons:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6757" data-attachment-id="6757" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="noise2_3-1" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png" data-orig-size="1340,568" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_3-1/" height="212" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=1024" width="502" /></figure></div>



<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that there are conditions and existing datasets where discrete activity bouts can be clearly distinguished from sequential activations based on spike rates inferred with Cascade.</p>



<p>This analysis was performed on neurons at a standardized noise level of 2% Hz<sup>-1</sup> (see the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">preprint </a>for a proper definition of the standardized noise level). This is a typical and very decent noise level for population calcium imaging. However, if we perform the same analysis on the same data set but with a relatively high noise level of 8% Hz<sup>-1</sup>, the resulting predictions are indeed much more dispersed, since the dF/F patterns are too noisy to make more precise predictions. The average spike rate still shows three peaks, but they are only riding on top of a more broadly distributed, seemingly persistent increase of the spike rate.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/dynamique-et-controle-epidemique-quelques-concepts-simples/">Dynamique et contrôle épidémique : quelques concepts simples</a></h4>

<p>Dans ce texte, j’essaie d’expliquer quelques concepts simples concernant la dynamique et le contrôle d’une épidémie. Je l’écris bien sûr en pensant à l’épidémie de Covid-19, mais la plupart des concepts sont généraux. En préambule, je tiens à préciser que je ne suis ni médecin ni épidémiologiste, donc je ne parlerai pratiquement pas des aspects purement médicaux, ni de subtilités d’épidémiologie, mais simplement de quelques notions générales. Ma spécialité est la modélisation de phénomènes dynamiques en biologie, en l’occurrence en neurosciences. Merci donc aux collègues compétents d’apporter des précisions ou corrections éventuelles, ou des références pertinentes.</p>
<p><strong>Quelques remarques préliminaires sur les statistiques</strong></p>
<p>Avant de commencer les explications, je voudrais tout d’abord inviter le lecteur à la prudence quant à l’interprétation des statistiques, en particulier des statistiques de mortalité. A l’heure où j’écris ces lignes, on estime qu’environ 15% de la population française a été infectée. Autrement dit, l’épidémie est débutante. Les statistiques de mortalité ne sont donc pas un « bilan » de l’épidémie, mais des statistiques sur une épidémie en cours. Comparer avec le bilan d’épidémies passées, ou d’autres causes de mortalité, n’a donc pas beaucoup de sens (éventuellement, on pourrait multiplier par 5 ces statistiques pour avoir un ordre d’idée).</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie ne dépend pas que du virus. Elle dépend aussi de la personne malade. Un facteur majeur est l’âge, et il faut donc prendre cela en compte lorsque l’on compare des pays de démographies très différentes. En première approximation, le risque de décès de la Covid-19 augmente avec l’âge de la même manière que le risque de décès hors Covid. On peut voir cela comme le fait que les jeunes sont peu à risque, ou bien que toutes les classes d’âge voient leur risque de décès dans l’année augmenter d’un même facteur. Quoi qu’il en soit, avec ce type de profil de mortalité, l’âge moyen ou médian au décès n’est pas très informatif puisqu’il est le même avec et sans infection.</p>
<p>Troisièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie dépend aussi de la prise en charge. En l’occurrence, la Covid-19 se caractérise par un fort taux d’hospitalisation et de réanimation. La mortalité observée en France jusqu’à présent correspond à celle d’un système de soin qui n’est pas saturé. Naturellement, elle serait bien plus élevée si l’on ne pouvait pas procurer ces soins, c’est-à-dire si l’épidémie n’était pas contrôlée, et la mortalité se déplacerait également vers une population plus jeune.</p>
<p>Enfin, il va de soi que la gravité d’une maladie ne se réduit pas à sa mortalité. Une hospitalisation n’est généralement pas anodine, et les cas moins sévères peuvent avoir des séquelles à long terme.</p>
<p><strong>Le taux de reproduction</strong></p>
<p>Un virus est une entité qui peut se répliquer dans un hôte et se transmettre à d’autres hôtes. Contrairement à une bactérie qui est une cellule, un virus n’est pas à proprement parler un organisme, c’est-à-dire qu’il dépend totalement de l’hôte pour sa survie et sa reproduction. Par conséquent, pour comprendre la dynamique d’une épidémie virale, il faut s’intéresser au nombre d’hôtes infectés et à la transmission entre hôtes.</p>
<p>Un paramètre important est le <em>taux de reproduction </em>(R). C’est le nombre moyen de personnes qu’une personne infectée va contaminer. On voit que l’épidémie se développe si R&gt;1, et s’éteint si R&lt;1. A chaque transmission, le nombre de cas est multiplié par R. Ce taux de reproduction ne dit pas à quelle vitesse l’épidémie se développe, car cela dépend du temps d’incubation et de la période de contagiosité. C’est en fait un paramètre qui est surtout intéressant pour comprendre le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, si <em>R = 2</em>, alors on peut contrôler l’épidémie en divisant par deux le nombre de ses contacts.</p>
<p>Comme le nombre de cas est multiplié par un certain facteur à chaque épisode de contamination, une épidémie a typiquement une dynamique exponentielle, c’est-à-dire que c’est le nombre de chiffres qui augmente régulièrement. Cela prend autant de temps de passer de 10 à 100 cas que de 100 à 1000 cas, ou de 1000 à 10 000 cas. La dynamique est donc de nature explosive. C’est pourquoi la quantité à suivre avec attention n’est pas tant le nombre de cas que ce taux de reproduction : dès que R&gt;1, le nombre de cas peut rapidement exploser et il faut agir vite.</p>
<p>Naturellement, ce raisonnement suppose que la population n’a pas été déjà infectée. Si une proportion <em>p</em> de la population est immunisée (infectée ou vaccinée), alors chaque personne infectée va contaminer en moyenne un nombre de personnes <em>R</em> x (1-<em>p</em>). L’épidémie va donc s’arrêter quand ce nombre descend en-dessous de 1, c’est-à-dire <em>p &gt; 1- 1/R</em>. Par exemple, avec <em>R = 3</em>, l’épidémie s’arrête quand les 2/3 de population sont immunisés.</p>
<p>Ceci nous dit également l’impact de la vaccination en cours sur le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, à l’heure où j’écris ces lignes (22 février 2021), environ 2% de la population a été vaccinée (4% a reçu la première dose). Cela contribue donc à diminuer R de 2% (par exemple de 1.1 à 1.08). Il est donc clair que la vaccination n’aura pas d’effet important sur la dynamique globale avant plusieurs mois.</p>
<p>Il est important de comprendre que ce taux de reproduction n’est pas une caractéristique intrinsèque du virus. Il dépend du virus, mais également de l’hôte qui peut être plus ou moins contagieux (on a parlé par exemple des « superspreaders »), d’aspects comportementaux, de mesures de protection (par exemple les masques). Ce taux n’est donc pas forcément homogène dans une population. Par exemple, il est vraisemblable que le R soit supérieur chez les jeunes actifs que chez les personnes âgées.</p>
<p><strong>Peut-on isoler une partie de la population ?</strong></p>
<p>Est-il possible de préserver la population la plus fragile en l’isolant du reste de la population, sans contrôler l’épidémie ? Cette hypothèse a été formulée plusieurs fois, bien que <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230">très critiquée dans la littérature scientifique</a>.</p>
<p>On peut comprendre assez facilement que c’est une idée périlleuse. Isoler une partie de la population a un impact quasi nul sur le taux de reproduction R, et donc la dynamique de l’épidémie est inchangée. Il faut bien garder à l’esprit que contrôler une épidémie pour qu’elle s’éteigne suppose simplement de faire en sorte que R&lt;1, de façon à ce que le nombre de cas décroisse exponentiellement. Ainsi pendant le confinement strict de mars 2020, le taux était d’environ R = 0.7. C’est suffisant pour que l’épidémie s’éteigne, mais il n’en reste pas moins qu’une personne infectée continue à contaminer d’autres gens. Par conséquent, à moins de parvenir à isoler ces personnes fragiles beaucoup plus strictement que lors du premier confinement (ce qui semble douteux étant donné qu’il s’agit pour partie de personnes dépendantes), l’épidémie dans cette population va suivre l’épidémie dans la population générale, avec la même dynamique mais dans une version un peu atténuée. Autrement dit, il semble peu plausible que cette stratégie soit efficace.</p>
<p><strong>Les variants</strong></p>
<p>Un virus peut muter, c’est-à-dire que lorsqu’il se réplique dans un hôte, des erreurs sont introduites de sorte que les propriétés du virus changent. Cela peut avoir un impact sur les symptômes, ou sur la contagiosité. Naturellement, plus il y a d’hôtes infectés, plus il y a de variants, c’est donc un phénomène qui survient dans des épidémies non contrôlées.</p>
<p>Supposons que R = 2 et qu’un variant ait un taux R = 4. Alors à chaque transmission, le nombre de cas du variant relatif au virus original est multiplié par 2. Au bout de 10 transmissions, le variant représente 99.9% des cas. Ceci reste vrai si des mesures restrictives réduisent la transmission (par exemple R=2/3 et R=4/3). Après ces 10 transmissions, le R global est celui du variant. Par conséquent, c’est le nombre de cas et le R du variant plus contagieux qui déterminent le nombre de cas et la dynamique à moyen terme (c’est-à-dire quelques semaines). Le nombre de cas du virus original et même le nombre de cas globaux sont essentiellement insignifiants.</p>
<p>Cela signifie que l’on peut être dans une dynamique explosive alors même que le nombre de cas diminue. Pour savoir si l’épidémie est sous contrôle, il faut regarder le R du variant le plus contagieux. A l’heure où j’écris, on est précisément dans la situation où le virus original est encore dominant avec R&lt;1 et les variants ont un R&gt;1, ce qui signifie que malgré une diminution globale des cas, on est dans une dynamique explosive qui sera apparente dans le nombre global de cas lorsque les variants seront dominants.</p>
<p><strong>Le contrôle épidémique</strong></p>
<p>Contrôler l’épidémie signifie faire en sorte que R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas diminue exponentiellement et s’approche de 0. Il ne s’agit pas nécessairement de supprimer toute transmission mais de faire en sorte par une combinaison de mesures que R soit plus petit que 1. Ainsi, passer de R = 1.1 à 0.9 suffit pour passer d’une épidémie explosive à une extinction de l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Naturellement, la mesure la plus sûre pour éteindre l’épidémie est d’empêcher toute relation sociale (le « confinement »). Mais il existe potentiellement de nombreuses autres mesures, et idéalement il s’agit de combiner plusieurs mesures à la fois efficaces et peu contraignantes, le confinement pouvant être utilisé en dernier recours lorsque ces mesures ont échoué. La difficulté est que l’impact d’une mesure n’est pas précisément connu pour un virus nouveau.</p>
<p>Ces connaissances sont cependant loin d’être négligeables après un an d’épidémie de Covid-19. On sait par exemple que le port du masque est très efficace (on s’en doutait déjà, étant donné que c’est une infection respiratoire). On sait que le virus se propage par projection de gouttelettes et par aérosols. On sait également que les écoles et les lieux de restauration collective sont des lieux importants de contamination. Cette observation peut conduire à fermer ces lieux, mais on pourrait alternativement les sécuriser par l’installation de ventilation et de filtres (investissement qui pourrait d’ailleurs être synergique avec un plan de rénovation énergétique).</p>
<p>Il y a deux grands types de mesures. Il y a des mesures globales qui s’appliquent aux personnes saines comme aux porteurs du virus, comme le port du masque, la fermeture de certains lieux, la mise en place du télétravail. Le coût de ces mesures (au sens large, c’est-à-dire le coût économique et les contraintes) est fixe. Il y a des mesures spécifiques, c’est-à-dire qui sont déclenchées lorsqu’il y a un cas, comme le traçage, la fermeture d’une école, le confinement local. Ces mesures spécifiques ont un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Le coût global est donc une combinaison d’un coût fixe et d’un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Par conséquent, il est toujours plus coûteux de maîtriser une épidémie lorsque le nombre de cas est plus grand (choix qui semble pourtant avoir été fait en France après le deuxième confinement).</p>
<p><strong>Le « plateau »</strong></p>
<p>Une remarque importante : les mesures ont un impact sur la progression de l’épidémie (R) et non directement sur le nombre de cas. Cela signifie que si l’on sait maintenir un nombre de cas haut (R=1), alors on sait tout aussi bien (avec les mêmes mesures), maintenir un nombre de cas bas. Avec un petit effort supplémentaire (R=0.9), on peut supprimer l’épidémie.</p>
<p>Avoir comme objectif la saturation hospitalière n’a donc pas particulièrement d’intérêt, et est même un choix plus coûteux que la suppression. Il existe une justification à cet objectif, la stratégie consistant à « aplatir la courbe », qui a été suggérée au début de l’épidémie. Il s’agit de maximiser le nombre de personnes infectées de façon à immuniser rapidement toute la population. Maintenant qu’il existe un vaccin, cette stratégie n’a plus beaucoup de sens. Même sans vaccin, infecter toute la population sans saturer les services hospitaliers prendrait plusieurs années, sans parler naturellement de la mortalité.</p>
<p><strong>La suppression de l’épidémie</strong></p>
<p>Comme remarqué précédemment, il est plus facile de maîtriser une épidémie faible que forte, et donc une stratégie de contrôle doit viser non un nombre de cas « acceptables », mais un taux de reproduction R&lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas décroît exponentiellement. Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il faut prendre en compte les cas importés. C’est-à-dire que sur une période de contamination, le nombre de cas va passer non plus de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n</em> mais de <em>n</em> à <em>R</em> x <em>n + </em><em>I</em>, où <em>I</em> est le nombre de cas importés. Le nombre de cas va donc se stabiliser à <em>I/(1-R)</em> (par exemple, 3 fois le nombre de cas importés si R = 2/3). Si l’on veut diminuer encore le nombre de cas, il devient alors important d’empêcher l’importation de nouveaux cas (tests, quarantaine, etc).</p>
<p>Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il devient faisable d’appliquer des mesures spécifiques très poussées, c’est-à-dire pour chaque cas. Par exemple, pour chaque cas, on isole la personne, et l’on teste et on isole toutes les personnes susceptibles d’être également porteuses. Non seulement on identifie les personnes potentiellement contaminées par la personne positive, mais on recherche également la source de la contamination. En effet, si l’épidémie est portée par des événements de supercontamination (« clusters »), alors il devient plus efficace de remonter à la source de la contamination puis de suivre les cas contacts.</p>
<p>A faible circulation, comme on dispose de ces moyens supplémentaires pour diminuer la transmission, il devient possible de lever certains moyens non spécifiques (par exemple le confinement général ou autres restrictions sociales, les fermetures d’établissements et même le port du masque). Pour que les moyens spécifiques aient un impact important, un point clé est que la majorité des cas puissent être détectés. Cela suppose des tests systématiques massifs, par exemple en utilisant des tests salivaires, des drive-in, des tests groupés, des contrôles de température. Cela suppose que les personnes positives ne soient pas découragées de se tester et s’isoler (en particulier, en maintenant les revenus). Cela suppose également un isolement systématique en attente de résultat pour les cas suspectés. Autrement dit, pour avoir une chance de fonctionner, cette stratégie doit être appliquée de manière la plus systématique possible. L’appliquer sur 10% des cas n’a pratiquement aucun intérêt. C’est pourquoi elle n’a de sens que lorsque la circulation du virus est faible.</p>
<p>Il est important d’observer que dans cette stratégie, l’essentiel du coût et des contraintes est porté par le dispositif de test, puisque le traçage et l’isolement ne se produisent que lorsqu’un cas est détecté, ce qui idéalement arrive très rarement. Si elle demande une certaine logistique, c’est en revanche une stratégie économique et peu contraignante pour la population.</p>
<p><strong>Quand agir ?</strong></p>
<p>J’ai expliqué que maintenir un niveau élevé de cas est plus coûteux et plus contraignant que maintenir un niveau faible de cas. Maintenir un niveau très faible de cas est encore moins coûteux et contraignant, bien que cela demande plus d’organisation.</p>
<p>Bien entendu, pour passer d’un plateau haut à un plateau bas, il faut que l’épidémie décroisse, et donc transitoirement appliquer des mesures importantes. Si l’épidémie n’est pas contrôlée – et je rappelle que cela est le cas dès lors qu’un variant est en croissance (R&gt;1) même si le nombre global de cas décroît – ces mesures vont devoir être appliquées à un moment donné. Quand faut-il les appliquer ? Est-il plus avantageux d’attendre le plus possible avant de le faire ?</p>
<p>Ce n’est clairement jamais le cas, car plus on attend, plus le nombre de cas augmente et donc plus les mesures restrictives devront être appliquées longtemps avant d’atteindre l’objectif de circulation faible, où des mesures plus fines (traçage) pourront prendre le relais. Cela peut sembler contre-intuitif si le nombre de cas est en décroissance mais c’est pourtant bien le cas, parce que le nombre de cas à moyen terme ne dépend que du nombre de cas du variant le plus contagieux, et non du nombre de cas global. Donc, si le variant le plus contagieux est en expansion, attendre ne fait qu’allonger la durée des mesures restrictives.</p>
<p>De combien ? Supposons que le nombre de cas du virus (le variant le plus contagieux) double chaque semaine, et que les mesures restrictives divisent le nombre de cas par 2 en une semaine. Alors attendre une semaine avant de les appliquer allongent ces mesures d’une semaine (j’insiste : allongent, et non simplement décalent). Dans l’hypothèse (plus réaliste) où les mesures sont un peu moins efficaces, chaque semaine d’attente augmente la durée des mesures d’un peu plus d’une semaine.</p>
<p>Il est donc toujours préférable d’agir dès que R&gt;1, de façon à agir le moins longtemps possible, et non pas d’attendre que le nombre de cas augmente considérablement. La seule justification possible à l’attente pourrait être une vaccination massive qui laisserait espérer une décroissance de l’épidémie par l’immunisation, ce qui n’est manifestement pas le cas dans l’immédiat.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/7QLveB8Y9KA/">How can we increase adoption of open research practices?</a></h4>

<p>This blog was written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions for PLOS.</p>



<p><em>Researchers are satisfied with their ability to share their own research data but may struggle with accessing other researchers’ data – according to PLOS research </em><a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u"><strong><em>released as a preprint this week</em></strong></a><em>. Therefore, to increase data sharing in a findable and accessible way, PLOS will focus on better integrating existing data repositories and promoting their benefits rather than creating new solutions. We also call on the scholarly publishing industry to improve journal data sharing policies to better support researchers’ needs.</em></p>



<p>PLOS has long supported Open Science with our data sharing policy. Our authors are far more likely to provide information about publicly available data compared to <a href="https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/">journals with less stringent policies</a>. But best practice for data sharing – use of data repositories – is observed in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">less than 30% of PLOS publications</a>. To help us understand if there are opportunities for new solutions to help improve adoption of best practice, we built on previous research into the frequency of problems associated with sharing research data. We investigated the <em>importance</em> researchers attach to different tasks associated with data sharing, and researchers’ <em>satisfaction</em> with their ability to complete these tasks.</p>



<p>Through a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/what-are-your-priorities-for-data-sharing/">survey conducted in 2020</a>, which received 728 completed responses, we found that tasks relating to research impact, funder policy compliance, and credit had the highest importance scores. Tasks associated with funder, journal, and institutional policy compliance – including preparation of Data Management Plans (DMPs) – received high satisfaction scores from researchers, on average.</p>



<p>52% of respondents reuse research data but the average satisfaction score for obtaining data for reuse – such as accessing data from journal articles or making requests for data from other individuals – was relatively low. Tasks associated with sharing data were rated somewhat important and respondents were reasonably well satisfied with their ability to accomplish them.</p>



<p><img height="624" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yitlUEq3MxJm9SMFMulTwu9TcLufAw66cpmaVwjgUQigSJ_s_9HgWwNur3kEyjqicTZ1h9UXHhk7m36GJmZYkaHuPEKoNgwXzAUtFS-An0pA0_r5TXKnWiL496UgLwxuhtXRemuD" width="624" /></p>



<p><strong><em>Figure:</em></strong><em> When we plot mean importance and satisfaction score, respondents were on average satisfied with their ability to complete the majority of tasks associated with Data Preparation, Data Publishing and Reuse of their own data but dissatisfied with their ability to complete tasks associated with Reuse of other researchers’ data. Tasks associated with meeting policy requirements are both important and well satisfied.</em></p>



<p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>



<p>We presume that researchers are unlikely to seek <em>new </em>solutions to a problem or task that they are satisfied in their <em>ability </em>to accomplish. This implies there are few opportunities for new solutions to meet researcher needs for data sharing – at least in our cohort, which consisted mostly of PLOS authors. PLOS – and other publishers – can likely meet these needs for data sharing by working to seamlessly integrate existing solutions that reduce the effort involved in some tasks, and focusing on advocacy and education around the benefits of sharing data in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) manner. </p>



<p>The challenges that researchers have reusing data could be addressed in part by strengthening journal data sharing policies – such as only permitting “data available on request” when there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing, and improving the links between articles and supporting datasets. Generic “data available on request” statements in publications, which are not permitted under PLOS’s policies, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011784">usually mean data will not be available</a>.</p>



<p>While our research revealed a “negative result” with respect to new solution opportunities, the results are informative for how PLOS can best meet known researcher needs. This includes more closely partnering with established data repositories and improving the linking of research data and publications. These are important parts of our plans to support adoption of Open Science in 2021 and beyond.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Like countless other parents across the UK, I’m finding it pretty hard to maintain enthusiasm for my kids’ home-schooling lessons. Or muster it, for that matter. Yet we all know that when an instructor is enthusiastic, those sessions are more enjoyable — and we remember more. While this might be common knowledge, however, “the underlying mechanisms for the favourable effects of teacher enthusiasm are still largely unknown,” write Angelica Moè at the University of Padova, Italy, and her colleagues, in their <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12399?af=R">new paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Educational Psychology</em>. The team therefore set out to better understand its power. And in a series of studies, they explored the idea that attention is key — that a more enthusiastic delivery grabs pupils’ attention more, which improves their memory for the material.</p>



<span id="more-41419"></span>



<p>In an initial study, German children aged 8 to 12 listened to a trained instructor read two brief texts, one of which was a description of the characteristics of dragonflies, the other a story about a farmer. The instructor read with either low enthusiasm (a monotone voice, few or no body movements, fixed facial expression, eyes fixed on the text) or high enthusiasm (exuberant movements, excited and varied vocal delivery, shining eyes oriented towards the children, varied facial expressions). The team found that kids in the high enthusiasm condition not only reported enjoying both texts more — and smiled more — but were also spent more time looking at the instructor, suggesting they were more attentive.</p>



<p>Next, a total of 54 Italian pupils aged 9 to 11 underwent a very similar procedure, except that some had to complete a task that required their attention at the same time. (They had to spot and circle pictures of bells, which were among other small pictures on an A4 sheet). For the kids who were <em>not</em> given this extra task — i.e. those whose attention wasn’t already tied up — those in the high enthusiasm group showed better recall of the texts when questioned afterwards than those in the low enthusiasm group. However, the experimenter’s enthusiasm level had no impact on the bell-circlers’ recall, “thus showing that attention is among the underlying mechanisms explaining the positive effect of enthusiasm on recall,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>A final study using the same texts found that when a distracting task doesn’t require sustained attention — in this case, some kids were asked simply to touch corners of their desk in a clockwise direction, instead of circling bells — greater instructor enthusiasm did make for better later recall for the narrative text. This provides further evidence that an enthusiastic delivery style improves recall “<em>only when</em> a secondary task is not competing for the students’ attention”, the team writes.</p>



<p>So what are the implications of these findings? Some people — and some teachers — are naturally more enthusiastic than others. But it is possible to learn to be more demonstrative and engaging, both physically and verbally. So perhaps there’s a case for arguing that more naturally reserved teachers might be encouraged to consciously try to be more enthusiastic — but not necessarily all the time.</p>



<p>The results suggest that high enthusiasm is only important when the listeners aren’t simultaneously paying attention to something else. So while extra enthusiasm during a lecture could help students to enjoy the lecture more, pay more attention to the content and learn better, it would not help students engaged in a practical challenge, for example. “This is an important message for those who believe they should be enthusiastic at any cost, but who may suffer from a constant, effortful up-regulation of positive emotions,” the team notes. “Our results demonstrate that they may ‘economize’ their efforts of up-regulating their enthusiasm and do so only in situations where students are not engaged in tasks competing for their attention.”</p>



<p>Economise the efforts of up-regulation… Well, perhaps that’s something I can try at home.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12399?af=R">Displayed enthusiasm attracts attention and improves recall</a></p>

<p><strong>In a fascinating sleep study, researchers have managed to “talk” to people in lucid dreams. </strong>Dreamers were given simple yes/no questions or asked to do basic arithmetic, and had to respond by moving their eyes and facial muscles. Several participants were able to correctly answer the questions in their sleep. The researchers hope that this new method will ultimately improve our understanding of sleep and consciousness, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-do-people-have-lucid-dreams">writes Claire Cameron</a> at <em>Inverse</em>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>One year into lockdown, and it’s safe to say a lot of us are very, <em>very</em> bored. We’ve watched all the boxsets we can stomach, developed (and subsequently ditched) a long list of increasingly esoteric hobbies, and have quite probably exhausted every possible walking route within several miles of our home. Yet the boredom persists.</p>



<p>Lockdown is, for most of us, an unusually boredom-inducing situation to be in, unable as we are to engage in many of the outside activities we would usually pass the time with. But boredom itself is common: as Camus rather pessimistically put it, “the truth is that everyone is bored”.</p>



<p>So how do you deal with boredom? And does being bored even come with some benefits? Here’s the research on boredom, digested.</p>



<span id="more-41397"></span>



<p><strong>Don’t look at your phone</strong></p>



<p>The first thing many of us do when we feel even a twinge of boredom is reach for our phones, ready to endlessly scroll until we’re bored of that and switch to something else.</p>



<p>But one study suggests that, at least during working hours, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/16/looking-at-your-phone-at-work-might-make-you-even-more-bored/">smartphone use doesn’t actually do very much to relieve boredom</a>. While phone use increased as workers became more bored, it also worked the other way around: participants were <em>more</em> bored after using their smartphone than they were when they started.</p>



<p>It could be that the act of switching tasks from work to using a phone depletes our mental resources, and the reward of a sneaky look at your phone isn’t able to counteract the additional cognitive load. Or perhaps looking at your phone can underline the tedium of the task you’re trying to escape from. Either way, the results suggest that clinging to our phones might not be the way to relieve our boredom.</p>



<p><strong>Reframe the way you think about boredom</strong></p>



<p>Nobody really likes being bored. But thinking about boredom not as a chore but as an opportunity for introspection might make it easier to bear.</p>



<p>In 2016, Tim Lomas, from the University of East London, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/23/youre-not-bored-youre-meditating-on-finding-value-in-a-maligned-emotion/">purposefully made himself bored</a> while on a long haul flight, making minute-by-minute notes about what he was thinking and feeling over the course of an hour. Rather poetically, he described his thoughts “emerging unbidden like fish appearing in an ocean”, and was “intrigued by how slippery, elusive and strange the mind was, a fleeting dance of vague ephemera”. He concluded that if people “were to regard boredom as a meditative experience, it may no longer be appraised as negative; indeed it may no longer even be boring.” York University’s Professor John Eastwood has similarly <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/april-2015/exciting-side-boredom">argued</a> that boredom offers a chance to “discover the possibility and content of one’s desires”.</p>



<p>So with a bit of introspection, you could turn your boredom into something more meaningful.</p>



<p><strong>Do something creative</strong></p>



<p>In a 2014 study, Sandi Mann and Rebekah Cadman, both from the University of Central Lancashire, found that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073">boredom actually increased creativity</a>.</p>



<p>Participants were asked to either write something novel or do something undeniably tedious: copy numbers out of the telephone directory. All participants then completed a <em>creative</em> task, coming up with as many uses for two polystyrene cups as they possibly could. And those in the boring condition came up with far more uses than those in the non-boring condition.</p>



<p>So not only could indulging your creativity be a way out of boredom, boredom itself might also give your creativity a boost.</p>



<p><strong>Get nostalgic</strong></p>



<p>At the moment, a lot of us are probably feeling pretty nostalgic for a life before the pandemic. Could focusing on that nostalgia help our boredom, too?</p>



<p>In one 2013 paper published in <em>Emotion</em>, participants were first induced into high or low states of boredom by being asked to copy down either two or ten pieces of text about concrete mixtures. They then retrieved either a neutral or nostalgic memory. Those who were in high states of boredom before retrieving a nostalgic memory <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-30613-001">recorded feeling <em>more</em> nostalgic overall</a> than those who were in low states of boredom. A follow-up experiment also found that nostalgia can actually <em>counteract</em> the effects of boredom, creating a sense of meaning in people’s lives.</p>



<p>Boredom often comes with a sense of existential emptiness, so reestablishing yourself as a person with meaning and purpose could help — and the way to do that could be through meditating on meaningful past times.</p>



<p><strong>Let your mind wander</strong></p>



<p>Mind wandering isn’t always a positive activity, particularly if you’re trying (and failing) to get on with an important task: mind wandering has been linked to <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(11)00087-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661311000878%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">poorer reading comprehension</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FPBR.16.5.857">worse memory</a>, to use just two examples.</p>



<p>But, if you’re bored, it could offer some relief. According to one literature review, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-07203-001">mind wandering can make boring tasks feel shorter</a>, help us disengage from boring surroundings, and improve our moods while we’re doing something tedious. And as mind wandering has also been linked with increased creativity and problem-solving skills, there are other potential benefits too.</p>



<p><strong>Tackle it head on</strong></p>



<p>Schoolwork can be a serious cause of boredom — who doesn’t remember watching the clock tick slowly by as we sat in a class we hated? Luckily, this also makes school a good place to <em>study</em> boredom, and in 2011 one team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010001093">explored a variety of different ways of dealing with boredom</a>, focusing on avoidance (thinking or doing something unrelated to the boring situation) and “approach coping” (thinking or doing something that actively changes the boring situation itself).</p>



<p>The team grouped students’ responses to a boring maths lesson into three categories: “reappraisers” dealt with boredom by meditating on the value of mathematics and therefore changing their view of the situation; “criticizers” tried to act to improve the situation by suggesting changes to the teacher; and “evaders” tried to avoid boredom by occupying themselves with something else.</p>



<p>The reappraising group were the least bored overall, and also experienced the most positive outcomes when it came to emotions and motivation: they enjoyed maths more and experienced the lowest levels of anxiety. So, as Tim Lomas’ research also suggests, rethinking what boredom actually represents, rather than trying to avoid it altogether, might be the best way of ameliorating it long-term.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated <span class="caps">BOLD</span> signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, <a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neurolib-dev.github.io">neurolib</a> offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Death can be a powerful narrative tool. We sob over the demise of a beloved character, cheer at the comeuppance of our favourite villain, or sit at the edge of our seats, shocked at deaths we didn’t see coming. Red Wedding, anyone?</p>



<p>All deaths are not created equal, however, and in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0030222820981236">new study</a> Kaitlin Fitzgerald from the State University of New York and team look at what makes certain fictional deaths so memorable. The team reports that although we find some deaths <em>pleasurable</em> — the long-awaited downfall of an antagonist, for example — it’s those we find <em>meaningful</em> that truly stick with us in the long-term.</p>



<span id="more-41392"></span>



<p>Participants were first asked to think of a death scene from a narrative — film, TV, or other media. Those in the control condition then wrote about why the death they’d thought of was particularly memorable, while the other two groups were asked specifically to recall a death that was  particularly “meaningful” or “pleasurable” and write about why they found it to be that way.</p>



<p>After writing about the scene, participants categorised the genre of the narrative they’d chosen, and indicated which emotions they felt in response to the scene. They also rated the extent to which they appreciated the narrative (how meaningful, moving or thought provoking they found it) and enjoyed it (how fun or entertaining it was, and whether they’d had a good time engaging with it). Finally, participants categorised the character as a hero, villain, anti-hero or anti-villain, rated the morality of the character and how much they deserved their death, and indicated how much they liked the character.</p>



<p>The results showed that “meaningful” and “pleasurable” deaths in fiction differ in key ways. Participants who had recalled a meaningful death were more likely to <em>appreciate</em> the narratives than those in the pleasurable condition, who were more likely to <em>enjoy</em> them. Those in the meaningful condition were also more likely to pick narratives from dramas or tear-jerkers, while participants in the pleasurable condition were more likely to pick deaths from the action genre, or from horrors or thrillers. The death of characters seen as moral, as heroes, or as less deserving of death were also more likely to be picked by those in the meaningful condition.</p>



<p>The relationship between morality and appreciation could be explored further, however. While the results suggest that the deaths of immoral characters are generally considered less meaningful, what about those whose morality is somewhat more blurred? Co-author Matthew Grizzard <a href="https://news.osu.edu/in-fiction-we-remember-the-deaths-that-make-us-sad/">noted in an interview</a> that, though both could very reasonably be considered villains, <em>Blade Runner</em>’s Roy Batty and <em>Star Wars’</em> Darth Vader had come up several times as examples of meaningful deaths due to their redemption arcs. These moral grey areas could be explored further.</p>



<p>Overall, though, the study indicates that even when we’re watching a film or reading a book we can experience death as a meaningful and reflective experience. In particular, the team suggests that media deaths can help people process “disenfranchised” grief — grief for someone they don’t feel “allowed” to grieve for — with fictional characters acting as a conduit for repressed feelings. So while it might be fun when a schlocky Bond villain <a href="https://youtu.be/8JbGpHY0izA?t=48">falls from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge</a> or Samuel L. Jackson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz1J9PUcMQ0">gets eaten by a shark</a>, there are scores of other examples that speak to people on a level that goes far beyond entertainment, and that may even help them understand their own grief.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You rub off the panels on a scratch card and find that you’re the lucky winner of £100. If you could choose when the same thing should happen to a good friend, would you rather it was the same day as your win — or a different day? And what if we’re talking negative, rather than positive, experiences — when you’ve both been issued with parking tickets, say, or both suffered a bereavement?</p>



<p>Earlier work shows that we tend to prefer to get through a series of negative experiences as quickly as possible, while we like to space out multiple personal positive experiences, so as to receive the most pleasure from each joy. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620976421">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> finds that when we’re thinking about shared experiences, though, this doesn’t hold. The participants in this study preferred to experience both negative and positive events on the same day as a friend, rather than on different days — as long as those events weren’t powerfully emotional. Franklin Shaddy at the University of California, Los Angeles and his colleagues think we have this “preference for integration” because it increases our feelings of connection with others. This could have implications for how we arrange our lives during lockdown.</p>



<span id="more-41385"></span>



<p>In the first of five studies, the team found that the vast majority of a group of student participants wanted to receive a surprise friendly message (in this case from the head coach of UCLA’s basketball team) on the same day as a friend, rather than a different day. In a second study, the majority of 304 online participants said that they’d feel happier about winning a moderate amount of money on a lottery — or being issued with a tax demand for a similar amount — if a similar financial win or loss happened to a friend on the same day than if it happened on another day shortly before or afterwards.</p>



<p>In further studies, the researchers found that people preferred to “integrate” — or “coordinate” — an event such as receiving a first-class flight upgrade or missing a flight with someone whom they liked. But when it came to someone they didn’t like, they had no strong feelings about the timing of the event. The same was true for another group of participants who were asked to think of imaginary people who they were told had similar political beliefs to their own, or opposite beliefs. The team thinks that people like the idea of coordinating positive or negative experiences with friends (or people they think they would get on with) because they feel that this will boost their feelings of social connection with the other person.</p>



<p>However a final study found that there are limits to this preference for integration: we prefer more extreme wins — and especially losses (such as getting divorced or totalling a car) — not to happen at the same time to us as to a friend. The team interpret this as reflecting a limited human capacity to savour gains and buffer losses, with shared extreme losses being harder to handle.</p>



<p>There are other potential interpretations of the results, though. If you won money, might you worry that telling a friend could make them a little jealous, or even resentful or self-pitying — or might you even feel guilty about your own good luck? How much better it would be, then, for you both to win money on the same day. Also, we could be averse to experiencing strongly upsetting events on the same day as a friend simply because a friend who’s also suffering is less likely to be able to help us to cope with our own distress.</p>



<p>Still, there are potential practical implications of the finding that we prefer to share experience of pleasant events. “Past research has shown that people underestimate their enjoyment of, and thus hesitate to engage in, hedonic activities alone,” the team writes. That resistance might be overcome if we were to share a positive experience with someone else if not in space, at least in time. During lockdown, we can’t meet a group of friends to go for a walk in a pleasant spot near our home, for example — but a group of friends could arrange to go individually for a walk in different uplifting places at the same time, and hopefully benefit from the feeling of enhanced social connection that this could bring.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/sJv6yShHt28/">PLOS and Uppsala University Announce Publishing Deal</a></h4>

<p>Uppsala University and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year publishing agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). The Community Action Publishing (CAP) agreement enables Uppsala University researchers to publish fee-free in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> and<em> PLOS</em> <em>Biology. </em>The Flat fee agreement also allows them to publish in <em>PLOS ONE</em> and PLOS’ community journals<a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1">[1]</a>. These models shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be collaborating with Uppsala University, our first European flat fee customer, on two new models that allow Uppsala researchers to publish without APCs,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.  “As one of the most prestigious university’s in the world, Uppsala is well-positioned to further the cause of equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing and we are delighted to join with them on this effort.”</p>



<p>PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">here</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing">here.</a> PLOS’ Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with PLOS’ other five journals creating efficiency and reducing administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. Uppsala University and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.</p>



<p>The Uppsala University publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS, following other agreements with the University of California system, Big Ten Academic Alliance, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network among others.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though girls and boys do equally well on maths tests, the stereotype that girls aren’t as naturally able at maths — or as likely to be extremely smart — is adopted early; even 6-year-olds in the US endorse it. Of course, these stereotypes harm women in an educational setting and in their professional lives, point out the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99409-003">new study</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>. So it’s important to understand what gives rise to them. Eleanor Chestnut at Stanford University and her colleagues now report that one common and well-intentioned way of attempting to convey girls’ equality with boys actually backfires: saying that girls are “just as good” as boys at something leads the listener to conclude that boys are naturally better, and girls must work harder to equal them.</p>



<span id="more-41375"></span>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Earlier work has shown that we use the syntax of a sentence to make inferences about the relative status of objects and social groups. Typically, we view the thing or person that is being compared to as the more typical or superior reference example. So, if you were to read “Molly’s cake is as good as Jessica’s”, you’d be likely to infer that Jessica’s is the exemplar that Molly is striving to equal. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">“Girls are just as good at boys at maths” is something that family members, caregivers, teachers and public figures all say to try to promote gender equality, note the researchers. And in 2018, Chestnut and her colleague Ellen M Markman reported that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12637">adults who hear that statement infer that boys are more skilled at maths and have more natural ability</a>. Unfortunately, then, it seems to perpetuate the very stereotype that it seeks to counteract. In the new study, the team set out to discover whether stereotypes can not only be perpetuated but learned, based on syntax alone.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">First, the team studied 288 adults, who were recruited online. These participants read sentences that incorporated nonsense words for abilities or traits. The team found that people who read that girls are “as good as boys” at “thrupping”, say, or “trewting”, inferred more natural skill to the boys, and that girls had to work harder to be “trewtic”, and so on. When the boys were reported to be “as good as girls”, though, the <em>girls </em>were perceived to be superior — showing the influence of syntax in the participant’s judgements. When the sentence read, “Suppose someone tells you that boys and girls [or girls and boys] are equally good at thrupping”, and so on, neither gender was perceived to be naturally superior. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The team then ran a similar study with 337 children, aged 7 to 11, who were recruited from museums in the San Francisco Bay area. This time, the researchers used puppets (who said they wanted to tell the children about boys and girls on their planet) as well as written statements. And instead of using nonsense words, the researchers referred to activities that the children would understand but which the team didn’t think they’d have a strong pre-existing gender bias about — whistling, hopping on one foot, doing handstands and snapping.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">When these children were told that boys [or girls] are “as good as” girls [or boys] at one of these things, the children more likely to report that the gender in the reference position, at the end of the sentence, was naturally better, and would have to work less hard to be skilled at it. Also in line with the findings from adults, when the boys and girls on the alien planet were presented as being “equally as good” at an activity, the children didn’t view either gender as being naturally superior. The children’s age made no difference; they all made similar inferences.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">“We conclude that is critically important to consider how we frame equality when talking to children,” the researchers write. The work suggests that if a child does not already hold the stereotype that boys are better than girls at maths, or more likely to be extremely smart, hearing that girls are “as good as boys” in these spheres could actually teach it. Public figures, websites, statements on Twitter, and even psychological research articles readily equate girls’ abilities with boys’ or women’s with men’s, the team notes.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Their work suggests that presenting girls and boys, and men and women, as being “equally as good” at something is a far better strategy. “Until women and men are on equal syntactic footing, they will not be on equal social footing,” they conclude. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology/">What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?</a></h4>

<p>One way to think of culture is as a context in which we learn and develop. We share, live, perform, and experience culture through our participation in daily activities, customs, and routines with social others. Culture helps us make sense of our social worlds and shapes our actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, culture plays a role in the way we experience emotions, construct our self-concepts, and learn and problem-solve.</p><p>With increasing migration and the movement of people in the twenty-first century, many children in the US and worldwide are attending school in formal settings where cultural norms and practices at home may conflict with those children encounter at school. This experience places children in the position of having to navigate two different social worlds—home and school. One broad question we can explore is: “what role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences and academic success?” Let’s visit three specific areas: parental beliefs and socialization practices, teacher perceptions, and school curricula and children’s learning.</p><h2>Parental beliefs and socialization practices</h2><p>Parental expectations, beliefs, and attitudes about education shape children’s academic experiences. Many parents in diverse cultural communities view education as a path to future success. For example, as a group many Asian and Asian American children attain academic success. What role does culture play in these outcomes? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=l4wwBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Understanding+Taiwanese+children%E2%80%99s+play+via+constructing+and+reconstructing:+a+prospective+vision&amp;ots=s3ofAeiKoG&amp;sig=ocrn2krrERVpHnGg2WA_A4j09bI#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Taiwanese%20children%E2%80%99s%20play%20via%20constructing%20and%20reconstructing%3A%20a%20prospective%20vision&amp;f=false">Chang</a> notes that as a group, Chinese and Taiwanese parents place a high value on education. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590544000068">Kim and Park</a>  note the same is true for Korean parents. Parenting approaches in these communities highlight training and disciplining children, parent self-sacrifice, and devotion to children. Parents believe perseverance and hard work is the key to success and socialization practices reinforce these values and traits. These cultural practices help children internalize the values their parents place upon education and behaving according to social norms. Children acquire these values and are loyal, appreciative, and dedicated to their parents for their support and encouragement. In part, they attain academic success to honor their parents and the broader social groups to which they belong.</p><h2>Teacher perceptions</h2><p>Teachers play an important role in children’s academic success too. What practices work best to motivate children to do well at school? The answer depends upon numerous factors. For example, many teachers will be entrusted with educating children who may not share their cultural heritage. How might this cultural mismatch shape children’s school experiences and potential for academic success?</p><p>Most American school practices reflect dominant, mainstream American values, norms, and behavioral scripts. For most European American children who value independence and uniqueness, teacher praise and rewards can be highly motivating. However, for children who come from families that value humility and modesty, receiving praise in front of classmates might be an uncomfortable interaction.</p><p>Student engagement norms are another example. Many American teachers using a mainstream cultural lens, connect active student engagement with student attentiveness. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/331021">Yamamoto and Li</a>noted that for many Asian and Asian American students, knowing when to be quiet is a desirable skill which caregivers socialize their children to acquire. Teachers using mainstream, American cultural values and norms may perceive quiet students as disengaged and inattentive. These perceptions impact children’s motivation to learn and academic success.</p><h2>School curricula and children’s learning</h2><p>Dominant, mainstream American values tend to permeate curricular and teaching practices. Many American schools promote individual learning and problem-solving approaches rather than group or collaborative problem-solving strategies. The focus upon individualized learning connects to the cultural ideology of individualism and the independent self. These approaches promote the self as separate and unique from social others. Many European American children participate in cultural practices and routines that reinforce this worldview and values.</p><p>However, many Latinx and indigenous children participate in cultural practices and activities at home that value group and collaborative problem solving. These practices connect to the cultural ideology of collectivism and the interdependent self. At home children participate in practices and routines that emphasize the importance of the group, especially family. Thus, there is a disconnect between the approaches at home with the practices and routines the child encounters at school. Consequently, many of these children often have difficulty reaching their maximum potential in classrooms that promote individual problem-solving skills. Why does this happen and does this necessarily have be the outcome?</p><p>For many children from cultural heritages that promote collectivist values and an interdependent cultural model of the self, the cultural practices in which the child participates at home may conflict with those the child encounters at school. Often, teachers are unaware of these sources of conflict. However, this conflict between home and school does not need to impede students’ success or invalidate the child’s cultural heritage. One solution is for schools to meet students halfway and bridge the gap between the two contexts.</p><p>Two fine examples are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/resources/bridging-cultures-in-our-schools-new-approaches-that-work-knowledge-brief/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a> designed to assist immigrant and indigenous children in the US and the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351237109/chapters/10.4324/9781351237109-2">Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP)</a> designed to assist native Hawaiian children. Both programs highlight how helping teachers become more aware, respectful, accepting, and inclusive of all their students’ cultural values and goals shapes children’s motivation and academic success at school.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Numerous cultural forces connect to children’s school experiences and academic achievement. These include parental beliefs, socialization practices, and cultural worldviews. Cultural values, practices, and ways of learning at home both shape and connect to children’s formal school experiences. Educational initiatives such as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/project/bridging-cultures-project/">The Bridging Cultures Project</a>  and KEEP highlight the importance of cultural compatibility and connectedness in fostering children’s active engagement in school. Acknowledging and incorporating cultural knowledge, patterns, and ways of learning at home when they disconnect with those at school is one important way to ensure all children’s academic success.</p><p><em>Featured image: School children in India, by Richard Veit</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/what-role-does-culture-play-in-shaping-childrens-school-experiences/">What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/644350254/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/644350254/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/why-future-consciousness-detectors-should-look-for-brain-complexity/" rel="nofollow">Why future “consciousness detectors” should look for brain complexity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/03/turning-geology-into-archaeology-how-two-businessmen-changed-the-face-of-time/" rel="nofollow">Turning geology into archaeology: how two businessmen changed the face of time</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/darwins-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/" rel="nofollow">Darwin’s theory of agency: back to the future in evolutionary science?</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>This study extended these analyses to measles, a highly infectious disease causing outbreaks around the world, by comparing official data on measles in Europe to data from Google Trends.</p>
<p>The authors found that the prediction model generated from the Google Trends data overall closely matched the data on actual cases. The prediction was more accurate for countries that had higher measles activity. One advantage of using data from Google trends to track and predict disease outbreaks is that the data are available almost in real time, in contrast to official data that often take months to be released. This could help with faster responses to contain the spread of the illness.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12280 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_4564432-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heart condition common in people with diabetes, is caused in part by a lack of blood vessel growth and repair in heart tissue. Growth factor therapy can promote angiogenesis to treat DCM, but delivery of the therapy has proven difficult.</p>
<p>The authors of this study tested ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in rats with DCM as a potential safe and effective way to stimulate angiogenesis in the heart.</p>
<p>They found that UTMD used with Sonovue microbubbles restored heart function in the rats who received the treatment. Histology and microscopy showed that much of the damage to the heart tissue seen in the DCM rats had been reversed by the treatment. This new technique shows promise as a noninvasive therapy for early intervention of DCM in diabetic patients.</p>

A pre-specified analysis of the CONCEPTT trial</a></h3>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-12281 size-medium alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Fotolia_349804_Subscription_XL-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Babies born at either end of the birthweight bell curve are at higher risk of neonatal complications such as respiratory distress or NICU admission, but determining the cut-off precentile for considering a newborn at risk depends on a range of factors. Different standards account for these factors differently, leading to discrepancies in identifying babies at risk. Maternal diabetes is one of the factors that affect both a newborn’s birthweight and their risk of complications.</p>
<p>A new study has applied three widely-used growth standards to a large, international cohort of babies born to mothers with diabetes. Birthweight percentiles were calculated using each of the standards and then predicted risk of complications based on those percentiles was compared with actual outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that one of the growth standards, which did not account for gestational age at birth, was not suitable for risk assessment of babies born to mothers with diabetes, while the other two showed high associations between cut-offs for large- and small-for-gestational-age and rates of complications.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12282 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_141571612-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Falling is a serious risk for older adults, and falls-prevention exercise interventions have shown good results in preventing falls in the short-term. However, little is known about the long-term effects of these interventions and whether they produce ongoing changes in the exercise behaviors of the participants.</p>
<p>To fill in these gaps, the authors of this study interviewed older adults who had participated in a fall-prevention exercise trial about their experiences in the trial and their exercise activities and falls after the conclusion of the trial.</p>
<p>The participants described maintaining physical activity since the conclusion of the trial, but very few continued with the exercises they had learned in the intervention. Many of the participants minimized the seriousness of falls they had experienced. These interviews highlighted that the challenges in encouraging older adults to continue with falls-prevention exercises after the conclusion of an intervention are similar to the challenges in convincing them to participate in the interventions in the first place. Those working with older adults need to understand individual needs and habits and to contextualize the importance of fall prevention within each individual’s own priorities for maintaining health and independence.</p>

<blockquote><p>These clear guidelines will allow authors … to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta-ethnography, the synthesis of multiple qualitative studies, can provide insights into the experiences of patients and health-care professionals and generate evidence that can be used to inform healthcare practice and policy. However, there are not yet clear guidelines on the process of meta-ethnography.</p>
<p>To address this, the authors of a new paper have designed a step-by-step method for conducting a meta-ethnography, including examples. They especially focused on the middle and later stages of the process, “determining how the studies are related, translating the studies into one another, synthesising the translations,” due to the difficulty of these steps and the dearth of existing guidance for conducting them.</p>
<p>These clear guidelines will allow authors of future meta-ethnographies, even those new to the methodology, to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses of evidence that contribute to improvements in patient care and healthcare processes.</p>

<p>Subscribers to arXiv’s daily email announcement recently experienced a disruption in service. Maintenance performed by arXiv’s email provider was found to be the cause of the disruption. The issue has been resolved, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>During this time, functionality on arXiv.org remained intact. Readers and authors could continue to browse and download new papers on arXiv.org, as well as submit their own articles.</p>
<p><b>The issue</b></p>
<p>Daily emails announcing new papers were received late, or not at all. Other emails, such as account registration confirmations, were also affected.</p>
<p><b>The response</b></p>
<p>We first identified and fixed a problem related to the email disruption, and began sending the email backlog to subscribers. Soon after that process began, another issue was identified that inadvertently truncated subscriber lists, specific to several subject areas. Finally, the distribution lists for all subject areas were restored and remaining announcements were sent.</p>
<p>Moving forward, if any subscribers find that the daily announcement email is not received, we advise them <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">to resubscribe</a>.</p>
<p><b>Remediation </b></p>
<p>We know that researchers rely on the daily announcement for their work, and we aim to avoid such disruptions in the future by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automating daily backups of the distribution lists</li>
<li>Applying fixes to prevent the root cause</li>
<li>Improving the monitoring of the daily email announcement systems</li>
<li>Reviewing our overall backup and recovery plans</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we resolved the issue and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

<p><em>A message to the community from the Directors of the Institutes, Centers, and Offices involved in the NIH BRAIN Initiative and NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. </em></p>
<p><span id="more-3042"></span></p>
<p><em>NINDS Director Walter J. Koroshetz, NIMH Director Joshua A. Gordon, NIA Director Richard Hodes, NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, NICHD Director Diana W. Bianchi, NEI Director Michael F. Chiang, NIDCR Director Rena D’Souza, NIAAA Director George F. Koob, NCCIH Director Helene Langevin, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director John J. Ngai, OBSSR Director William T. Riley, NIBIB Director Bruce J. Tromberg, NIDCD Director Debara L. Tucci, NIEHS Director Rick Woychik, NINR Director Shannon N. Zenk</em></p>
<p>Inherent in the mission of NIH is that biomedical research and its application can and should benefit all people. Significant events across our nation over the past year and frank discussions in the research community have led to deep reflection at NIH about biases and disparities faced by underrepresented groups in the research enterprise. As we strive to recognize our own role in these challenges, we <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html">affirm our commitment to diversity</a> and to positive change to eliminate racism in our community and in our organization.</p>
<p>As a step towards that change, the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that are part of the <a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/">NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</a> and <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/">the NIH BRAIN Initiative</a>, strongly encourage the neuroscience community to take advantage of the new NIH-wide <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/first">Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program</a>, supported by the NIH Common Fund. Although progress has been made to increase participation of historically underrepresented groups in biomedical training stages, members of these groups are still less likely to be hired into positions as independently funded faculty researchers. These populations include underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women.</p>
<p>To help address this disparity, the FIRST program aims to enhance cultures of inclusive excellence through institutional support for recruitment of diverse “cohorts” of early-stage research faculty. Here, “inclusive excellence” describes the cultivation of scientific environments that can engage and benefit from a full range of talent. Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research. We want the FIRST program to enable researchers to thrive, and we believe the broader neuroscience community has much to gain. Indeed, the growing field of the <a href="https://diversity.nih.gov/find-read-learn/diversity-research-articles">Science of Diversity</a> shows the positive impacts that result when heterogeneous teams apply diverse perspectives and expertise to research challenges. We are hopeful that the cohort hiring model in FIRST will succeed in turning the culture in neuroscience departments and their institutions toward greater inclusion and diversity. We fully recognize that there are structural barriers perpetuated by gaps and that critical improvements must be made, because <a href="https://neuronline.sfn.org/diversity/fostering-diversity-and-inclusion-in-neuroscience-faculty">many groups are severely underrepresented in neuroscience</a>. To our neuroscientists: we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity as a path to meaningful change. We are committed to fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse neuroscience community, and the FIRST program is a step in the right direction, with many, many more steps to come.</p>
<p>The objectives of the FIRST program are twofold: to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-022.html">support institutions in hiring diverse cohort</a>s of early stage research faculty; and to transform culture at NIH-funded extramural institutions by building a community of scientists who are committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. In addition to funds for hiring, the program will support new and strengthened institution-wide approaches to facilitating the success of cohort members and future faculty from diverse backgrounds. For cohort members, this is likely to include mentoring, sponsorship, and networking opportunities. For institutions, this may include training faculty in approaches known to foster inclusive excellence and changing the rubric for interviewing processes. The FIRST program will also <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-023.html">fund a coordination and evaluation center</a>, which will develop and guide the collection of common data metrics to rigorously assess the effects of FIRST faculty cohorts and institutional activities on the research culture at funded institutions. Lessons learned by these institutions will be shared with the broader biomedical research community.</p>
<p>The FIRST program is expected to fund 12 awards over the next three years, plus the coordination and evaluation center, with an estimated budget of $241M over nine years, contingent upon the availability of funds. The first receipt date for the program’s funding opportunities is <strong>March 1, 2021. </strong>For more information, please also view the recent <a href="https://nci.rev.vbrick.com/#/events/a3aee724-a9e7-45fd-ba2d-bef6ca56de9f">technical assistance webinar</a>.</p>

Younger participants in particular didn’t show a strong preference for music from their youth. “This suggests that songs from our adolescence can become closely entangled with memories from our past even if we don’t personally value the music,” <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-were-obsessed-with-music-from-our-youth-154864">writes researcher Kelly Jakubowski</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>

<p>En hel dag, med några korta pauser, tog det att presentera grundpelare och huvudteman för det nya ramprogrammet för EU-forskning, Horisont Europa (#HorizonEurope). Presentationen arrangerades gemensamt av 6 stora svenska finansiärer; Energimyndigheten, FORMAS, Forte, Rymdstryrelsen, Vetenskapsrådet, och Vinnova. Många bra presentationer och panelsamtal! Jag har summerat det hela <a data-id="https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp" data-type="URL" href="https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp">i tweets här</a>, men det finns en del att lyfta upp som inte ryms i kortfattade meningar.</p>



<p>Öppen vetenskap nämndes EN gång (av John Tumpane, från FORMAS). Data-delning nämndes inte alls. Samverkan däremot nämndes upprepade gånger, framför allt med fokus på industrin. Standarder nämndes i förbifarten, framför allt som något viktigt för industrin att bevaka och delta i utvecklandet av.</p>



<p>Mycket av fokus låg på “partnerships”, arrangerade och finansierade strategiska multi-partssamarbeten som är menade att ge garanterad förutsägbar nytta. Hela 50% av budgeten går dit. Partnerships är inte nya för EU, men det utökade fokuset på nytta är en lite ändrad inriktning.</p>



<p>En nyhet för det här ramprogrammet är “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en">missions</a>“, övergripande målbilder som ska vara förankrade i samhällsbehov och ge samhällsnytta, och göra det lättare att nå målen för the European Green Deal och Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan såväl som hållbarhetsmålen.</p>



<p>Forskningsinfrastrukturer nämndes en hel del i början av samtalet (det är en av pelarna), och får en hyfsad andel av budgeten, men var inte särskilt närvarande när det kom till samverkans-diskussionen (där jag tycker de absolut passar in).</p>



<p>Regioner nämndes som möjliga innovationshubbar och koordinatorer, vilket var en trevlig ny vinkel – tidigare har jag mest hört regioner nämnas som trösklar och fragmentering, och ett problem för det svenska Life Science-ekosystemet.</p>



<p>Universitet nämndes i början – när vikten av rätt utbildning och mobilitet i utbildning diskuterades – men inte explicit i senare diskussioner om samverkan; där låg fokus mest på individuella forskare och på industrin. Universitet borde rimligen också vara nyckelmedlemmar i samverkansprojekt.</p>



<p>Två viktiga gap (”valleys of death”) i kunskapsöverföring och nyttogörande  nämndes: den slingrande vägen  som krävs för att ta forskning från labbet till industrin, och svårigheten att skala upp innovativa start-ups på ett hållbart sätt.</p>



<p>Regeringen håller på och arbetar ut en nationell strategi för Sveriges deltagande i Horisont Europa, det är dock ännu oklart exakt när den kommer vara klar. Det ska bli intressant att se vad den innehåller; EU-ansökningar anses allmänt vara tunga, arbetskrävande och komplicerade. Stödbidrag för att frigöra tid att sätta ihop en ansökan vore kanske användbart. Utökat stöd från universitetens administratörer och Grant Offices också. (När jag jobbade med mitt första EU-projekt hade vi en EU-kunnig administratör till hjälp, och vilken <em>skillnad</em> det gjorde). </p>



<p>Tydligen hade Norge sin motsvarande presentation <a data-id="https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0" data-type="URL" href="https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0">redan i höstas</a>.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a paper "Packaging Life: The Origin of Ion-Selective Channels".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Most articles dealing with early life focus on its chemical basis and the
evolution of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic products. This essay,
however, is concerned primarily with the energy required to produce and
maintain the essential life chemicals, and the necessity to confine them in a
cell where they can function cooperatively. It seems likely that life evolved
in proximity to the undersea vents discovered by the submersible craft Alvin
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (Woods Hole, MA). Bacteria were
probably the original life form, growing in mats near the vents. Some
advantages of the vents as starting points for life are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plentiful water and essential ions. We are ~60% salt water.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Plenty of chemical elements, many out of equilibrium and ready to
combine. From one point of view, chemistry is simply the search of
electrons, e.g., the two around a hydrogen molecule, for vacancies
as close as possible to a nucleus with many protons, e.g., oxygen,
or less avid electron gatherers, e.g., nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, or
phosphorus. Eighteen of the 20 AAs contain only hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; and the remaining two require sulfur in
addition. DNA and RNA require, in addition, phosphorus. In short, it
is not necessary to dip far into the periodic table to make most of
the life chemicals.</p>
<p>3. Energy can be derived from combining chemicals issuing from the vent, as
in a fuel cell, which derives energy by passing electrons from
hydrogen to oxygen.</p>
<p>4. The water near a vent is warm, speeding experiments in the evolution of
life chemicals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given these essentials, it is easy to imagine that life developed over a period
of time, say a billion years. J. D. Sutherland, who first succeeded in
synthesizing RNA, was quoted as saying: ‘‘My assumption is that we are here on
this planet as a fundamental consequence of organic chemistry.So it must be
chemistry that wants to work’’ (1). This essay starts at the point where early
chemistry has done its work. It deals with the packaging of the life chemicals,
the problems that arise from packaging, and energy production.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/RJi5ZkUCO8M/">Exploring code notebooks through community focused collaboration</a></h4>

<h6><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader</em>, PLOS’ Open Research Manager</h6>



<p>The lack of reproducibility of research findings is a continuing concern in modern science.  Code reproducibility is a central part of the problem and we have been exploring code notebooks as one potential solution. We need to understand if these are of value to our community, both readers and authors of computational research, and are asking the computational research community to <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey">share their views</a> on the most important aspects of sharing code.</p>



<h2>Collaborating on code </h2>



<p>We have been exploring opportunities for collaboration with community-focused tools, such as code notebooks, that can improve open, reproducible research practices. PLOS Computational Biology is investigating how we can improve the reproducibility of computational articles in collaboration with <a href="https://www.neurolibre.com/">NeuroLibre</a>, a Canadian-based open science group supported by the <a href="https://conp.ca/">Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a>. Code notebooks are documents that contain code, the dependencies needed to run the code and reader friendly text elements, such as paragraphs of text explaining the purpose of the code block and figure captions. These notebooks can be made interactive through the ability to change parameters in figures or edit the code itself.  Notebooks improve open science practices by removing barriers faced by researchers who try to access others’ code, such as setting up the correct environment to run the code, making it simpler to interrogate code underlying the figures in a paper by presenting the code, the resulting analyses and accompanying text in a browser-based notebook. The Computational Biology community is a  logical place to explore how valuable these are since the community already shows high engagement with making code accessible, although primarily via repositories<sup>1</sup>.</p>



<p>NeuroLibre has created prototype versions of code notebooks for two published PLOS Computational Biology articles. They took the code and data that were shared with the articles and turned them into browser-based notebooks that display the figures, with the ability to switch to view the code or to view a Jupyter notebook (hosted on <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>). While a base level of interactivity can be created without input from the papers’ authors, the NeuroLibre team worked with <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html">one of the papers</a>’ authors to create additional interactive figures. These extra features  allow readers to manipulate the underlying data in a different way thanks to author input, such as <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/03Code/Fig3_final.html">choosing intermediate sample sizes</a> as opposed to the three sample sizes detailed in the published paper.</p>

The sample size in the interactive plot can be changed using the dropdown box to the top left of the plot.</p>



<h2>What are we up to?</h2>



<p>Our collaboration with NeuroLibre to date has focused on gathering qualitative user feedback on the prototypes, to understand  the value of these notebooks to computational biology researchers. A series of seven initial interviews helped us to better understand how researchers currently manage and share their code, how and why they access other peoples’ code, and if we are asking the right questions about notebooks. Amongst other things, we are interested in hearing what aspects of publishing reproducible research researchers value the most, what challenges they encounter, and what considerations there are for creating an interactive notebook alongside a published paper. Informed by the outcomes of this initial research, we are now looking for more researchers to share their views on these prototypes via an online questionnaire. This will serve as useful feedback for NeuroLibre to continue improving their tools, and support PLOS in working towards improving reproducibility in research publishing, in collaboration with the scientific community. <br />If you work in computational biology related research, please <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey">share your views</a>! Anonymous results of the survey will be made available in the future.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/obese-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We have several anti-smoking policies in the UK in recent decades – the bans on indoor/workplace smoking, tobacco adverts around sports, and tobacco sales in vending machines, to name a few. Indeed, smoking has been the major target of public health interventions, and rightfully so given that it made the largest contribution to avoidable deaths. These public health interventions have been quite successful and, as a result, the number of smokers has been decreasing over the past 20 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, while smoking became less popular, we had more people with obesity. In 2003, 23% of people in England had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and the number rises to 29% in 2017. Similar trends can also be observed in other nations in the UK. With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.</p>
<p>We answered this question in our research by synthesizing two sets of numbers. The first set is the yearly proportions of people with different levels of obesity, and those of current, former, and never smokers. We extracted these numbers from the Health Surveys for England and Scottish Health Surveys. These surveys recruited random samples of people in England and Scotland, making their findings more representative.</p>
<p>The second set of numbers is what we called the risk ratios of obesity and smoking. Risk ratios quantify to which extent people with obesity and smokers are at higher risk of adverse health events, such as death. We extracted risk ratios from the latest meta-analysis studies, which should provide more robust estimates.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12249" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12249" height="250" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/picblog-300x250.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Frederick K Ho et. al BMC Public Health</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Combining these two sets of numbers, we found that smoking contributed 23% of all deaths in 2003, and that number decreased to 19% in 2017 (Figure). Meanwhile obesity contributed 18% deaths in 2003 and that number increased to 23% in 2017. The contribution of obesity exceeded that of smoking in 2013. The general trends were consistent across age, sex, and education level. But for younger people under 45 years of age, smoking remained the larger contributor to deaths.</p>
<p>It should, however, be noted that the analysis assumed the risk ratios could accurately reflect the extent to which obesity and smoking causes death over the 15 years. In addition, our study only considered deaths, but the impact of obesity and smoking extends to chronic illnesses and disabilities. The legacy of smoking, such as vaping, electronic cigarettes, and passive smoking, have also not been accounted for. These can be further investigated when better and more recent data are available.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking</p></blockquote>
<p>Historical efforts to protect the public from the harms of smoking have been successful. Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking, which highlights the need to focus our efforts to address it. This could include government policies and legislation to create an environment that can facilitate weight management, as well as interventions to support individuals.</p>

<p>I wrote a book!</p>



<p>As some of you may know, in summer of 2018 I signed a contract with <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/non-fiction/popular-science/">Bloomsbury Sigma</a> to write a book about my area of research: computational neuroscience. </p>



<p>Though the term has many definitions, computational neuroscience is mainly about applying mathematics to the study of the brain. The brain—a jumble of all different kinds of neurons interconnected in countless ways that somehow produce consciousness—has been described as “the most complex object in the known universe”. Physicists for centuries have turned to mathematics to properly explain some of the most seemingly simple processes in the universe—how objects fall, how water flows, how the planets move. Equations have proved crucial in these endeavors because they capture relationships and make precise predictions possible.<strong> How could we expect to understand the most complex object in the universe without turning to mathematics? </strong></p>



<p>The answer is we can’t, and that is why I wrote this book. While I’ve been studying and working in the field for over a decade, most people I encounter have no idea what “computational neuroscience” is or that it even exists. Yet a desire to understand how the brain works is a common and very human interest. I wrote this book to let people in on the ways in which the brain will ultimately be understood: through mathematical and computational theories.   </p>



<p>At the same time, I know that both mathematics and brain science are on their own intimidating topics to the average reader and may seem downright prohibitory when put together. That is why I’ve avoided (many) equations in the book and focused instead on the driving reasons why scientists have turned to mathematical modeling, what these models have taught us about the brain, and how some surprising interactions between biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers over centuries have laid the groundwork for the future of neuroscience.  </p>



<p>Each chapter of <em>Models of the Mind</em> covers a separate topic in neuroscience, starting from individual neurons themselves and building up to the different populations of neurons and brain regions that support memory, vision, movement and more. These chapters document the history of how mathematics has woven its way into biology and the exciting advances this collaboration has in store. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/U-E1ciB2N64/">Submit your Lab and Study Protocols to PLOS ONE!</a></h4>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em>’s array of publication options that push the boundaries of Open Science continues to expand. We’re happy to announce two new article types that improve reproducibility and transparency, and allow researchers to receive credit for their contributions to study design: <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/"><strong>Lab Protocols </strong>and <strong>Study Protocols</strong></a>. </p>



<p>These new article types complement other Open Science developments at <em>PLOS ONE</em>, such as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/01/submit-your-registered-report-to-plos-one/">Registered Reports</a>, and support PLOS’ mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine. Adding reliable and accessible methods that can be built upon to the scientific record, Lab and Study Protocols support robust, reproducible science.  As reproducible science helps accelerate discoveries, such contributions deserve notice. </p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Study Protocols</strong></h5>



<p>Consisting of a single article published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, Study Protocols describe detailed plans and proposals for research projects that have not yet generated results. Sharing a study’s design and analysis plan before the research is conducted improves research quality by reducing the potential for bias, and credits researchers for the work that occurs prior to data collection. Additionally, studies that were peer reviewed as part of the funding process can be eligible for expedited publication. </p>



<p>Already well-established in health-related fields, we’re opening the format to the natural sciences, medicine, and engineering, as well as the related social sciences and humanities. In fact, both Lab and Study Protocols are open to submissions within <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s inclusive <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information#loc-scope">scope</a>, and are subject to our normal <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">publication criteria</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Lab and Study Protocols from <em>PLOS ONE</em> provide new opportunities for researchers to gain more recognition for the work that goes into contributing detailed methods.</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplos.io%2FProtocolsIsHere&amp;text=Lab%20and%20Study%20Protocols%20from%20@PLOSONE%20provide%20new%20opportunities%20for%20researchers%20to%20gain%20more%20recognition%20for%20the%20work%20that%20goes%20into%20contributing%20detailed%20methods.&amp;hashtags=PLOSProtocols">Share on Twitter! </a></cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Lab Protocols</strong></h5>



<p>Developed with researchers and in partnership with the <a href="http://protocols.io">protocols.io</a> team, Lab Protocols consist of two interlinked components that together describe <em>verified</em>, reusable methods:</p>



<ol><li>A step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts. </li></ol><ol start="2"><li>A peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sample datasets and sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. </li></ol><p>This two-part setup provides the best of both worlds for authors: the detailed, step-by-step guidance is held on protocol.io’s flexible open access platform, and the article in <em>PLOS ONE </em>helps increase the visibility and discoverability of the protocol by making it an official part of the peer-reviewed publication record. The partnership with protocols.io supports authors by clearly communicating technical details in a user-friendly format to support reproducibility. </p>



<p>Access from the PLOS ONE article to protocols.io is seamless, via uniquely-created and clearly marked features of both platforms. The protocol and accompanying article are peer reviewed by subject experts. The method described in a Lab Protocol must have been shown to work in at least one peer-reviewed publication, so readers can be confident that the Lab Protocol will work as described.</p>



<p>Lab Protocols are now open to submissions reporting verified methodologies and computational techniques.</p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>What does it look like? </strong></h5>



<p>The protocol on protocols.io and the article on <em>PLOS ONE</em> work together to communicate details required to reproduce a study.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18683" height="1020" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/2021-02-08-14_57_29-PLOS-Protocols-PLOS-1024x1020.png" width="1024" /></figure><p>On the left is the protocol on protocols.io. With the details—steps—of the protocol portrayed through interactive features and special tools, authors can effectively communicate complicated lab instructions. On the right is the <em>PLOS ONE</em> article, providing context, assurance of peer review, and increased visibility for the protocol. Both elements of a Lab Protocol will be interlinked and available simultaneously, with peer review of both organised by <em>PLOS ONE</em> and its community of Academic Editors.</p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>Continuing to improve methods papers</strong></h5>



<p>Thanks to our partnership with protocols.io, we’re able to offer authors enhanced functionality to share their protocols alongside the features from a peer-reviewed publication. We believe that researchers will really benefit from the dynamic functionality that protocols.io provides, helping pave the way for improved methods papers and increased reproducibility across disciplines. </p>



<p>To help those who are trying protocols.io for the first time, authors of Lab Protocols at <em>PLOS ONE </em>can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols">upload and format their protocols</a> as part of the publication process in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

<p>Note: The Copyright Clearance Center issued the following press release on their<a href="https://www.copyright.com/plos-adopts-copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-to-manage-new-community-action-publishing-model/"> site </a>earlier today</p>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">The Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) announced today it is using <a href="http://www.copyright.com/publishers/rightslink-scientific/">RightsLink® for Scientific Communications</a> (RLSC) to manage its <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> (CAP) model, which aims to eliminate author APCs in order to make  its OA journals truly Open to Read and Open to Publish.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/"><em>PLOS Medicine</em></a> are the first PLOS journals live on RLSC, the comprehensive scholarly communications workflow solution from <a href="http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.</a> (CCC), a leader in advancing copyright, accelerating knowledge, and powering innovation.</p>



<p>RLSC is used by PLOS to deliver a flexible, sophisticated workflow that enables authors to easily publish OA, whether or not they are funded under a formal PLOS publishing agreement. PLOS can also leverage the agreement management capabilities of RLSC to support emerging OA models such as the University of California multi-payer model, where the university and author share responsibility for funding APCs.</p>



<p>“We want to ensure all authors have the same freedom in choosing the best venue for their research,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “PLOS’ Community Action Publishing changes the way we think about selectivity and authorship for a more equitable OA future. Key to this is a friction-free author experiences that reduces the lift for authors around managing payments. RLSC has been critical to facilitating this.”</p>



<p>“We’re so pleased PLOS chose RLSC to support its new CAP model by automating the management, collection, and funding of manuscripts,” said Emily Sheahan, Vice President and Managing Director, Information and Content Services, CCC.  “In partnering with PLOS on this important initiative, CCC helps provide the scale and automation required to support the needs of a growing community of stakeholders.”</p>



<p>PLOS recently entered into agreements with the <a href="https://www.btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/home">Canadian Research Knowledge Network</a>,  premier higher education consortiums of top-tier research institutions in North America, for its members to participate in the CAP program.</p>



<p>CCC just <a href="https://www.copyright.com/copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-increases-awareness-of-available-open-access-publication-funding-upon-manuscript-submission/">announced</a> new functionality for RLSC, including a capability to inform authors of available OA publication funding throughout the manuscript lifecycle, starting with submission.</p>



<p>RLSC enables publishers, funders and institutions to support a variety of OA agreements. It accelerates the implementation of OA deals, including Read and Publish Agreements, Membership Deals, and more. Over 30 publishers rely on CCC’s sophisticated agreement management solution to serve over 800 global academic institutions, consortia, and funders – including <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>, <a href="https://www.mpg.de/en">Max Planck</a> and <a href="https://cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a>. CCC’s <a href="http://www.copyright.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Open-Access-Workflow-Services_Service-Sheet_November-2020.pdf">Open Access Workflow Services</a>, a comprehensive consulting practice providing strategic OA institutional agreement workflow support, helps organizations deliver on each agreement’s unique needs.</p>



<p>CCC is an active partner in the information industry’s evolution of hybrid and pure Open Access publishing models. For years CCC has brought together key Open Access stakeholders from the author, publisher, institution, funding, and vendor communities through roundtables, panel events, webinars, podcasts, and published pieces. CCC is a member of <a href="https://oaspa.org/">OASPA</a> (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">ALPSP</a> (Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers), <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/">STM</a> (International Association of STM Publishers) and <a href="https://www.sspnet.org/">SSP</a> (Society for Scholarly Publishing).</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">Member institutions</a> now have <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage">a new way to view their arXiv usage data</a>. On arXiv.org, the number of downloads by institution is provided in searchable tables and graphs.</p>
<p>Universities, libraries, and research institutes want to support the platforms, tools, and resources that are most valuable to their constituents. By providing various types of <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage">usage statistics</a>, arXiv aims to help members and other stakeholders understand arXiv’s value, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_886" style="width: 974px;"><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage"><img alt="Screenshot of institutional downloads by subject area" class="wp-image-886 size-full" height="847" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/AccessDownloadStats-1.png" width="974" /></a>Institutions can now view their usage statistics this way. To search for a specific domain, hover over the area designated with the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>To download your institution’s data, you can select the institution or domain of interest, then click download, as indicated by the purple arrows in the screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_909" style="width: 945px;"><img alt="Screenshot of member downloads with arrows to download function" class="wp-image-909 size-full" height="386" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Member-Downloads-Tableau-Screen-Shot-2021-02-09.png" width="945" />To download the data, select the url or institution of interest, then click “download,” as indicated by the purple arrows in this screenshot.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>As our community knows, arXiv is open, above all. Readers can access articles without logging in. Authors need only meet minimal requirements to submit articles. This central tenet of openness makes measuring usage by specific communities challenging. The usage presented in the new format is compiled from data based on institutional domains and IP address ranges, and it does have limitations. For example, most people access arXiv from locations other than their research libraries. Providing new ways to view usage data is an ongoing process and feedback is always welcome at <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>arXiv’s 243 members and affiliates worldwide support the organization by contributing about 25% of the operating budget, fulfilling the Simons Foundation matching funds requirement, and contributing to governance through the Member Advisory Board. If your institution is a member, thank you! For organizations that are not yet members, we encourage you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">learn more about membership</a> and consider supporting arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>

It also thanks the donor organizations and institutional members that support our mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>
<p>This year’s report differs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports">past updates and reports</a> in that it combines the year in review and the budget into a single document. arXiv values transparency, and with this new format, we aim to keep the community well-informed about our activities. We hope you’ll take a look.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/calories-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nutrition labeling is an effective tool used by manufacturers and retailers to improve the public health, and its framework has been of importance to governments and policy makers. The front of pack nutrition labeling is part of United Kingdom government`s program of activities aiming to tackle diet-related diseases. There are several front of pack labeling formats available and they differ in the information they deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>Five hundred food products in five categories [(1) cereals and cereal products, (2) dairy products, (3) beverages, (4) packaged meats and meat products, and (5) pre-packaged fruits and vegetables] from three main United Kingdom retail websites were investigated. A simple random sampling method was used for product selection and, the types of the front of pack labels and levels of healthiness of the foods were assessed.</p>
<p><em>Dominant front of pack labeling formats in the UK</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12266" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12266" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-Word-300x218.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Daniel A. Ogundijo et. al. BMC Public Health</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The traffic light rating system (TLRS) and Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) are believed to provide at-a-glance nutrition information to consumers at the point of purchase and help consumers to choose food products based on their health and nutrition needs. The nutrition information displayed on the front of pack labels allowed food products to be grouped according to their levels of healthiness. The TLRS and GDA are the most common labeling formats that are used in the UK. As seen in the figure below, a combination of TLRS/GDA and TLRS/Health logos were dominant on the assessed food labels.</p>
<p><em>The levels of healthiness of foods in the UK retail market</em></p>
<p>The healthiness of foods was assessed by categorizing the food products into ‘healthier’, ’moderately healthy’ and ‘least healthy’ based on fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar contents. Red means the food is high in one of these and should be eaten less often or in smaller amounts. Amber means the food contains medium amount (neither high nor low) and may be eaten more frequently. Green indicates that the food is low in these nutrients and therefore is a healthier choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods</p></blockquote>
<p>We found out that a higher number of assessed products belonged to the “moderately healthy” and “healthier” categories than the “least healthy”. This could suggest that food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods. The imported foods that were found in the United Kingdom retail market also showed that healthier food choices could be made from the diverse food types around the world.</p>

Berlin, February 8th, 2021: Knowledge Unlatched (KU), the central platform for Open Access (OA) financing models, is pleased to announce the results of 2020 pledging round, which ended in December 2020 and once again saw hundreds of libraries worldwide pledge support for OA book and journal initiatives offered by KU and its partners.

Overall, about 310 books and 34 journals will be published OA in 2021. These include 240 books from the KU Select 2020 HSS Books Collection and 65 books from KU’s partner collections. In addition, 31 journals will be flipped to OA thanks to two ground-breaking Subscribe-to-Open (S2O) projects: Pluto Open Journals and IWAP Open Journals.

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is below:</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/">Brian Simulator</a> is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Animal-Shelter-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>How many of us love animals and think of our pets as part of the family? Well, what if I told you that among the 6-8 million animals that enter the rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million (i.e., 50% of the incoming animals) are euthanized. Even more heartbreaking is that 10% – 25% of them are put to death specifically because of shelter overcrowding each year.</p>
<p>The problem of overpopulation of domestic animals continues to rise, leaving shelters faced with the challenge of how to increase adoption rates. Though animal shelters provide incentives such as reduced adoption fees and sterilizing animals before adoption, only a quarter of total animals living in the shelter are adopted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the 6-8 million animals that enter rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million are euthanized</p></blockquote>
<p>These staggering statistics led us to investigate the length of stay of animals at shelters and the factors influencing the rate of animal adoption. The overarching goal of this study was to use these factors to predict and then minimize how long an animal will stay in a shelter, thereby decreasing the number of animals euthanized due to overcrowding. Several steps must be conducted to accomplish this goal, such as a literature search for the factors, collection of data from databases and animal shelters, and utilizing machine learning algorithms on this data to make predictions on length of stay in the shelters.</p>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-12273 size-medium" height="209" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/animal-rescue-300x209.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To answer the question of what factors influence the length of stay, a thorough literature review was conducted. Several factors were found to influence the length of stay including color, gender, breed, animal type, and age. To make the predictions about the length of stay using these factors, we evaluated using machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Machine learning is just the ability to program computers to learn and improve by itself using training experience. The developed system needs to analyze big data, quickly deliver accurate and repeatable results, and adapt to new data. A system can be trained to make accurate predictions by learning from examples of desired input-output data. In other words, we wanted to utilize a labeled data set with the output (length of stay) already known, so that the computer could learn from it. The next step was to obtain this data from databases and animal shelters across the country.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-12274 size-medium aligncenter" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Machine-learning-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>The data that was collected from the databases and animal shelters included information such as animal type, intake and outcome date, gender, color, breed, and intake and outcome status (behavior of animal entering the shelter and behavior of animal at outcome type). These data sets included information from mostly southern and southwestern states. For the length of stay, the categories included “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high” (euthanized).  Once the data was collected and cleaned, it was time to input it into the machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>There are so many different types of algorithms that can be used on a data set to make predictions. The hard part is determining which algorithm will perform the best on the given data set, as the performance of the models depends on the application. Simple classification algorithms such as logistic regression, artificial neural network, gradient boosting, and random forest were used in this study.</p>
<p>Examining the results, the most proficient predictive model was developed by the gradient boosting algorithm for this dataset, followed by the random forest algorithm. The logistic regression algorithm appeared to have the worst performance metrics for all categories of length of stay. What was interesting was that the gradient boosting and random forest algorithms performed well when predicting the very high length of stay or when the outcome was euthanization at around 70-80%.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12270" style="width: 522px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12270 size-full" height="333" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Blog_Shelters.png" width="512" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Age vs. Days in Shelter for Cats and Dogs</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Looking at the results from the exploratory data above, it was observed that the number of days a dog stays in the shelter decreases as the age increases. This was not expected, as it is predicted that the number of days in a shelter would be lower for younger dogs and puppies. This observation could be due to having more data points for younger dogs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Results showed that age, size, and color have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another interesting result from the study was the top features or factors from each machine learning algorithm. Results showed that age (senior, super senior, and puppy), size (large and small), and color (multicolor) have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.</p>
<p>For future studies, a prescriptive analytics approach will be utilized. Not only is our goal to increase adoption rates of pets in animal shelters, but to also determine the optimal animal shelter location where the animal will have the least amount stay in a shelter and most likely be adopted.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Damien Drix will talk about a paper "Rapid online learning and robust recall in a neuromorphic olfactory circuit".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We present a neural algorithm for the rapid online learning and identification
of odourant samples under noise, based on the architecture of the mammalian
olfactory bulb and implemented on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic system. As with
biological olfaction, the spike timing-based algorithm utilizes distributed,
event-driven computations and rapid (one shot) online learning. Spike
timing-dependent plasticity rules operate iteratively over sequential
gamma-frequency packets to construct odour representations from the activity of
chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind tunnel. Learned odourants then are
reliably identified despite strong destructive interference. Noise resistance
is further enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual priming. Lifelong
learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The algorithm is
applicable to any signal identification problem in which high-dimensional
signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.</p>

<p>We (INCF) have, as of this morning, officially applied to Google as a mentoring organization in 2021. This is our 11th time. We have a <a data-id="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing">Project Ideas list</a> of 55 projects from 27 mentor teams, a new record!</p>



<p>The next step is interacting with prospective students, and waiting for Google’s announcement of this year’s accepted mentor organizations (March 9). Since a few years back, we post all project ideas on our <a href="https://neurostars.org/c/gsoc/5">forum</a> to make it easier  for students and mentors to discuss.</p>

<p>Thick yarn makes for a quick knit. I am already finished with the Gunhild cardigan, a month before the agreed deadline. Slight stumbling block on the way; I ran out of main colour yarn after doing some modifications. And it wasn’t to be had anywhere in Europe, and out of stock at the supplier.</p>



<p>But I had bought some extra contrast color yarn, so I ended up doing half sleeves in the contrast color, and not just the edging. With extra long sleeves, which I like. And I sewed in a button so it would be wearable without a shawl pin for closure.</p>

<p class="ba b bb bc cd mt cc gl mu gn go bd"><img alt="Connected Papers Logo Image" class="alignright wp-image-878 size-medium" height="117" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Connected-Papers-logo-1-300x117.png" width="300" />A new feature on arXiv.org helps readers explore related academic papers directly from article abstract pages. Developed by <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/">Connected Papers</a> and now released as an <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration, the tool links to interactive visualizations of similar articles. Connected Papers graphs can help readers explore a visual overview of a new academic field, create a bibliography, discover the most relevant prior and derivative works of a paper, and more.</p>
<p>Readers will find the feature below an article abstract in the “Related Papers” tab, as shown below. By activating the Connected Papers toggle switch, readers can follow a link to the article’s graph displayed at Connected Papers. Each paper’s graph is created by analyzing tens of thousands of papers for similarity in their citations, and then a small subset of those analyzed are arranged according to their degree of similarity. Each node in the graph represents an article, which has its own set of connected papers.</p>
<p>“Connected Papers started as a weekend side project between friends, to solve our own problems with literature reviews,” said Eddie Smolyansky, co-founder of Connected Papers. “We can’t believe how quickly the scientific community embraced the tool and we’re so excited to be featured on arXiv – a website that we use daily in our own research. With this kind of support, we plan to keep improving Connected Papers and to build more tools for the academic community.”</p>
<p>arXivLabs is a framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations to bring innovative tools to the arXiv community, and <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">we welcome new proposals</a>.</p>
