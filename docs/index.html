              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis I finally launched. Here’s what it means for human spaceflight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fifty years ago, three NASA astronauts splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding the final Apollo mission. Less than a dozen years after President John F. Kennedy challenged the United States to commit itself to “landing a man on the moon and returning him safely back to the Earth,” that historic program had achieved its goals and ended.</p>



<p>Now, we’re going back. But this time will be different.</p>



<p>A pivotal moment for the return of crewed missions to the moon occurred at 1:47 a.m. EST on November 16, with the successful launch of Artemis I. NASA’s high-powered Space Launch System rocket roared and crackled as it lifted off the Florida coast on its maiden voyage. The rocket pushed the Orion capsule toward the moon, on a flight testing the technology that will eventually bring astronauts, both men and women, back to the lunar surface.</p>





<p>&#8220;It was just a spectacular launch,” says geologist Jose Hurtado of the University of Texas at El Paso, who works with NASA on mission simulations and programs to train astronauts in geology. “It really hits home to me what I love about space exploration, especially human exploration. It’s just an aspirational and inspirational spectacle, and I hope that everybody that was watching it got some of that inspiration.”</p>

<p>Now, the United States and China are leading the way to return humans to the moon. The two countries’ programs are massive and complex undertakings with potentially big payoffs. Both aim to boost scientific understanding about the moon and the early Earth, develop new technologies for space exploration and use on Earth, as well as set the stage for longer-term human space exploration.</p>



<h4>Better than rovers</h4>



<p>Apollo was “a technological program to serve political ends,” says space historian Teasel Muir-Harmony. It was rooted in the political tension and conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The program “was about winning the hearts and minds of the world public. It was a demonstration of world leadership … of the strength of democracy and then also of capitalism,” says Muir-Harmony, curator of the Apollo Spacecraft Collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>





<p>Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first-ever steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Over the next few years, 10 more American men hopped, skipped and even drove across the pewter-colored, lifeless terrain of our planet’s only natural companion. Apollo 17 was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/perfect-ending-final-apollo">final mission</a> in that series of landings, ending on December 14, 1972 (<em>SN: 12/23/72, p. 404</em>). Once Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison H. Schmitt left their footprints embossed in the lunar dust and joined Ronald Evans in the command module, humans stopped walking on the moon.</p>



<p>In the decades since Apollo 17, about two dozen spacecraft from various countries have visited the moon. Some have orbited, others have slammed into the surface so researchers could study the material in the debris of those collisions, and some have landed and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change-5-mission-moon-rocks-lunar-soil-sample">brought lunar samples back</a> to Earth (<em>SN: 1/16/21, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>While these uncrewed spacecraft have made some big strides in lunar exploration, humans could do better. “Nothing can replace the value of having a human brain and human eyes there on the scene,” Hurtado says. </p>

<h3>More to see</h3>



<p>Over the 3.5-year span of the Apollo missions, a dozen astronauts spent a total of 80.5 hours exploring the surface near the moon’s equator. “They explored only the tiniest fraction of the moon,” says planetary scientist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. Artemis crews will be checking out a new area: the south pole.</p>

<p>One moment during Apollo 17 makes his point. Schmitt, the only geologist to visit the moon, noticed a patch of lunar soil with a particular rusty hue. He walked over, contemplated the surroundings and realized it was evidence of a volcanic eruption. He and Cernan scooped up some of this orange soil for later Earth-based analyses, which revealed that the orange glass blobs in the soil did in fact form during a “fire fountain” explosion some 3.7 billion years ago.</p>



<p>That discovery supported the idea that the moon had hosted volcanoes in its youth, and additional analysis of the orange soil’s chemical composition hinted that the moon formed at around the same time as Earth. Scientists wouldn’t have had access to the orange soil if it wasn’t for Schmitt’s quick grasp that what he saw was important. “Probably the ultimate field tool is the well-trained human,” Hurtado says.</p>



<p>In his 2005 book, <em>Roving Mars</em>, planetary scientist Steven Squyres wrote: “The unfortunate truth is that most things our rovers can do in a perfect [Martian day], a human explorer on the scene could do in less than a minute.” Squyres, of Cornell University, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">led the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions to Mars</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 20</em>).</p>



<h4>A long-awaited lunar return</h4>



<p>Once Apollo ended, NASA shifted its focus to space stations to prepare for longer-term human spaceflight. Skylab launched in May 1973, hosting four crews of astronauts that year and the next. A few years later, the temporary station broke apart in the atmosphere, as planned. NASA’s next space station, the International Space Station, or ISS, was a larger, collaborative project that’s been hosting astronauts since November 2000. It’s still orbiting roughly 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>



<p>U.S. leaders have occasionally tried to shift NASA’s gaze from low Earth orbit, where the ISS flies, to a more distant frontier. Many presidents have proposed investments in different technology for different exploration goals and with different price tags. But by 2019, the plan was set: NASA would land humans on the moon’s south pole in 2024, though the timeline has since slipped.</p>



<p>“The first woman and the next man on the moon will both be American astronauts, launched by American rockets from American soil,” said Vice President Mike Pence in early 2019. Shortly after, NASA named this effort the Artemis program — after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.</p>



<p>The Artemis program is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars program, which aims to send humans farther into space than ever before. The moon is up first, with astronauts stepping on its surface as early as 2025. What the space agency and its partners learn during a few years of lunar exploration will help guide the phases beyond the moon, including sending astronauts to the Red Planet.</p>



<p>“The goal with Artemis is to build off everything we’ve done to this point and really start to establish a presence for humanity beyond low Earth orbit,” says planetary geologist Jacob Bleacher of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The first big test for Moon to Mars is to show that NASA’s rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, which has been in development for over a decade at a cost of more than $20 billion, can successfully launch a crew capsule, without the crew, beyond low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>But that effort has had a rocky start with the Artemis I launch scrubbed twice for fuel leaks and delayed by two hurricanes. Now that it&#8217;s off the ground, Artemis I <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">will test the SLS rocket and the Orion advanced crew capsule</a> on a roughly month-long trip beyond the moon and back (<em>SN: 8/26/22</em>). One more test flight, Artemis II, will follow a similar trajectory as the first mission, but with astronauts on board, launching no earlier than 2024.</p>



<p>Artemis III, slated for 2025, is expected to return boots to the moon and make history by landing the first woman on the lunar surface. On that flight, the SLS rocket will launch the Orion crew capsule toward the moon. When it arrives at lunar orbit, it will dock with the human landing system, currently in development by the company SpaceX. Two astronauts will board the SpaceX vehicle, which will bring them to the moon for a 6.5-day stay. That landing system will also bring the astronauts back to Orion, still in lunar orbit, which will then return them to Earth.</p>



<p>If all goes well, NASA plans to run Artemis missions roughly once a year. “We hope to, through those missions that follow Artemis III, build up some infrastructure,” Bleacher says. That infrastructure will include hardware for developing and distributing power on the moon, rovers for the astronauts to traverse long distances and eventually living and working quarters on the surface. The aim is to increase the astronauts’ length of stay from days to perhaps months.</p>



<p>To help support these lunar astronauts, NASA is leading the creation of a new space station. Called the Gateway, it will orbit the moon when complete, maybe by the 2030s. Like the International Space Station, which is scheduled to safely break apart in early 2031, Gateway will be an international and commercial research station. It will also serve as a way station for trips to Mars and beyond.</p>

<h4>The moon goddess</h4>



<p>NASA astronauts likely won’t be the only people exploring the lunar surface. China aims to land its own astronauts at the moon’s south pole by the next decade. Begun in 2004, China’s lunar exploration program, Chang’e — named after the Chinese goddess of the moon — has seen fast progress. It “is very systematic, very well done, and they’ve been successful every step of the way,” says planetary geologist James Head of Brown University in Providence, R.I.</p>



<p>In 2018, China put a relay communication satellite in orbit around the moon. In 2019, China landed a rover on the lunar farside, providing the first up-close view of the side of the moon hidden from Earth. That rover is still operating. In November 2020, China sent another rover, which brought samples from the moon’s nearside to Earth the following month.</p>



<p>Next up, although China doesn’t share its specific schedule plans, is Chang’e 6, which will collect and return material from the moon’s farside. In 2026, China intends to launch its Chang’e 7 mission to the south pole to search for water ice. “There’s no question,” Head says, “that [China] will be sending humans to the moon toward the end of the decade.”</p>



<p>China’s human-occupied space station, called Tiangong, is now complete and in low Earth orbit. And Mars exploration is on the menu as well. China landed a rover safely there in 2021 and is gearing up for a sample-return mission in the same time frame as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">NASA-European Space Agency sample-return mission</a> to Mars.</p>

<p>Science is an international endeavor, but NASA and China’s space agency <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-about-visit-uncharted-territory-moon">are unable to collaborate</a> due to the Wolf Amendment (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 14</em>). Tacked onto a U.S. appropriations bill in 2011, the amendment prohibits NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from collaborating, designing and planning projects with China, unless authorization is granted by the U.S. Congress.</p>



<p>Some lunar scientists, however, hope there can be collaboration between the two nations, such as sharing returned samples. “There are a lot of different places to go in space, and there’s no sense duplicating everything,” Head says.</p>



<p>While human space exploration began as a competition, international collaboration is now the norm. Astronauts from 20 countries have visited the International Space Station over its 22-year history, living together for months and working toward shared interests.</p>



<p>“The International Space Station is a frigging United Nations in orbit in a tin can,” Head says. Private firms also have become increasingly involved in the ISS. And for the Moon to Mars program, international space agencies and private companies are participating, designing and fabricating crucial components.</p>

<h4>To the south pole</h4>



<p>When humans step on the moon again, they’ll investigate a never-before-explored locale, the moon’s south pole. It’s a region rich with impact craters, uplifted ancient material and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-crash-reveals-crater-held-water">water ice</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/09</em>). Both the United States and China are targeting this area to answer new research questions and to access resources humans would need for an extended stay.</p>



<p>This cratered terrain reveals when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-took-multibillion-year-beating">rocky material tore through the&nbsp;solar&nbsp;system</a> in the first billion years of its history, slamming into the nascent planets (<em>SN: 4/25/12</em>). Earth no longer tells that history, but the moon, without liquid water or a robust atmosphere to smooth away the evidence<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-019-0622-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">, retains a surface record of meteorite impacts</a> over billions of years. “Because that record is so perfectly preserved on the lunar surface, it is the single best place in the entire solar system to understand the origin and early evolution of planets,” says planetary scientist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.</p>



<p>And while those are important mysteries, the south pole’s deep craters also hold something thrilling — water ice. There’s a lot to learn about that ice, says lunar exploration scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. How much is there? Can it be extracted? How to refine it for human use? The Artemis explorers can address those questions, which would enable even longer-term exploration.</p>



<p>That’s the goal this time around: to stay longer for both science exploration and to learn how humans can have a lasting presence on another celestial body. This work “would extend the bounds of human experience in a way that has never happened before,” the Smithsonian’s Muir-Harmony says.</p>



<p>That’s a tall order, considering how NASA’s schedules keep slipping and the cost estimates for each piece of Moon to Mars keep ballooning. A 2021 audit estimates that by the end of 2025, the cost for the Artemis program will reach $93 billion, some $25 billion over NASA estimates.</p>



<p>These next few years of Artemis flights will show what NASA can do. And China’s upcoming missions will show what that nation’s lunar exploration can achieve. The world will be watching both.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/11/15/laser-scanners-by-william-benner/">“Laser Scanners” by William Benner</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/williambennerjr?lang=en">William Benner</a> is a scanner enthusiast and the president of the company <a href="https://pangolin.com/">Pangolin</a>. His company sells equipment mostly for laser shows but also for other applications. Some years ago, he wrote a book on &#8220;Laser Scanners&#8221;, which is available through <a href="https://laserscanningbook.com/">this website</a> but can also be received as pdf via <a href="https://laserscanningbook.com/Register/">request</a> (or directly as <a href="http://download.pangolin.com/_Files/LASER_SCANNERS_Book-unlocked.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an interesting read also for microscope builders. The book is not too technical but offers inspiration or ideas also for more experienced scan system designers.</p>



<p>For example, the book covers the basics of different scan systems, ranging from galvo scanners, resonant scanners, acousto-optic scanners, MEMS scanners, and others. However, the main focus is on galvo scanners, how they are built, controlled, and what can be done with them.</p>



<p>One chapter that I found the most interesting (naturally, because of <a href="https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-5-1656">my own work on z-scanning</a>), is chapter 14, &#8220;Scanning in the third (focus) dimension&#8221;. The retroreflector approach is really cool!</p>



<p>The beam path designs shown in chapter 15, &#8220;Scanner blanking&#8221;, are quite inspiring, not only for blanking a beam but also for other applications. For example, one scan beam path designs from this book had been re-invented as the so-called <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGYork/status/1480400705026347008">scandreas</a> for light sheet microscopy.</p>



<p>Chapter 16 suggests<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens"> wide-angle</a> scan lenses, which made me think about the potential use of such a concept for microscopy, maybe together with scan devices that scan very fast but only at a tiny optical angle. It would be interesting to simulate and optimize such a beam path (and then probably understand all the reasons why it would not work for microscopy).</p>



<p>Anyway, check out the book. It&#8217;s a colorful mix of technical manual, advertisement for his own company and some pieces of entrepreneurial advice. There are some explanations that could be improved (for example the chapter on scan lenses), but that&#8217;s okay. The book is an easy to read, avoids jargon and describes some interesting ideas that I for example was not aware of before &#8211; useful!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/world-population-8-billion-humans-earth">The world population has now reached 8 billion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eight billion. That’s the number of humans estimated to be alive on Earth.</p>



<p>On November 15, the global population reached this landmark, according to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/dayof8billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a projection</a> from the United Nations.</p>



<p>In addition to being a cause for celebration, “the 8 billion milestone also brings important responsibilities, and highlights related challenges for social and economic development and environmental sustainability,” said Maria-Francesca Spatolisano, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for policy coordination and inter-agency affairs, at <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1q/k1qpc2kwlf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news conference</a> in July.</p>





<p>Though the global population continues to expand, the rate of growth is slowing. Current projections predict the world’s population will peak at about 10.4 billion in the 2080s and remain steady until 2100. Previously, the U.N. had predicted that the world’s population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, based on the rate of population growth in 2017.</p>



<p>In the coming decades, migration is expected to be the sole driver of population growth in high-income countries, according to the <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Population Prospects 2022 report</a>, released by the U.N. in July. What’s more, the populations of 61 countries are projected to decrease by 1 percent or more between now and 2050. In lower-income countries, population growth is expected to still be driven by more births than deaths.</p>

<h3>Population projections</h3>



<p>The global population is expected to peak at about 10.4 billion in the 2080s and then level off until the end of the century, according to these projections from the United Nations. The red line is the median of many projections (some shown in gray), each computed by varying factors such as fertility and mortality rates around the world.</p>

<p>“There is inherent uncertainty in population projections,” said John Wilmoth, director of the U.N. Population Division, at the July news conference. This uncertainty, he said, is in part due to the possible range of trajectories of birth rates, mortality rates and emigration across various countries.</p>



<p>While rapid population growth in developing nations may intensify climate disasters, Spatolisano said, it’s important to keep in mind that “more developed countries — whose per capita consumption of material resources is generally the highest — bear the greatest responsibility for implementing strategies to decouple human activity from environmental degradation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clam-presumed-extinct-found-alive">A clam presumed extinct for 40,000 years has been found alive</a></h4>

              
                <p>A species of clam is back from the dead.</p>



<p>Known as <em>Cymatioa cooki</em>, the clam had only ever been found as a fossil, and scientists presumed that the species had been extinct for more than 40,000 years. Then, while scouring tide pools for sea slugs off the coast of California in 2018, marine ecologist Jeff Goddard spotted something unfamiliar: a white, translucent bivalve roughly 11 millimeters in length.</p>



<p>Not wanting to disrupt the clam, Goddard, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, photographed it and shared the images with a colleague. Paul Valentich-Scott, curator of malacology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, didn’t recognize the marine critter either, which made him happy. “New discoveries are part of why we’re in science,” Valentich-Scott says.</p>

The minuscule clam is only about 11 millimeters in length.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119110">J. Goddard</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The pair finally captured a live specimen in 2019 and brought it back to the museum to compare with known species from the fossil record. It bore a striking resemblance to a fossil bivalve first described in the 1930s by paleontologist George Willett.</p>



<p>Willett named the species after Edna Cook, an amateur shell collector who recognized the fossil as being unique among a collection of more than 30,000 shells.</p>





<p>“Once I physically saw that original specimen that Willett had used for his description, I knew right away” that the live clam was the same species, Valentich-Scott says.</p>



<p>The researchers still puzzle over how the critters eluded science for so long. One idea is that <em>C. cooki</em>’s preferred habitat is farther south in Baja, Calif., perhaps in a remote area. A mass of warm water may have washed some clam larvae toward Santa Barbara. So far, Valentich-Scott and Goddard have found at least two, and potentially four, of the living clams.</p>



<p><a></a>“It’s rare to find something first as a fossil and then living,” says David Jablonski, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/95139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triumphant reappearance</a><em> </em>of <em>C.</em> <em>cooki</em>, described November 7 in <em>ZooKeys</em>, places the clam among a group of apparently back-from-the-dead creatures dubbed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/back-dead">the Lazarus taxa</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/07</em>). Even with the vast array of animal specimens available to modern scientists, Jablonski says, “there’s always more to find.”</p>

                <p>Written by Lindsay Morton</p>



<p></p>



<p>In scientific communications, methods are finally getting their due. Tools for better-communicating methods are everywhere these days&mdash;from new reporting standards and methods-specific article types, to dedicated methods journals and purpose-built repository platforms. But so far, no single solution has enjoyed wide adoption or been generally acknowledged as best practice.</p>



<p>Now, new data gathered by PLOS, with the support of <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> and <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>, sheds light on how researchers view methods, and lends insight into their motivations and behaviors when it comes to methods-sharing. Over 1,000 researchers completed the survey. Respondents were concentrated primarily in the Life and Health Sciences, and tended to be more senior in their careers. Read on for highlights, or skip straight to the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav">preprint for in-depth details</a>.</p>



<h3>Takeaway #1 &ndash; Established methods-sharing norms are insufficient</h3>



<p>Researchers report that, in general, for articles in their field, the information contained in research article methods sections is <strong>only moderately adequate</strong> for evaluating findings, and <strong>inadequate </strong>for reproduction and reuse. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Only 74% of respondents reported that the methods section alone is usually adequate to <strong>evaluate </strong>the findings of the article.</li><li>Only 42% reported that the methods section is usually adequate to <strong>reproduce </strong>results.</li><li>And 47% that it is usually adequate to <strong>reuse or extend</strong> the method in a different context.</li></ul>

<h3>Takeaway #2 &ndash; Researchers see methods sharing as important</h3>



<p>Researchers care about methods-sharing. Nearly all respondents (95%) rate sharing novel methods as important or highly important. A majority (60%) rate methods-sharing as important even if the methods themselves are straightforward and widely used.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-1024x445.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20948" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-1024x445.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-300x130.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-768x333.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Takeaway #3 &ndash; When it comes to their specific goals, researchers aren&rsquo;t satisfied</h3>



<p>Researchers were asked to rank specific reasons or goals for methods-sharing in two ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Importance of the goal</li><li>Satisfaction with their own ability to achieve the goal</li></ul>



<p>In general, goals relating to <strong>usability </strong>of methods are of <strong>paramount importance</strong> to researchers, and satisfaction with their ability to achieve this is moderate. Goals relating to <strong>access </strong>and availability are seen as <strong>slightly less important</strong>, but researchers also report a <strong>wider discrepancy</strong> between importance and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="891" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1024x891.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20964" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1024x891.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-300x261.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-768x668.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Takeaway #4 &ndash; The main blockers to methods-sharing are practical</h3>



<p>A minority of respondents (33%) report having prior experience sharing methods publicly, while 56% have shared methods privately upon request. Given the high value these researchers place on methods, and their assessment of the adequacy of research article methods sections in general, we have to wonder&mdash;what&rsquo;s stopping them from sharing more?</p>



<p>The major blockers to methods sharing are practical considerations. Over a third of respondents rate the time it takes to prepare methods for public consumption (40%) and not knowing where to share (34%) as significant or highly significant blockers.</p>



<p>Of slightly less significance are concerns that sharing may not be worth their time, either because few people would use the information (30%) or because others might lay claim to their ideas (30%). Few researchers (14%) express concern about exposing their research to scrutiny or criticism.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="585" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-1024x585.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20956" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-1024x585.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-300x171.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-768x439.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>What do we do with this information?</h2>



<p>Reflecting on the survey, Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> writes, &ldquo;This is the first method-focused survey that I am aware of. When we had the idea for <a href="http://protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> a decade ago, we were acting on our intuition. It is great to see the results of the survey, validating some of our core assumptions, but more importantly, illuminating some ideas that we should be considering and trying.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s our hope that this survey and others like it can help to identify unmet needs in scholarly communications, and ultimately lead to more effective tools and best practices. We also hope that interested meta-researchers will <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_A_survey_of_researchers_methods_sharing_practices_and_priorities/21334896">dig into the data</a>, draw their own conclusions, and help to direct future research in this area.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">New brain implants ‘read’ words directly from people’s thoughts</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN DIEGO</strong> — Scientists have devised ways to “read” words directly from brains. Brain implants can translate internal speech into external signals, permitting communication from people with paralysis or other diseases that steal their ability to talk or type.</p>



<p>New results from two studies, presented November 13 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, “provide additional evidence of the extraordinary potential” that brain implants have for restoring lost communication, says neuroscientist and neurocritical care physician Leigh Hochberg.</p>





<p>Some people who need help communicating can currently use devices that require small movements, such as eye gaze changes. Those tasks aren’t possible for everyone. So the new studies targeted internal speech, which requires a person to do nothing more than think.</p>



<p>“Our device predicts internal speech directly, allowing the patient to just focus on saying a word inside their head and transform it into text,” says Sarah Wandelt, a neuroscientist at Caltech. Internal speech “could be much simpler and more intuitive than requiring the patient to spell out words or mouth them.”</p>



<p>Neural signals associated with words are detected by electrodes implanted in the brain. The signals can then be translated into text, which can be made audible by computer programs that generate speech.</p>



<p>That approach is “really exciting, and reinforces the power of bringing together fundamental neuroscience, neuroengineering and machine learning approaches for the restoration of communication and mobility,” says Hochberg, of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and Brown University in Providence, R.I.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wandelt and colleagues could accurately predict which of eight words a person who was paralyzed below the neck was thinking. The man was bilingual, and <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10619/presentation/64105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers could detect both English and Spanish words</a>.</p>



<p>Electrodes picked up nerve cell signals in his posterior parietal cortex, a brain area involved in speech and hand movements. A brain implant there might eventually be used to control devices that can perform tasks usually done by a hand too, Wandelt says.</p>



<p>Another approach, led by neuroscientist Sean Metzger of the University of California, San Francisco and his colleagues, relied on spelling. The participant was a man called Pancho who hadn’t been able to speak for more than 15 years after a car accident and stroke. In the new study, Pancho didn’t use letters; instead, he attempted to silently say code words, such as “alpha” for A and “echo” for E.</p>





<p>By stringing these code letters into words, the man produced sentences such as “I do not want that” and “You have got to be kidding.” Each spelling session would end when the man attempted to squeeze his hand, thereby creating a movement-related neural signal that would stop the decoding. These results presented at the neuroscience meeting were also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33611-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> November 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>This system allowed Pancho to produce around seven words per minute. That’s faster than the roughly five words per minute his current communication device can make, but much slower than normal speech, typically about 150 words a minute. “That’s the speed we’d love to hit one day,” Metzger says.</p>



<p>To be useful, the current techniques will need to get faster and more accurate. It’s also unclear whether the technology will work for other people, perhaps with more profound speech disorders. “These are still early days for the technologies,” Hochberg says.</p>



<p>Progress will be possible only with the help of people who volunteer for the studies. “The field will continue to benefit from the incredible people who enroll in clinical trials,” says Hochberg, “as their participation is absolutely vital to the successful translation of these early findings into clinical utility.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-dandelion-seeds-spread-wide">Why dandelion seeds are so good at spreading widely</a></h4>

              
                <p>You don’t need a dandelion to know which way the wind blows. But it can help.</p>



<p>On any given dandelion, some seeds are destined to go north, while others are fated to fly east, south or west, and every direction in between. In effect, each dandelion seed <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/G06.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is programmed to release for a wind coming from one direction</a> and resists winds from other directions, according to research to be presented at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis on November 20.</p>



<p>Dandelion seeds are susceptible to different wind directions depending on where they are on the seed head, says Jena Shields, a biophysicist at Cornell University. The feathery seeds on the side facing a breeze will let go most easily; the others hold on tens to hundreds of times tighter — until the wind shifts.</p>

<p>It’s a phenomenon that Shields set out to study after her adviser noticed the way dandelions responded as his toddler played with the flowers.</p>



<p>Shields measured the force it takes to pluck dandelion seeds by supergluing a fine wire to the tufted ends and pulling them from the seed heads at various angles. This seed-by-seed study mimicked what happens when wind, or a child’s breath, pushes them over. Because each seed is most susceptible to winds from distinct directions, it helps prevent seeds from all going the same way, Shields says, and may explain why the plants are so successful at spreading. Once blown off a dandelion, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dandelion-seeds-create-bizarre-whirlpool-air-fly">umbrella-like tuft on a seed carries it</a> on the breeze that pulled it away (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But a strong, turbulent wind can still send all the seeds flying in the same direction,” Shields says, so the effect can’t guarantee that a powerful gust or exuberant child won’t blow off all the seeds at once.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/daylight-saving-time-sleep-health-science">Why daylight saving time just isn’t healthy, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Daylight saving time has ended, and most Americans have turned their clocks back an hour. My sixth-grader is in heaven.</p>



<p>At 6:50 a.m. these days, our once testy tween zombie is now … moderately awake and relatively lucid.</p>



<p>Instead of rising to gauzy predawn light, she’s got glowy morning sunshine beaming around her curtains. When she sets off for school, the sun has been up nearly a full hour. Just a 60-minute change has lightened both the morning and her mood. At breakfast today, I think I even spied a smile. </p>





<p>On November 6, every state in the United States except Hawaii and most of Arizona switched from daylight saving time, or DST, to standard time (those two states don’t observe DST). That switch shifted an hour of light from the evening to the morning. In March, we’ll move in the other direction when we “spring forward,” trading morning light for brighter evenings.</p>



<p>The United States’ biannual time change has been lighting up headlines since the U.S. Senate’s unanimous vote in March to make daylight saving time permanent. The Sunshine Protection Act would forgo turning clocks to and fro, repeating an unpopular experiment Congress tried in the 1970s and prioritizing evening light throughout the year. But the health case for staying on daylight saving time is pretty dim. And what such a shift could mean for adolescents is especially gloomy.</p>



<p>Even the name “daylight saving time” isn’t quite right, says Kenneth Wright, a sleep and circadian expert at the University of Colorado Boulder. There’s no change in the amount of daylight, he says. “What we’re doing is changing how we live relative to the sun.” When we move our clocks forward an hour, noon no longer represents when the sun is near its highest point in the sky. Suddenly, people’s schedules are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-sync-body-clock-causes-more-woes-sleepiness">solarly out of sync</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/16</em>).</p>



<p>That’s a big deal biologically, Wright says. Humans evolved with a daily cycle of light and dark. That sets the rhythms of our bodies, from when we sleep and wake to when hormones are released. Morning light, in particular, is a key wake-up signal. When we tinker with time, he says, “we’re essentially making the choice: Do we want to go with what we’ve evolved with, or do we want to alter that?”</p>



<p>From a health perspective, if he had to rank permanent daylight saving time, permanent standard time or our current practice of biannual clock changing, Wright says, “I think the answer is incredibly clear.” Permanent standard time is healthiest for humans, he says. In his view, permanent daylight saving time ranks last.</p>



<h4>Daylight saving time takes a toll on health</h4>





<p>Wright is not alone. As daylight saving time ticked toward its yearly end, sleep experts across the country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/daylight-saving-end-standard-time-permanent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped out in favor of standard time</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists have linked sleep loss, heart attacks and an increased risk of dying in the hospital after a stroke to the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsac236/6717940?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transition to daylight saving time</a>, neurologist Beth Malow wrote in <em>Sleep</em> in September. She <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Witness%20Testimony_Malow_CPC_2022.03.09.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified to that this year</a> before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee.</p>



<p>“My overall message was that permanent standard time was a healthier choice,” says Malow, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>



<p>For both Malow and Wright, some of the most compelling studies examine U.S. time zone borders. Living on the late sunset side of a border <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629618309718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes a toll on people’s health and sleep</a> compared with those living on the early sunset side, scientists suggested in 2019. A similar study in 2018 also found <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/27/7/719/71551/Circadian-Misalignment-and-Hepatocellular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increased risk of liver cancer</a> the farther west people lived within a time zone, where the sun rises and sets later in the day.</p>



<p>But the downsides of nighttime light are not always crystal clear. A November study, for example, suggested that year-round daylight saving time would reduce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deer-vehicle-collisions-daylight-saving-time">deer-vehicle collisions</a> <em>(SN: 11/2/22)</em>. But studies like these can be hard to interpret, Malow says. Other factors may come into play, like deer’s seasonal activity and changing roadway conditions. “The car-crash literature has been so mixed,” she says. “I’ve seen stuff come out on both sides.”</p>



<p>She points to a study in <em>Time &amp; Society</em> in June which found that people on the western edge of a time zone had <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961463X221104675?journalCode=tasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more automobile fatalities</a> than their easterly neighbors. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dark mornings and light evenings mean people’s body clocks don’t line up with the sun. That mismatch can hamper sleep, making for drowsy drivers, which may factor into collisions, Malow says. In the evenings, if “there’s still light in the sky, it messes with our brains.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A sleep doctor’s tips for getting more Zs</h3>



<p>For anyone struggling with sleep — whether during standard time or daylight saving time — Sonal Malhotra of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston has a few suggestions for ways to get a more restful night.</p>



<ul><li>Try to wake up to morning sunshine.</li><li>Keep a consistent sleep schedule, waking up and going to bed around the same time every day (even on weekends).</li><li>Keep a consistent meal and exercise schedule.</li><li>Avoid afternoon naps.</li><li>Avoid afternoon caffeine.</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>Morning light wakes up the brain</h4>



<p>The brains of teens and tweens are even more vulnerable, Malow says. When kids go through puberty, the brain waits an hour or two longer to release melatonin, the “hormone of darkness,” which tells the bodies of kids and adults alike that it’s time to go to sleep.</p>



<p>Bedtime can be tough for older kids because, physiologically, they’re just not as sleepy as they used to be. And as I’ve learned with my daughter, if you throw early school start times in the mix, rising and shining can be even harder.</p>



<p>“I have a middle schooler, too. It’s brutal,” says Lisa Meltzer, a pediatric sleep psychologist at National Jewish Health in Denver. Some U.S. school districts are making changes that might make mornings easier. This year, most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/us/california-later-school-start-times.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high schools and middle schools in California debuted later start times</a>. Five years ago, Meltzer’s school district embarked on a similar experiment. What they learned can teach us how older kids might fare if daylight saving time were to stay put year-round, Meltzer says.</p>



<p>In 2017, the Cherry Creek School District in suburban Denver flipped middle and high schools’ early start times with elementary schools’ later ones. The change didn’t much affect younger kids, who still started class well after sunrise, at 8 a.m., says Meltzer, who presented the science behind changing school start times to her school board. But older kids, who started school at 8:20 a.m. or 8:50 a.m., noticed a big difference. They slept more at night and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945722000053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to function better during the day</a>, Meltzer’s team reported most recently in the February <em>Sleep Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>“The number one thing [high-schoolers] said was how much they liked going to school when it was light out,” she says.</p>



<p>And it wasn’t just the students. Their teachers, too, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josh.13254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt the benefits of later start times</a>, Meltzer and colleagues report November 6 in the <em>Journal of School Health</em>.</p>



<p>Morning light is crucial for keeping people’s bodies on schedule, Meltzer says. With permanent daylight saving time, kids will not have the same eye-opening, brain-wakening, a.m. sunshine. “We need morning sunlight to keep our internal clocks on track,” she says. “I cannot emphasize this enough.”</p>



<p>So far, the Senate’s plan for year-round daylight saving time has seemed to stall, so the prospect of an everlasting shift toward evening light doesn’t look bright. But come March, when daylight saving time begins anew, we’ll have to adjust again.</p>



<p>For kids struggling with sleep, Sonal Malhotra, a pediatric pulmonologist and sleep doctor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, has some tips. Consistency is key, she says: regular sleep, meal and exercise schedules. And when waking up, she adds, “make sure you have bright light.” Malhotra also recommends avoiding afternoon naps and caffeine.</p>



<p>I don’t know if my daughter will ever be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in the mornings (I’m not), but when mornings eventually get darker, Malhotra’s advice may give us something to fall back on.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-why-covid-19-hits-differently">DNA is providing new clues to why COVID-19 hits people differently</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the mercurial nature of the coronavirus has been on display. Some people get mild, cold-like illnesses or even have no symptoms when infected, while other people become severely ill and may die from COVID-19.</p>



<p>What determines that fate is complicated and somewhat mysterious. Researchers are looking at a wide variety of factors that may play a role — everything from demographics to preexisting conditions to vaccination status and even genetic clues.</p>





<p>Researchers know that older people are more likely to have severe complications of the disease. The unvaccinated, too, have an increased risk of hospitalization and death compared with people who have gotten their COVID shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unvaccinated people age 50 and older were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 times as likely to die</a> from COVID-19 as vaccinated people who had gotten two or more booster shots, August data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate. For instance, among the unvaccinated there were 5.46 deaths per 100,000 people on August 28, compared with 0.49 per 100,000 for those with two-plus boosters.</p>



<p>Even among the vaxxed the number of shots counts. That same month, people 50 and older who got their first two shots and only one booster were nearly three times as likely to die (1.27 deaths per 100,000) as their peers who got two or more boosters.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Preexisting health problems</h4>



<p>A litany of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#underlying-med-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health conditions</a>, including heart disease, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes and obesity, increase the risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19 at any age. Yet some types of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-asthma-allergic-immune-response">asthma may protect </a>against the disease (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. But even among cancer patients, some people are more vulnerable than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2797979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cancer patients who are immunosuppressed</a>, either because of problems with their immune systems or because they are taking immune-dampening drugs, are more likely to get severe COVID-19, die or develop cytokine storm — a whirlwind of immune chemicals that can set off tissue- and organ-damaging inflammation, researchers report November 3 in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>. The effect was worse for immunosuppressed people who were getting immunotherapy for cancer, compared with people getting other chemotherapies or no treatment.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That means cancer patients with weakened immune systems “should be very careful and adopt strict measures to prevent them from catching COVID-19,” says study coauthor Chris Labaki, a cancer researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p>



<p>“Wear masks as much as possible, clean everything, including washing your hands. Maybe don’t go to crowded public places where the chance of catching COVID-19 might be higher.” People who have cancer patients in their lives may also want to take more care to avoid the coronavirus, he says.</p>



<h4>Genetic clues</h4>



<p>But young and otherwise healthy people may get really sick, be hospitalized or even die from COVID-19 too. It’s hard to predict who might succumb, but researchers are searching for genetic clues.</p>



<p>Some studies have found that versions of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-some-neandertal-genes-protection-severe-covid-19"> genes inherited from Neandertals may protect against COVID-19</a>, while other genetic heirlooms passed down from Neandertals can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-neandertal-genes-risk-severe-infection"> up the risk of severe disease</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21; SN: 10/2/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A massive international study examining DNA from more than 28,000 COVID-19 patients and almost 600,000 people who hadn’t been infected (to the best of their knowledge) confirmed that inheritance from Neandertals is involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.</p>



<p>The study also confirmed a previous finding that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-how-dna-genetic-risk-infection-severe-illness">people with type O blood may have some protection against getting infected</a> with the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/8/21</em>). Exactly what accounts for the protection is still not known.</p>



<p>People with rare variants in a gene called toll-like receptor 7, or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010367" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TLR7</em>, are 5.3 times more likely to get severe COVID-19</a> than those who don’t have the variants, the team also reported November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. Biologically, the link makes sense. <em>TLR7</em>’s protein is involved in signaling the immune system that a virus has invaded. Part of its duties include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">marshaling interferons</a>, immune system chemicals that are some of the first responders to viral infections (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Interferons warn cells to raise their antiviral defenses and help to kill infected cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A gene called <em>TYK2</em> is involved in producing some interferons. Genetic variants in that gene raise the risk of developing lupus, but may<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010253" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> protect against coronavirus infection</a>, researchers report in a separate study also published November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. While riling up interferons may fend off the coronavirus, when there is no virus to combat, the immune system may damage the body with friendly fire, producing lupus or other autoimmune diseases. Such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-death-immunity-gene-crohns-disease-health">genetic trade-offs</a> are common (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence links many other genes to COVID-19 outcomes, multiple large studies have found. Some of those findings may hint at drugs that could better treat the disease.</p>



<h4>Individual risk</h4>



<p>But the problem with all of these studies is that they can’t tell any individual what their chances are of a bad outcome from catching COVID-19. For instance, the DNA testing company 23andMe tells me that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-dna-genome">I have less than 2 percent Neandertal DNA</a> (<em>SN: 5/22/18</em>). I don’t know whether that includes the variants that would make me more susceptible to severe disease or the ones that protect against infection. What if I got both? And how does that play with my blood type and all the other genetic variants I may carry?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you have to factor in your age, your health, your environment. Let’s face it, that last one is probably the most important. For instance, if you have a job that exposes you to multiple people, you’re at higher risk of getting COVID-19 than someone who works from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s nothing you can do about the genetic hand you’re dealt (at least not until gene editing is perfected). Many experts I talk to say that improving indoor air in public buildings is what is really needed to avoid infection. That’s also out of most people’s hands. But there are still things you can do to lessen your risk. Labaki’s advice to cancer patients — mask, avoid crowds, wash your hands — plus staying up-to-date on vaccinations is good for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stonehenge: A calendar or just a crematorium </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/stonehenge-calendar-or-just-crematorium"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 11, 1972</p>



<p>The monument consisted of a circle of immense, finely tooled stone archways surrounded by a range of 56 equally spaced [holes].… The precisely proportioned placement of the stones and holes has led archaeologists to presume that the monument had some great astrological significance.… As an alternate explanation, the researchers say perhaps there were 56 families, clans or social units who built Stonehenge and who were entitled to dig one of the [holes] and use it to inter cremated remains.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Stonehenge’s purpose remains murky, but the monument’s origin is becoming clearer thanks to science. For at least the first 500 years of its existence, Stonehenge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/domain-dead">was a cemetery</a> (<em>SN: 5/29/08</em>). A chemical analysis of remains at the site suggests that some of the people interred there <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cremated-remains-reveal-hints-who-buried-stonehenge">came from Wales</a>, more than 200 kilometers west of where Stonehenge stands in southern England (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>). The monument&#8217;s first building blocks also may have come from Wales, repurposed from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stonehenge-roots-wales-stone-circle-archaeology">a stone circle</a> there, but that hypothesis is debated (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-ocean-fish-population-recovery-extinction">Sharks face rising odds of extinction even as other big fish populations recover</a></h4>

              
                <p>After decades of population declines, the future is looking brighter for several tuna and billfish species, such as southern bluefin tuna, black marlins and swordfish, thanks to years of successful fisheries management and conservation actions. But some sharks that live in these fishes’ open water habitats are still in trouble, new research suggests.</p>



<p>These sharks, including oceanic whitetips and porbeagles, are often caught by accident within tuna and billfish fisheries. And a lack of dedicated management of these species has meant <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add0342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their chances of extinction continue to rise</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 11 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The analysis evaluates the extinction risk of 18 species of large ocean fish over nearly seven decades. It provides “a view of the open ocean that we have not had before,” says Colin Simpfendorfer, a marine biologist at James Cook University in Australia who was not involved in this research.</p>



<p>“Most of this information was available for individual species, but the synthesis for all of the species provides a much broader picture of what is happening in this important ecosystem,” he says.</p>



<p>In recent years, major global biodiversity assessments have documented declines in species and ecosystems across the globe, says Maria José Juan-Jordá, a fisheries ecologist at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Madrid. But these patterns are poorly understood in the oceans.</p>



<p>To fill this gap, Juan-Jordá and her colleagues looked to the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List</a>, which evaluates changes in a species’s extinction risk. The Red List Index evaluates the risk of extinction of an entire group of species. The team specifically targeted tunas, billfishes and sharks — large predatory fishes that have influential roles in their open ocean ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red List Index assessments occur every four to 10 years. In the new study, the researchers built on the Red List criteria to develop a way of tracking extinction risk continuously over time, rather than just within the IUCN intervals.</p>



<p>Juan-Jordá and her colleagues did this by compiling data on species’ average age at reproductive maturity, changes in population biomass and abundance from fish stock assessments for seven tuna species, like the vulnerable bigeye and endangered southern bluefin; six billfish species, like black marlin and sailfish; and five shark species. The team combined the data to calculate extinction risk trends for these 18 species from 1950 to 2019.</p>



<p>The team found that the extinction risk for tunas and billfishes increased throughout the last half of the 20th century, with the trend reversing for tunas starting in the 1990s and billfishes in the 2010s. These shifts are tied to known reductions in fishing deaths for these species that occurred at the same time.</p>





<p>The results are positive for tunas and billfishes, Simpfendorfer says. But three of the seven tunas and three of the six billfishes that the researchers looked at are still considered near threatened, vulnerable or endangered. “Now is not the time for complacency in managing these species,” Simpfendorfer says.</p>



<p>But shark species are floundering in these very same waters where tuna and billfish are fished, where the sharks are often caught as bycatch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“While we are increasingly sustainably managing the commercially important, valuable target species of tunas and billfishes,” says Juan-Jordá, “shark populations continue to decline, therefore, the risk of extinction has continued to increase.”</p>



<p>Some solutions going forward, says Juan-Jordá, include catch limits for some species and establishing sustainability goals within tuna and billfish fisheries beyond just the targeted species, addressing the issue of sharks that are incidentally caught. And it’s important to see if measures taken to reduce shark bycatch deaths are actually effective, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is a clear need for significant improvement in shark-focused management, and organizations responsible for their management need to act quickly before it is too late,” Simpfendorfer says. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/metal-sound-flexible-electronics">Zapping tiny metal drops with sound creates wires for soft electronics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Zapping liquid metal droplets with ultrasound offers a new way to make wiring for stretchy, bendy electronics.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade1813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technique</a>, described in the Nov. 11 <em>Science</em>, adds a new approach to the toolbox for researchers developing circuitry for medical sensors that attach to the skin, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry">wearable electronics</a> and other applications where rigid circuit electronics are less than ideal (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers began by drawing on sheets of stretchy plastic with lines of microscopic droplets made of an alloy of gallium and indium. The metal alloy is liquid at temperatures above about 16° Celsius.</p>





<p>Though the liquid metal is electrically conductive, the droplets quickly oxidize. That process covers each of them with a thin insulating layer. The layers carry static charges that push the drops apart, making them useless for connecting the LEDs, microchips and other components in electronic circuitry.</p>



<p>By hitting the microspheres with high-frequency sound waves, the researchers caused the microscopic balls to shed even smaller, nanoscopic balls of liquid metal. The tiny spheres bridge the gaps between the larger ones, and that close contact allows electrons to tunnel through the oxide layers so that the droplets can carry electricity.</p>



<p>When the plastic that the drops are printed on is stretched or bent, the larger balls of metal can deform, while the smaller ones act like rigid particles that shift around to maintain contact.</p>



<p>The researchers demonstrated their conductors by connecting electronics into a stretchy pattern of LEDs displaying the initials of the Dynamic Materials Design Laboratory, where the work was done. The team also built a sensor with the conductors that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wearable-sensor-patch-stroke-patients">monitor blood through a person’s skin</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>Flexible electronics applications aren’t new, says materials scientist Jiheong Kang of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. But there are advantages of the new approach over other designs, he says, such as those that rely on channels filled with liquid metal that can leak if the circuitry is damaged. Liquid metal in the conductors that Kang and colleagues developed stays trapped in the tiny spheres that are embedded in the plastic and remains in place even if the material is torn.</p>



<p>Wires made of liquid metal have often been the go-to conductors for stretchy electronics, says Carmel Majidi, a researcher in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who was not involved with the new study. Using ultrasound introduces a “novel approach to achieving that conductivity.” Other groups have managed that feat by heating circuits, exposing them to lasers, squishing them or vibrating the circuits to get droplets to connect to each other, he says.</p>





<p>Majidi isn’t convinced that the ultrasound approach is a game changer for flexible circuits. But he says that it’s high time the subject is appearing in a leading journal like <em>Science</em>. “I’m personally really excited to see the field overall, and this particular type of material architecture, is now gaining this visibility.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-treated-rare-genetic-disease-womb">This child was treated for a rare genetic disease while still in the womb</a></h4>

              
                <p>A toddler girl is flourishing after receiving treatment for a rare genetic disease. In a first for this disease, she received that treatment before she was even born.</p>



<p>Sixteen-month-old Ayla has infantile-onset Pompe disease — a genetic disorder that can cause organ damage that begins before birth. Babies born with Pompe have enlarged hearts and weak muscles. If left untreated, most infants die before they turn 2. Treatment typically begins after birth, but that tactic doesn’t prevent the irreversible, and potentially deadly, organ damage that happens in utero.</p>





<p>Ayla received treatment while still in the womb as part of an early-stage clinical trial. Today, the toddler has a normal heart and is meeting developmental milestones, including walking. Her success is a sign that <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2200587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prenatal treatment of the disease can stave off organ damage</a> and improve babies’ lives, researchers report November 9 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a great step forward,” says Bill Peranteau, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p>Infantile-onset Pompe disease is a rare condition that affects fewer than 1 out of 138,000 babies born globally. It’s caused by genetic changes that either reduce levels of an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, or prevent the body from making it at all.</p>



<p>Inside cellular structures called lysosomes, GAA turns the complex sugar glycogen into glucose, the body’s main source of energy. Without GAA, glycogen accumulates to dangerously high levels that can damage muscle tissue, including the heart and muscles that help people breathe.</p>



<p>While some people can develop Pompe disease later in life or have a less severe version that doesn’t enlarge the heart, Ayla was diagnosed with the most severe form. Her body doesn’t make any GAA. Replacing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milked-enzyme-thwarts-muscle-disorder">missing enzyme</a> through an infusion can help curb glycogen buildup, especially if treatment starts soon after birth (<em>SN: 4/26/04</em>).</p>



<p>Early studies in mice suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aay8980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment before birth</a> showed promise at controlling a Pompe-like disease. So pediatric geneticist Jennifer L. Cohen of Duke University School of Medicine and colleagues launched an <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04532047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early-stage clinical trial</a> covering Pompe and seven similar conditions, broadly called lysosomal storage diseases.</p>



<p>The team began treating Ayla by infusing GAA through the umbilical vein when her mother was 24 weeks pregnant. Her mother received a total of six infusions, one every two weeks. After birth, the medical team has been treating Ayla with now-weekly infusions, and she will continue to need treatment throughout her life.</p>





<p>The therapy was safe for both mother and child, Cohen says. But until more patients are treated and monitored in the trial, it’s unclear whether this prenatal enzyme replacement is always a safe and effective option. So far, two other patients with other lysosomal storage diseases have received treatment in the trial, but it’s too early to know how they’re faring.</p>



<p>Researchers are also exploring in utero therapies for other rare genetic diseases, including the <a href="https://fetus.ucsf.edu/intrauterine-therapy-alpha-thalassemia-major/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood disorder alpha thalassemia</a>. And in 2018, researchers described three children who were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1714322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully treated for a sweating disorder</a> before they were born.</p>



<p>Such approaches have the potential to treat other rare diseases in the future, Peranteau says. But it will be important to first show that any newly developed treatments are safe and work when given after birth before trying them in utero.</p>



<p>For now, it’s unclear how Ayla and other treated patients will fare over the long term, Cohen says. “We’re cautiously optimistic, but we want to be careful and be monitoring throughout the patient’s life. Especially those first five years, I think, are going to be critical to see how she does.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">Greenland’s frozen hinterlands are bleeding worse than we thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sea level rise may proceed faster than expected in the coming decades, as a gargantuan flow of ice slithering out of Greenland’s remote interior both picks up speed and shrinks.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, the ice stream’s deterioration could contribute to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05301-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 16 millimeters of global sea level rise</a> — more than six times the amount scientists had previously estimated, researchers report November 9 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that inland portions of large ice flows elsewhere could also be withering and accelerating due to human-caused <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change</a>, and that past research has probably underestimated the rates at which the ice will contribute to sea level rise (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>).</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s not something that we expected,” says Shfaqat Abbas Khan, a glaciologist at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. “Greenland and Antarctica’s contributions to sea level rise in the next 80 years will be significantly larger than we have predicted until now.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Khan and colleagues focused on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, a titanic conveyor belt of solid ice that crawls about 600 kilometers out of the landmass’s hinterland and into the sea. It drains about 12 percent of the country’s entire ice sheet and contains enough water to raise global sea level more than a meter. Near the coast, the ice stream splits into two glaciers, Nioghalvfjerdsfjord and Zachariae Isstrøm.</p>



<p>While frozen, these glaciers keep the ice behind them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-marine-ice-cliffs-sheets-collapse-not-inevitable-sea-level">from rushing into the sea</a>, much like dams hold back water in a river (<em>SN: 6/17/21</em>). When the ice shelf of Zachariae Isstrøm collapsed about a decade ago, scientists found that the flow of ice behind the glacier <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac7111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started accelerating</a>. But whether those changes penetrated deep into Greenland’s interior remained largely unresolved.</p>



<p>“We’ve mostly concerned ourselves with the margins,” says atmosphere-cryosphere scientist Jenny Turton of the nonprofit Arctic Frontiers in Tromsø, Norway, who was not involved in the new study. That’s where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-antarctica-are-gaining-ice-inland-losing-melting-overall">the most dramatic changes</a> with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glacier-melt-causes-large-fraction-sea-level-rise">greatest impacts on sea level rise</a> have been observed, she says (<em>SN: 4/30/22, SN: 5/16/13</em>).</p>



<p>Keen to measure small rates of movement in the ice stream far inland, Khan and his colleagues used GPS, which in the past has exposed the tortuous creeping of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">tectonic plates</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). The team analyzed GPS data from three stations along the ice stream’s main trunk, all located between 90 and 190 kilometers inland.</p>



<p>The data showed that the ice stream had accelerated at all three points from 2016 to 2019. In that time frame, the ice speed at the station farthest inland increased from about 344 meters per year to surpassing 351 meters per year.</p>





<p>The researchers then compared the GPS measurements with data collected by polar-orbiting satellites and aircraft surveys. The aerial data agreed with the GPS analysis, revealing that the ice stream was accelerating as far as 200 kilometers upstream. What’s more, shrinking — or thinning — of the ice stream that started in 2011 at Zachariae Isstrøm had propagated more than 250 kilometers upstream by 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is showing that glaciers are responding along their length faster than we had thought previously,” says Leigh Stearns, a glaciologist from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Khan and his colleagues then used the data to tune computer simulations that forecast the ice stream’s impact on sea level rise. The researchers predict that by 2100, the ice stream will have singlehandedly contributed between about 14 to 16 millimeters of global sea level rise — as much as Greenland&#8217;s entire ice sheet has in the last 50 years.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that past research has probably underestimated rates of sea level rise due to the ice stream, Stearns and Turton say. Similarly, upstream thinning and acceleration in other large ice flows, such as those associated with Antarctica’s shrinking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Pine Island</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">Thwaites glaciers</a>, might also cause sea levels to rise faster than expected, Turton says (<em>SN: 6/9/22, SN: 12/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Khan and his colleagues plan to investigate inland sections of other large ice flows in Greenland and Antarctica, with the hopes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">improving forecasts of sea level rise</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Such forecasts are crucial for adapting to climate change, Stearns says. “They&#8217;re helping us better understand the processes so that we can inform the people who need to know that information.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/harlequin-frogs-lazarus-species-extinction-comeback">Some harlequin frogs — presumed extinct — have been rediscovered</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across Central and South America, one group of bejeweled frogs is making a comeback.</p>



<p>Harlequin frogs — a genus with over 100 brightly colored species — were one of the groups of amphibians hit hardest by a skin-eating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll">chytrid</a> fungus that rapidly spread around the globe in the 1980s (<em>SN: 3/28/19</em>). The group is so susceptible to the disease that with the added pressures of climate change and habitat loss, around 70 percent of known harlequin frog species are now listed as extinct or critically engendered.</p>





<p>But in recent years, roughly one-third of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722003378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harlequin frogs presumed to have gone extinct</a> since the 1950s have been rediscovered, researchers report in the December <em>Biological Conservation</em>.</p>



<p>The news is a rare “glimmer of hope” in an otherwise bleak time for amphibians around the globe, says Kyle Jaynes, a conservation biologist at Michigan State University in Hickory Corners.</p>



<h4>The comeback frog</h4>



<p>For Jaynes, the path to uncovering how many harlequin frogs have returned from the brink of extinction started when he heard about the Jambato harlequin frog (<em>Atelopus ignescens</em>). This black and orange frog was once so widespread in the Ecuadorian Andes that its common name comes from the word ”<a href="https://alianzajambato.org/en/jambato-alliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jampatu</a>,” which means “frog” in Kichwa, the Indigenous language of the area.</p>



<p>Then came the fungus. From 1988 to 1989, the frogs “just completely disappeared,” Jaynes says. For years, people searched for traces of the frogs. Scientists ran extensive surveys, and pastors offered rewards to their congregants for anyone that could find one.</p>



<p>Then in 2016, a boy discovered a small population of Jambato frogs in a mountain valley in Ecuador. For a species that had been missing for decades, “it seemed like a miracle,” says Luis Coloma, a researcher and conservationist at the Centro Jambatu de Investigación y Conservación de Anfibios in Quito, Ecuador.</p>



<p>Coloma runs a breeding program for Jambato and other Ecuadorian frogs threatened with extinction. In 2019, Jaynes was part of a group of researchers visiting Coloma’s lab to see if they could work out how these frogs had cheated death. After the Jambato frogs returned to the scene, the team started hearing about other missing harlequin species being spotted for the first time in years.</p>





<p>Those stories led Jaynes, Coloma and their colleagues to comb through reports to see just how many harlequin frogs had reappeared. Of the more than 80 species to have gone missing since 1950, as many as 32 species were spotted in the last two decades — a much higher number than the team had expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we were all shocked,” Jaynes says.</p>



<h4>Ensuring conservation</h4>



<p>The news comes with caveats. For one thing, it seems like most species avoided disappearing by a hair, and their numbers are still dangerously low. So extinction is still very much on the table. “We’ve got a second chance here,” Jaynes says. “But there is still a lot we have to do to conserve these species.”</p>



<p>Ensuring the continuation of the rediscovered species will depend in part on understanding how they’ve managed to survive so far. Some scientists have speculated that amphibians at higher elevations might be more susceptible to the fungus since it prefers lower temperatures.</p>

<p>But a cursory analysis by Jaynes and colleagues revealed that harlequin frogs are being rediscovered at all elevations across their range, indicating that something else may be at play. Jaynes suspects that there is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-frogs-may-be-bouncing-back-after-killer-chytrid-fungus">a biological basis</a> for which harlequin frogs live, such as having developed resistance to the fungus (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>).</p>



<p>Studies like this one can serve as a “launching pad” for understanding how amphibians might survive the dual threats of disease and climate change, says Valerie McKenzie, a disease ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the fact that people are starting to notice the reemergence of species that were once thought to be gone forever “gives me a lot of hope that other species that are harder to observe — because they’re nocturnal or live high in the canopy — are also recovering,” she says. “It motivates me to think we should go look for them.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mahsa Aliakbarzadeh will talk about a paper &quot;On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant
control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar
network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven
control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing
for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor
commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial
signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input
signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing
univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building
adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the
torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed.
Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to
cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking
human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a
bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We
prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default
factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing
cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth
movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant
movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canaanite-comb-lice-israel-alphabet">This ancient Canaanite comb is engraved with a plea against lice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Engraved into the side of a nearly 4,000-year-old ivory comb is a simple wish: Get these lice out of my hair.</p>



<p>This faint inscription, written in the early language of the ancient Canaanites, represents the earliest known instance of a complete sentence written using a phonetic alphabet, says archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>



<p>The writing system of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-offers-clues-canaanites-fate">Canaanites</a>, who lived in a region in the eastern Mediterranean called the Levant until around 2,000 years ago, later served as a major basis for many modern alphabets (<em>SN: 7/27/17</em>). That makes the comb “the most important object I’ve ever found during an excavation,” Garfinkel says.</p>





<p>The Canaanites were a cultural group that traded widely across the Mediterranean. Few of their written records have survived, so most of what researchers know about them come from other documents, such as the Old Testament.</p>



<p>The comb was unearthed in 2016 among the ruins of the ancient city of Lachish in present-day Israel. Years later, when the comb was sent to a lab to search for traces of lice, someone noticed faint symbols etched on the side. A closer look revealed that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.52486/01.00002.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the symbols</a> spelled out the sentence, “May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard,” Garfinkel and colleagues report November 9 in the <em>Jerusalem Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>The discovery may offer a glimpse into the life of one of Lachish’s wealthy denizens. The fact that the sentence refers to a beard suggests it belonged to an elite man, Garfinkel says, since elephant ivory was an expensive good that had to be imported from Egypt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plea against lice is “so human,” says Garfinkel, who notes that other writings from the time tend to center around royal accomplishments or religion. It also appears that the comb was able to fulfill its purpose, at least somewhat. Between the teeth, the researchers found the ancient remains of a louse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-antibiotics-kill-bacteria-drug-resistant-polymyxins">Here’s how mysterious last-resort antibiotics kill bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>To kill drug-resistant bacteria, &#8220;last-resort&#8221; antibiotics borrow a tactic from Medusa’s playbook: petrification.</p>



<p>New high-resolution microscope images show that a class of antibiotics called polymyxins crystallize the cell membranes of bacteria. The honeycomb-shaped crystals that form turn the microbes’ usually supple skins of fat molecules into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33838-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thin brittle sheets</a>, researchers report October 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. When the petrified membranes break, the bacteria die.</p>



<p>The finding was a total surprise, says Sebastian Hiller, a structural biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland.</p>





<p>Hiller, biophysicist Selen Manioğlu and their colleagues had been using the antibiotics as a control for a different experiment. When the researchers turned on their microscopes, &#8220;we saw these waffles,&#8221; Hiller says. &#8220;I immediately recognized, wow, this must be something special.”</p>



<p>Polymyxin antibiotics like colistin were discovered in the 1940s and are now used as a powerful last-ditch defense against bacteria that have evolved resistance to most other drugs. Researchers already knew that polymyxins somehow interfere with bacterial cell membranes. But nobody had imagined a scenario like the &#8220;waffles&#8221; the team discovered.</p>

Manioğlu</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the new study, Hiller and colleagues exposed bits of cell membrane from <em>Escherichia</em> <em>coli</em> to varying concentrations of colistin. Imaging with atomic force microscopy revealed that crystals formed at the minimum concentrations required to kill the bacteria. Colistin-resistant strains exposed to the drug didn’t form crystals.</p>



<p>The results indicate that polymyxins work by arranging the cell membrane into a crystalline structure that leaves it brittle and vulnerable. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that has not even remotely been hypothesized so far,&#8221; says Markus Weingarth, a biochemist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the work. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important study. I&#8217;d even say it&#8217;s a breakthrough.”</p>



<p>How exactly polymyxins crystallize cell membranes remains unclear. That’s a problem because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-resistant-last-resort-antibiotic-appears-us">some bacteria have developed resistance to polymyxins</a> and are becoming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-strike-drug-last-resort">more widespread</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/16</em>; <em>SN: 10/30/90</em>)<em>.</em> Without more studies like this one to help reveal how the drugs work, scientists can’t effectively modify the antibiotics to make them more effective, Weingarth says.</p>





<p>Hiller hopes that this first glimpse of polymyxins’ petrifying powers will help scientists combat resistance to the antibiotics. </p>



<p>&#8220;Understanding these concepts will definitely bring a lot of ideas — and the potential to make new drugs,” Hiller says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fruit-flies-eyes-head-eyestalks">Certain young fruit flies’ eyes literally pop out of their head</a></h4>

              
                <p>Body changes at the brink of adulthood can get awkward in humans, but at least our eyes don’t pop out of our heads on stalks longer than our legs.</p>



<p>High-rise eyes, however, give macho pizzazz to the adult male <em>Pelmatops </em>fruit fly. In one of the stalkier species, <em>P. tangliangi</em>, the eyes-up transformation takes only about 50 minutes, a new study reports. Once stretched, the skinny eyestalks darken and harden, keeping the eyes stuck out like selfie sticks for the rest of the fly’s life.</p>

Just 16 minutes after emerging from the little capsule where he changed from a fat wormy larva into a sleek adult, the eyes are still close to his head (A). Over the following 34 minutes (B–H), the gangly eyestalks grow and eventually darken, stretching the eyes away from the body. The following day, the fully periscoped adult is ready to explore.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118764">N. Huangfu <em>et al</em>/<em>Annals of the Entomological Society of America</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The details of <em>P. tangliangi</em>’s eye lift come from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/115/5/365/6628560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first published photo sequence of their ocular blossoming</a>, which appears in the September <em>Annals of the Entomological Society of America.</em> Biologists have known that eyestalks evolved in eight different fly families. Yet <em>Pelmatops</em> flies have gotten so little scientific attention that a lot of their basic biology has been a string of question marks.</p>



<p>Video images show the eyestalks curl and rise irregularly. Yet “they are not flopping around while partly inflated,” says Xiaolin Chen, an entomologist and evolutionary biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “They seem slightly stiff, but still flexible enough.”</p>





<p>Females of the species may raise shorter eyestalks too — if Chen and her colleagues have found the right females. Chen suspects that what are now named as two species, based on the few specimens available, may just be two sexes of the same species. The new paper describes a male <em>P. tangliangi</em> mating with a female known by a different species name<em>. </em>Her stalks aren’t as magnificent as his, but she has some.</p>



<p>While the headgear can burden a flying insect, long eyestalks may give flies some swagger. These <em>Pelmatops</em> and other kinds of stalk-eyed flies face off, eyestalk to eyestalk, with uppity intruders. There’s no knocking and locking stalks in fierce fly disputes though. Any pushing and shoving, Chen says, is “done with other body parts.”</p>



<p>Extreme eyes may also have other benefits. In the wild, Chen finds these fruit flies on long stems of <em>Rubus</em> berry brambles. The eyes naturally periscope outward and upward, allowing the flies to spot danger while the body stays hidden in the greenery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-springtails-jumps-collembola">Video reveals that springtails are tiny acrobats</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s not just panic and chance. Some of nature’s extreme self-launchers, the springtails, turn out to be much more acrobatic than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Springtails, poppy seed–sized cousins of insects, “are famous because they know how to jump but also famous because they have no control at all according to the literature,” says biomechanist Victor M. Ortega-Jiménez of the University of Maine in Orono.</p>



<p>But in a study published November 7 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, he and colleagues have used high-speed video to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2211283119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenge that received no-control “wisdom.”</a></p>





<p>Springtails tend to be ignored by most people because they are so hard to see with the naked eye. What’s more, the 3,000 plus known species do virtually no harm to people and thus don’t even get the attention we pay to ticks and fleas. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-bacteria-springtails-spore-growth">springtails</a> look like lemon drop candies with big spots of eyes and six legs; other species grow more stretched out (<em>SN: 4/24/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unusual organs used for jumping are one of the reasons springtails are no longer considered insects. Springtails (in the taxonomic group Collembola) evolved as insectlike animals with no wings but a long, hinged ground-smacker, called a furcula, latched underneath the springtail body.</p>



<p>Releasing it to whack downward against the ground, or even against water, launches a springtail high into the air and away from danger such as a hungry fish. Some springtail species have ground-smacked themselves to safety at speeds of 280 times their own body length per second. That’s the jump that biologists used to think would send a little body flipping upward with no control at all.</p>



<p>Questioning that notion starts with pandemic musing, Ortega-Jiménez remembers. He was at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, but with labs closed and “a lot of time with my family on rivers in Georgia,” he says. That’s how he saw springtails launching themselves out of the water but usually landing on land — and the jumps just didn’t look random to him.</p>



<p>Once labs reopened, he and a wide collaboration of colleagues attacked the problem of exactly what happens during springtails’ emergency launches. Focusing on the semiaquatic species <em>Isotomurus retardatus</em>, films at such extreme speeds as 10,000 frames per second showed plenty of control.</p>



<p>Springtails are not in fact just squiggles hurtling helplessly through the air. They curl their bodies while in flight in such a way that they stop tumbling and fall oriented for landing, both video and mathematical models showed. This orienting while falling is something cats and some other animals do well, but Ortega-Jiménez notes that springtails do it faster than any other animal tested, at less than about 20 milliseconds.</p>

</div><figcaption>Long thought to launch themselves randomly into the air when danger threatens, tiny springtails (<em>Isotomurus retardatus)</em> turn out to have some control over their leaping direction. They also curve their body to stop tumbling in air and use a tubelike structure on their underside to help land upright some 85 percent of the time. (High-speed video has been slowed for viewing.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That landing uses another distinctive springtail body part, a short wide tubelike organ called a collophore that sticks down out of the abdomen. The animal in profile looks like some plastic toy just out of a mold with the collophore hanging from its tummy like a tab not snapped off yet.</p>





<p>A bit of water in the tubular collophore gives it some weight that helps keep the jumper from bouncing into somersaults as it splashes down on the water surface.</p>



<p>Springtails in lab pools landed on their feet about 85 percent of the time, the team found. Mimicking the landings with a springtail-inspired robot not much bigger than a penny achieved 75 percent landing success.</p>



<p>All this attention to springtail jumping prowess cheers Anton Potapov, a soil animal ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who was not involved in the study. Springtails “are not only&nbsp;cute and interesting to look at; they are&nbsp;also among&nbsp;the most&nbsp;numerous and functionally important&nbsp;animals on our planet,” he says.</p>



<p>“You can find them virtually everywhere, and&nbsp;they contribute to so many ecosystem processes,” such as plant and microbial growth. Long — and high — may they jump.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-storm-radiation-trees-miyake-event">Catastrophic solar storms may not explain shadows of radiation in trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cryptic chemical signature of unknown origins, hidden for centuries inside the trunks of Earth’s trees, just became even more mysterious.</p>



<p>In the last decade, scientists have discovered traces on Earth of six intense bursts of radiation, known as Miyake events, scattered over the last 9,300 years. The most popular explanation is that these mysterious signatures were left behind by massive solar storms, leading some scientists to warn that the next Miyake event could cripple the world’s electrical grid. But new research, published in the October <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</em>, suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than just solar flares</a> might be behind the enigmatic radiation.</p>





<p>The finding underscores the need for further investigations into these strange bursts, which could potentially harm our society in the future, says physicist Gianluca Quarta of the University of Salento in Lecce, Italy, who was not involved in the study. “Something is not fitting with what we know at the moment.”</p>



<p>Miyake events were first discovered in trees. As trees grow, their trunks accrue layers, or rings, which lock in chemical signatures from their surroundings. By analyzing the composition of individual tree rings, researchers can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-story-book-explores-what-tree-rings-can-tell-us-about-past">uncover clues about environmental conditions</a> going back thousands of years (<em>SN: 6/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>In 2012, physicist Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University in Japan was studying Japanese cedar tree rings when she found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sharp spike in radiocarbon</a> — a variant of carbon that can form when cosmic radiation strikes Earth’s atmosphere — in rings dating to about A.D. 774. Since then, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL093419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five other similar bursts</a>, now named Miyake events, have been detected in tree rings around the world as well as in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polar ice cores</a>.</p>



<p>Due to the spikes’ global occurrence, many scientists contend that the events have an extraterrestrial origin. The most popular explanation is that especially large <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts">solar storms</a>, or flares, blasted Earth with big bursts of radiation (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>The most powerful solar storm in recorded history was the <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101081655332&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1859 Carrington event</a>, which broke telegraph lines and sparked a circuit fire in Pittsburgh. The radiation levels associated with Miyake events are more than 80 times those of the Carrington event, says physicist Benjamin Pope of the University of Queensland in St. Lucia, Australia. “They could pose serious risks to global technology.”</p>



<p>But the solar storm story has holes. Radiation levels from the 774 event <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asna.201412071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have been too high</a> to have come from a single solar flare, some researchers have suggested. And ice cores, which can also store chemical traces of solar flares, have not yet yielded evidence of increased solar activity <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for every Miyake event</a>.</p>



<p>So, Pope and his colleagues put the leading hypothesis to the test. They analyzed all publicly available tree ring data on the six Miyake events using computer simulations of Earth’s carbon cycle. This allowed the team to calculate the duration, timing and amplitude of each event.</p>





<p>If Miyake events are tied to solar activity, they could align with the solar maxima, which occur roughly every 11 years when solar flares become more frequent. But the researchers found no correlation between Miyake events and any phase of the solar cycle. What’s more, the researchers found that two of the events appeared to last longer than a year — unexpectedly long for solar storms, which typically rage for hours or days.</p>



<p>And if solar flares did cause the events, then trees nearer the poles, where Earth’s protective magnetic field is weaker, should contain higher levels of Miyake event radiation. But the researchers found no such trend.</p>



<p>The findings don’t rule out the solar flare hypothesis, Pope says. Insufficient tree ring data could be hiding a link between solar activity and Miyake events, he says. New Antarctic ice-core data — being analyzed by researchers at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization and hopefully published next year — may provide more answers.</p>



<p>Solar flares could still be behind the events, Quarta agrees. Nuances in Earth’s carbon cycle not captured by the simulations could influence the findings. For instance, trees might metabolize radiocarbon at different rates depending on species or latitude, he says.</p>



<p>Though the mystery remains unsolved, Pope isn’t losing sleep over another Miyake event happening anytime soon. There’s about a 1 percent chance of one happening in the next decade, he says. “I’d be more worried about being hit by a bus on my walk to the office.”</p>
