              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">How Russia’s war in Ukraine hinders space research and exploration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Space exploration may seem like a faraway endeavor from Earth’s surface, but events on the ground ripple into space. The Russian war on Ukraine is no exception.</p>



<p>From a rocket launch system to a rover set to explore Mars, a wide range of space missions is facing postponements or cancelations due to escalating tensions on the ground in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion into Ukraine on February 24. The European Union, United States and others have imposed sanctions on Russia; Russia, as a result, is continually changing and canceling its space-related plans. The shifts are having an impact on everything from international collaborations to missions that rely on Russian rockets to get to space.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at some of those projects.</p>





<h4>ExoMars rover</h4>



<p>The ExoMars mission is a partnership between the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. This is a two-part mission to Mars consisting of an orbiter and a rover. The orbiter has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/exomars-mission-set-arrive-red-planet-october-19">at the Red Planet since late 2016</a>, but the Rosalind Franklin rover was supposed to launch this September (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>).</p>



<p>“The sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,” the European Space Agency, or ESA, said <a href="https://www.esa.int/Newsroom/Press_Releases/ESA_statement_regarding_cooperation_with_Russia_following_a_meeting_with_Member_States_on_28_February_2022">in a February 28 statement</a> in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Due to Earth’s and Mars’ orbital geometry, the most direct trajectory for a spacecraft from our planet to Mars repeats every two years, and that launch window remains open for less than two weeks. The ExoMars rover, which will look for signs of past life, was originally to launch in 2020, but due to the pandemic and technical issues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-exomars-coronavirus-technical-issues-delay">it slipped to 2022</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>). Now it’s at risk of slipping again to 2024.</p>



<h4>The eROSITA telescope</h4>



<p>Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma is a space-based X-ray observatory, run jointly by Germany and Russia, that has been mapping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xray-map-sky-erosita-telescope-milky-way">the large-scale structure of the universe</a> for the last two and a half years (<em>SN: 7/8/20).</em> The probe’s main telescope, eROSITA, has discovered hundreds of celestial objects, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-glow-cow-supernova-explosion-black-hole-neutron-star">a bizarre stellar explosion known as a “cow”</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). On February 26, the Germans <a href="https://twitter.com/eROSITA_SRG/status/1498699903480049670">placed eROSITA into safe mode</a> as an action to “freeze co-operation with Russia,” according to a statement from SRG leadership at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a standard, reversible, operation mode of the telescope, in which we do not take data, but keep the vital subsystems on,” says Andrea Merloni, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, also in Garching, and eROSITA’s project scientist. He declined to comment on any other aspect of the mission or collaboration with Russia.</p>



<p>The Russian News Agency TASS reported March 1 that Roscosmos intends to estimate the financial loss of that safe-mode action and other European space-related sanctions, and the Russian space agency will then bill “the European side” of the projects.</p>



<p>ESA, meanwhile, is “assessing the consequences on each of our ongoing programmes conducted in cooperation with the Russian state space agency,” the agency said in its February 28 statement.</p>



<h4>Navigation satellites</h4>



<p>In response to international sanctions against Russia, the head of Roscosmos announced February 26 that the agency was <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rogozin/status/1497456152442978305">suspending cooperation</a> with the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, and withdrawing its dozens of employees from the site. Several space missions were set to launch from this location via a Russian Soyuz rocket in the next year, including a pair of European navigation satellites in early April.</p>



<p>These satellites would have joined with the already-launched two dozen that make up the Galileo navigational system, the European answer to the United States’ GPS system. Two additional Galileo satellites are also in orbit, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-oops-reaffirms-einstein-theory-gravity">they were placed incorrectly</a> and instead focus on science and search and rescue (<em>SN: 12/10/18</em>).</p>



<h4>OneWeb internet network</h4>



<p>The U.K. company OneWeb, which is building a space-based internet network with hundreds of low-Earth satellites, is also facing a launch postponement.</p>



<p>A Soyuz rocket was scheduled to send up a few dozen OneWeb satellites March 4, one of a series of launches aimed at completing the network in 2022. But in the early hours of March 2, the head of Roscosmos tweeted <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1498967071727706114">the space agency wouldn’t launch the satellites</a> without a guarantee from the company that they wouldn’t be used for military purposes. He also demanded the U.K. government sell its share of the mission, which it has refused to do.</p>



<h4>Venera-D mission to Venus</h4>



<p>The Russian-Ukraine war has also affected U.S. space activities, but to a lesser extent than its impact on its European counterparts. NASA has relationships with several commercial partners, so the agency relies less on Roscosmos. But NASA is still feeling some effects.</p>



<p>For instance, in retaliation to U.S. sanctions, the head of Roscosmos tweeted on February 26 that NASA’s participation in <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1497473032813690884">the Russian-led Venera-D mission to Venus would be “inappropriate.</a>” This mission will include an orbiter, lander and surface station, and it will focus on understanding Venus’s former and present habitability.</p>



<p>However, Venera-D won’t launch until late this decade, and NASA has been involved only in some planning groups. The U.S. space agency already has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two of its own Venus missions</a> in the works (<em>SN: 6/02/21</em>).</p>



<h4>International Space Station</h4>



<p>While many areas of cooperation in space with Russia are fraying, the International Space Station collaboration so far remains unchanged. “NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station,” NASA public affairs officer Joshua Finch, at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, said in an e-mailed statement.</p>



<p>Currently, there are two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one ESA astronaut aboard the station. Later this month, a Russian Soyuz capsule is set to return the two cosmonauts and one of the NASA astronauts to Earth, landing in Kazakhstan as scheduled, Finch said.</p>



<p>However, during a March 1 NASA Advisory Council meeting, Wayne Hale, a former NASA associate administrator, recommended the U.S. space agency consider contingencies in case Russia no longer collaborates on the space station. At the same meeting the following day, former U.S. representative Jane Harman recommended that NASA think about what cooperation with Russia will look like going forward.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Other science collaborations at risk</h4>



<p>Space research is not the only area of science experiencing uncertainty due to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Here are two other scientific collaborations showing signs of strain.</p>



<p><strong>Nuclear fusion:</strong> In Southern France, an international group of physicists is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">constructing ITER</a>, which will be the world’s largest plasma physics experiment to produce energy the same way stars do at their cores (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). Seven partner members — including the European Union, Russia and the United States — lead the project and develop the equipment used in the experiment. No one yet knows what the effects on ITER will be because this is a <a href="https://twitter.com/iterorg/status/1498944207024795650">“situation without precedent,”</a> the ITER organization said in a March 2 tweet. <em>— Liz Kruesi</em></p>



<p><strong>Arctic research:</strong>  Since the Arctic Council was established in 1996, its eight full members — including Russia and the United States — have forged agreements on issues from oil spill cleanup plans to scientific cooperation, leading to nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, <a href="https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/arctic-council-nominated-nobel-peace-prize">including in 2022</a>. It’s not yet clear what impacts the war will have on this cooperation, or on other international Arctic efforts, such as U.S.-Russia joint patrols in the Bering Sea and an E.U.-Russia plan to retrieve sunken nuclear submarines from Russian waters. <em>— Carolyn Gramling</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dopamine-mice-rem-sleep-dream">A hit of dopamine sends mice into dreamland</a></h4>

              
                <p>A quick surge of dopamine shifts mice into a dreamy stage of sleep.</p>



<p>In the rodents’ brains, the chemical messenger <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1987">triggers rapid-eye-movement sleep</a>, or REM, researchers report in the March 4 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>During a night’s sleep, people and other animals cycle between phases called non-REM sleep and REM, a sleep stage that usually comes with vivid dreams. But what causes those transitions is mysterious, says neurologist and sleep researcher Thomas Scammell of Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. These new results are some of the first to show a trigger for the shifts, Scammell says. Understanding these transitions in more detail could ultimately point to ways to treat sleep disorders in people. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Certain nerve cells residing in a part of the mouse brain called the ventral tegmental area can pump out dopamine, a molecule that has been linked to pleasure, movement and learning, among other things. These cells can deliver dopamine to the amygdalae, two almond-shaped structures deep in the brain that are closely tied to emotions.</p>



<p>Using a molecular sensor that can tell exactly when and where dopamine is released, neuroscientist Takeshi Sakurai from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and colleagues saw that dopamine levels rose in the amygdalae just before mice shifted from non-REM sleep to REM sleep.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers forced the mice into the REM phase by controlling those dopamine-producing nerve cells using lasers and genetic techniques — a method called optogenetics. Compelled with light, the nerve cells released dopamine in the amygdalae while mice were in non-REM sleep. The mice then shifted into REM sleep sooner than they typically did, after an average of about two minutes compared with about eight minutes for mice that weren’t prompted to release dopamine. Stimulating these cells every half hour increased the mice’s total amount of REM sleep.</p>



<p>Additional experiments suggest that these dopamine-making nerve cells may also be involved in aspects of narcolepsy. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-gone-awry">sudden loss of muscle tone</a>, called cataplexy, shares features with REM sleep and can accompany narcolepsy (<em>SN: 10/9/10</em>). Stimulating these dopamine-making nerve cells while mice were awake caused the mice to stop moving and fall directly into REM sleep.</p>



<p>The results help clarify a trigger for REM in mice; whether a similar thing happens in people isn’t known, Sakurai says. Earlier studies have found that nerve cells in people’s amygdalae are active during REM sleep, he says, hinting at a role for the brain structure.</p>



<p>Many questions remain. Drugs that change dopamine levels in people don’t seem to have big effects on REM sleep and cataplexy, Scammell says. But these drugs affect the whole brain, he points out, and it’s possible that they are just not selective enough. “My overall question about this is, ‘How can we translate this to humans?’” Scammell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/which-solutions-best-support-sharing-and-reuse-of-code/">Which solutions best support sharing and reuse of code?</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager, PLOS</p>



<p>PLOS has released a <a href="http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/tys8p">preprint</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19122611">supporting data</a> on research conducted to understand the needs and habits of researchers in relation to code sharing and reuse as well as to gather feedback on prototype code notebooks and help determine strategies that publishers could use to increase code sharing.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">previous research</a> led us to implement a mandatory code sharing policy at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> in March 2021 to increase the amount of code shared alongside published articles. As well as exploring policy to support code sharing, we have also been <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/exploring-code-notebooks-through-community-focused-collaboration/">collaborating with NeuroLibre</a>, an initiative of the <a href="https://conp.ca/">Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a>, to learn more about the potential role of technological solutions for enhancing code sharing. Neurolibre is one of a growing number of interactive or executable technologies for sharing and publishing research, some of which have become integrated with publishers&rsquo; workflows.</p>



<p>Early conversations with researchers about the NeuroLibre <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html">notebook prototypes</a> suggested we needed to better understand code sharing and reuse from the perspective of both readers and authors. In February 2021 we launched a survey to gather the views of researchers in computational biology and related disciplines. 188 respondents completed the survey.</p>



<p><strong>What did we learn about readers?</strong></p>



<p>Three-quarters of the respondents told us they look at code associated with a research paper at least occasionally, with 39% looking at code frequently or very frequently. Only 6% said they never looked at the associated code, demonstrating that openly available code is valuable to other researchers.</p>



<p>The most common reason (70%) respondents gave for looking at the code was to aid their understanding of the article. Just under half of respondents (48%) want to reuse the code in some way, for example directly reusing the code or reusing selected parts of the code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A &lsquo;Link to code repository&rsquo; (for example Github or Bitbucket) was rated as the most useful method for accessing others&rsquo; code and had almost been universally encountered (98%). Aside from &lsquo;Available on request&rsquo;, respondents rated &lsquo;Link to a website&rsquo; and &lsquo;executable code capsule in the research article&rsquo; as the least useful methods of accessing code.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="524" height="315" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SHPWrKMZkOiFfNRWcEl9dD8NqAOq90AKC2MTy1o3Z7Sm_VTfEV8HCDLNuNKGY-h8lmsMBnwpjy0V3FBkSLswKrHBWPJ4FDOqSTUqP9MQRJ6lZeqYP_VFzwRv_u0Xu-0TRDW-dV0M"></p>



<p><em>Mean usefulness of different methods of code sharing. A score of zero equates to &lsquo;not at all useful&rsquo; and 100 equals &lsquo;extremely useful&rsquo;. The mean values are given above the bars. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval.</em></p>



<p><strong>What did we learn about authors?</strong></p>



<p>Our survey explored how important certain tasks are to researchers when sharing code, and how satisfied they are with their ability to complete them. Overall, authors of articles with associated code are satisfied with their own ability to carry out many code sharing related tasks. Being able to ensure that &lsquo;Readers can easily run the code in the correct environment&rsquo;, and &lsquo;The data and code are in the same place&rsquo;, had the lowest satisfaction scores, implying there may be opportunities for better tools (solutions) to support researchers with these tasks.</p>



<p>The majority of respondents reported that they spend more than one day preparing code for sharing alongside a publication. Using new tools or platforms for preparing and sharing code alongside a publication can require additional costs &ndash; in terms of time and effort &ndash; but&nbsp; there was no consensus, from our results, on whether researchers&nbsp; might be willing to spend additional time on using a tool, e.g. a notebook, to improve the utility of the code they are sharing.</p>



<p><strong>Technological and cultural solutions</strong></p>



<p>The findings of our survey have shown us that whilst researchers recognise the benefits that using code sharing technology bring, such as sharing data and code in the correct environment and allowing readers to easily change parameters, there may be insufficient incentives for researchers to carry out these tasks routinely when publishing in a journal. Most researchers in our survey appear to be satisfied with the community norm of sharing code via a code repository. While technological solutions could help researchers in other ways, to support our goal of increasing sharing and reuse of code, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s focus on the &ldquo;cultural solution&rdquo; of a mandatory policy seems to be the optimal approach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/03/magical-thinking-and-insurance-taking-out-cover-makes-us-feel-that-misfortune-is-less-likely-to-occur/">Magical thinking and insurance: Taking out cover makes us feel that misfortune is less likely to occur</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We’re all prone to a bit of magical thinking now and then. Maybe you try not to step on cracks in case it brings bad luck, or avoid talking about a good situation in case you “jinx” it — even though in reality there’s no way your actions would have any effect on the world.</p>



<p>When it comes to decisions about finances and risk, though, you’d probably claim to be a much more rational thinker. However, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221077791">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> finds that we’re even susceptible to magical thinking when taking out insurance. The team finds that insuring against the loss or damage of a valued possession has what they call a “talisman effect”, making us feel that the misfortune is actually less likely to occur in the first place.</p>



<span id="more-45598"></span>



<p>In the first study, Robert Schindler from Rutgers University and colleagues asked participants to think about an object they had bought for around $100 and that held sentimental value. They imagined taking a holiday for two weeks and renting out the object. Some participants were told they were guaranteed full compensation for loss or damage, while the other participants were given no additional information. Finally, all participants rated the likelihood that their possession would be lost or damaged.</p>



<p>Participants who read about the guarantee thought it less likely that their special object would be damaged (they also thought it was less likely to be lost, though this effect didn’t reach statistical significance). This doesn’t make logical sense, of course: coverage against damage doesn’t mean that the damage is any less likely to happen.</p>



<p>The researchers then looked more directly at the effect of taking out insurance. Participants in this study again thought about a treasured possession, and imagined that they were taking this with them as they moved house. Some participants also read that they had purchased full-coverage shipping insurance from a good company, while others received no extra information.</p>



<p>Those who read that they had taken out insurance again believed it less likely that their object would be damaged or lost compared to the other participants. These people also reported a lower level of anxiety about the potential loss or damage of their object, and this seemed to be partly driving their feelings that they were protected against misfortune.</p>



<p>Using a similar methodology, a third experiment showed that these feelings of anxiety were reduced by taking out insurance from a reputable company, but not from one that was poorly rated. And only participants in the first group showed the talisman effect, believing it less likely that their property would be lost or damaged.   </p>



<p>A final study found that participants in an insured group didn’t just have a reduction in anxiety — they also had fewer negative thoughts about a mishap occurring to their object. We know from other work that more frequent thoughts about an event make it seem more likely to occur, so this could be the mechanism behind the talisman effect. That is, the peace of mind offered by insurance makes us think less often about bad things occurring — and the less we think about them, the less likely we believe they are to actually happen.</p>



<p>The results are worth bearing in mind when considering whether to insure something. Are there good reasons for taking out cover, such as protection against a large financial loss? Or is it possible that you are being motivated by a false sense that insurance will make misfortune less likely to occur?</p>



<p>They also have implications for the insurance sector, the authors write. In particular, insurance companies should not be allowed to imply that their products can actually ward off negative events. The team points to the example of a real health insurance policy called “CancerGuard”: clearly, taking out insurance can’t protect us against getting cancer, but a name like this could play into the kind of magical thinking highlighted in the study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">How to interpret the CDC’s new mask guidelines</a></h4>

              
                <p>One moment, Campbell County in Wyoming’s northeastern corner was an area of high levels of transmission of the coronavirus, a scenario in which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a mask indoors in public places. In the space of a breath, that county got the green light from the CDC that everyone could remove their masks.</p>



<p>Campbell County is not alone. By one measure, in the week of February 20 to February 26, 91 percent of U.S. counties had high or substantial levels of community transmission of the coronavirus, the CDC calculated. The agency recommended <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">wearing masks</a> under those conditions (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). Yet on February 25, just 37.3 percent of counties were considered high risk and in need of masks, the agency projected. How could communities be in the Schrödinger’s cat position of simultaneous mask-on high and mask-off low risk?</p>



<p>Transmission levels of the virus hadn’t changed, but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/science/Scientific-Rationale-summary-COVID-19-Community-Levels.pdf">the way that the CDC calculates risk</a> did. Under previous guidelines, case counts were the most important measure. The CDC labeled counties that exceeded 50 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the past week or had 8 percent of tests coming back positive as places with<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk"> substantial or high transmission</a>. </p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Previous guidance</h4>



<p>The CDC’s old metrics relied on only case counts to determine COVID-19 transmission risk in a community. As a result, much of the country was in the high or substantial levels. Counties with 100 cases or more per 100,000 people or 10 percent or more of positive tests were considered at high transmission risk (red), with lower figures indicating substantial (orange), moderate (yellow) or low (blue).</p>

<p></p>
</div>



<p>With the new guidelines, the CDC shifted focus to levels of severe disease. Case counts are just one of three numbers used to calculate risk. The new metrics raise case thresholds for wearing masks and other precautions to 200 weekly cases per 100,000 people. Below that level of cases is now considered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html">low risk</a>, as long as the number of hospital admissions and percent of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients are also low.</p>



<p>Higher case levels or more hospitalizations — both new admissions and beds filled — mark moderate or high transmission areas, and that’s when recommended public health measures, such as masking and testing, start phasing in again. Individuals can check their county’s COVID-19 levels <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html">using an online tool</a> from the CDC.</p>



<p>The focus on hospitalization aims to provide a glimpse at whether local health care systems have the ability to weather a new COVID-19 surge, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said February 25 at a news briefing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>New metrics</h4>



<p>The CDC’s updated metrics for COVID-19 risk take both case levels and hospitalizations in a community into account. As a result, less of the country is now in the high level. Fewer cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the last seven days mean low transmission (green) while higher numbers indicate medium (yellow) or high (orange) levels.</p>

<p>Now is a good time for such a move, Walensky said. “We’re in a stronger place today as a nation with more tools to protect ourselves in our communities from COVID 19,” she said. With more people across the country <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">vaccinated or recovered from prior infections</a>, the risk for severe disease and hospitalization is lower overall for most people (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). New<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda"> COVID-19 treatments also keep people out of the hospital</a> or reduce the number of days they stay there (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>CDC’s move brought both praise and criticism. On the positive side, the guidelines are based on the most important measurement: levels of severe disease. And masking isn’t the only prevention measure recommended under the guidance: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-testing-treatment">testing, treatments</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">vaccines </a>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">ventilation</a> are also covered (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>; <em>SN: 12/15/21</em>; <em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). All of which can be dialed up or down as needed to combat new surges, the agency said.</p>



<p>But there are drawbacks, too. “These guidelines might delay the response of states and communities to new surges until there’s already a high level of severe disease and death in a community, [which] might ultimately lead to higher levels of severe disease and death,” says Alyssa Bilinski, an infectious diseases modeler at the Brown School of Public Health in Providence, R.I. That delay comes because people tend to be sick with COVID-19 for a week or more before they go to the hospital.</p>



<h3>Imperfect science</h3>



<p>Choosing which number or numbers to base public health policy on isn’t easy and is always imperfect, says epidemiologist Jay Varma, director of Weill Cornell Medicine’s Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response in New York City.</p>



<p>One reason for CDC’s new reliance on hospitalization numbers may be that it’s now harder than before to tell exactly how many people have COVID-19, just based on case counts, he says. Except in the earliest stages of the pandemic, public health officials always knew they were missing some COVID-19 cases, but people’s motivation to get tested was high, testing was readily available, and results of tests were almost always reported. “All three of those things have changed, making it necessary to change your strategy,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Now, even though tests are still widely available, the motivation to test has declined, and more people are testing at home. Those at-home test results aren’t usually reported, leaving public health officials in the dark about how much illness is in the community. Hospitalization numbers and hospital capacity are more accurate measures than case rates and may give public health officials a more solid idea of what’s happening.</p>



<p>“With the tools we have available, I think CDC chose the best options available,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Still, the higher case threshold of 200 cases per 100,000 population that would trigger mask recommendations seems tied to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">highly transmissible, but relatively mild omicron varian</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">t</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Omicron is the most infectious respiratory virus I have ever seen. I’ve never seen a virus spread through a population this fast,” Varma says. But high levels of immunity and a perhaps milder virus means that omicron didn’t cause as many hospitalizations as previous versions of the virus did. That new case threshold may need to be revised downward if another variant that is as contagious as omicron, but nastier, comes along, he says.</p>

<p>New surveillance strategies, built on existing systems, could help researchers keep an eye out for such variants, he says. Throughout the United States, communities take random surveys of doctors&#8217; offices and emergency rooms to see how much influenza-like illness is in the community. The same could be done for COVID-19, he says. In addition, people with respiratory illnesses should be tested for COVID-19, flu and other respiratory viruses at the same time.</p>



<p>One metric Varma says he would not add to CDC’s calculations is vaccination rates, though some people have suggested that. To some extent, vaccination rates are baked into the numbers already because vaccines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">prevent hospitalization and death</a>, which would be reflected in the new admissions and hospital capacity numbers (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). But vaccination rates aren’t as helpful in determining whether people should put on masks to avoid respiratory illnesses.</p>



<p>“Masks are important because they prevent any type of infection. Whereas, vaccinated people can still acquire infection and transmit it to each other,” Varma says. Folding vaccination rates into the equation “might lead you to erroneously think that even though the case numbers are very high, a highly vaccinated population might not need masks as much as a less vaccinated population.”</p>



<h3>Shifting responsibility</h3>



<p>With many politicians and members of the public eager to see an end to pandemic restrictions, CDC’s new guidelines are also a nod to the current political and social climate.</p>



<p>“Right now there’s a movement toward shifting the burden of preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19 from the community onto individuals, particularly individuals who are at higher risk,” Bilinski says. “It has been frustrating how forgotten immunocompromised and other vulnerable people are in these discussions.” Children 5 years old and younger, not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, fall into that group of vulnerable people too.</p>



<p>If public health burdens are being shifted onto individuals’ shoulders, policies should make it easier for people to protect themselves with free N95 masks and testing for those people and their families, she says.</p>



<p>The new metrics are “a move in the right direction,” says Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. But, she says, masks and other public health measures remain important for kids who are too young to get vaccines and the people around them. Though, if there’s less disease circulating in the community overall, then kids will have a lower risk of exposure to the virus, she notes.</p>

<p>Still, Tan doesn’t think everyone will be dropping their masks so quickly. “To wear a mask in areas where you have low to medium transmission is a personal decision,” Tan says. “And there are still going to be a lot of people — myself included&nbsp; — who will continue to wear masks in those situations.”</p>



<p>The CDC’s new guidelines are not intended to discourage wearing masks, Walensky said during the news briefing. “Anybody is certainly welcome to wear a mask at any time,” she said. “We are absolutely endorsing if you feel more comfortable wearing a mask, feel free to do so.”</p>



<p>When making that personal decision, “You should be designing your precautions based on the most vulnerable people in your group,” Bilinski says, “the cancer patients in your life, or the people in assisted living.”</p>



<p>She expects to see less masking in the coming weeks and says that’s appropriate if cases and hospitalizations continue their downward trajectory. “But I still hope people are very ready to put masks back on and think about other precautions when there’s signs of a new surge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fecal-transplant-pills-peanut-allergy-clinical-trial-poop-bacteria">Fecal transplant pills helped some peanut allergy sufferers in a small trial</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHOENIX</strong> — Pills loaded with bacteria from other people’s poop might help adults who are highly allergic to peanuts safely eat the nuts in small amounts.</p>



<p>In a small clinical trial, a one-day treatment of the pills helped some people with the allergy consume one or more peanuts. The results, presented February 26 at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology annual meeting in Phoenix, are a first step toward seeing whether the approach, called fecal microbiota transplant, could extend to people allergic to foods other than peanuts. In the United States alone, about 32 million people have food allergies.</p>



<p>The trial evolved out of past research suggesting that gut microbes help shape the immune system to protect against food allergies. In a 2019 study, Rima Rachid, an allergist-immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, and her colleagues found that certain bacteria were enriched in the stool of babies without food allergies compared with babies who had food allergies. When transferred into allergy-prone mice, these bacteria — the single species <em>Subdoligranulum variabile</em> and a set of <em>Clostridia</em> species — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0461-z">prevented allergic responses</a>. The treatment, a type of bacteriotherapy, activated a subset of immune cells called regulatory T cells, which protect the mice from having allergic reactions.</p>





<p>In people, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/fecal-transplants-regulation">fecal transplants</a> — which take feces from healthy people and transplant it into ill individuals, usually by colonoscopy — have become a standard treatment for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-clostridioides-difficile-antibiotics-chain-mail-armor-shield">recurrent <em>Clostridium</em><em> difficile </em>infections</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/18</em>; <em>SN: 2/25/22</em>). But it wasn’t until research showed that fecal material could achieve comparable success when delivered as oral capsules that Rachid’s team started thinking about doing a trial in people with peanut allergies.</p>



<p>The team partnered with OpenBiome, a nonprofit stool bank, to collect stool samples from healthy donors without allergic diseases and encapsulate the fecal matter into odorless, tasteless pills. The donors had avoided peanuts and tree nuts for a week, and their stool was analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to ensure it contained no traces of nut proteins, Rachid said.</p>



<p>The study enrolled 15 adults with severe peanut allergies. At the start of the trial, each had an allergic reaction to 100 milligrams of peanut protein (less than half a peanut). The first 10 participants took 36 “poop pills” over a three-hour period. After one month, 30 percent (3 of 10 participants) could safely consume a 100-milligram dose of peanuts, and by four months, two of these individuals had increased their tolerance to at least 300 milligrams (about one peanut), enough to guard against most accidental exposures.</p>

<p>The remaining five participants had the same poop pill regimen, except that beforehand they took a four-day course of antibiotics with the aim of killing some of the bacteria naturally found in the body in order to clear space in the gut for the transferred microbes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That strategy seemed to work better. Sixty percent (3 of 5 participants) raised their peanut threshold beyond 300 milligrams by month four. (The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown prevented data collection from several participants at the one-month timepoint.)</p>



<p>Throughout the study, no one suffered serious adverse events or had allergic reactions related to the fecal transplant, Rachid reported.</p>



<p>And in an analysis of participants’ blood samples, the researchers found increased levels of regulatory T cells only in the six people whose peanut threshold rose with bacteriotherapy — confirming what was previously observed in mice.</p>



<p>The results are exciting, says immunologist Cecilia Berin, deputy director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The fact that fecal transplant pills helped a subset of individuals without needing exposure to a specific allergen suggests the approach could potentially be useful for patients with multiple food allergies, she says.</p>



<p>Rachid says her team plans to launch a larger trial this summer with a version of the stool-based treatment called microbial transfer therapy, or MTT. These capsules will contain higher concentrations of bacteria and less fecal material and can be taken at home, rather than in the clinical setting used for the study. A future trial will test a product that ditches the poop altogether and uses just the protective bacterial strains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-maynard-daly-biochemistry-chemistry-history">Marie Maynard Daly was a trailblazing biochemist, but her full story may be lost</a></h4>

              
                <p>Marie Maynard Daly is known as the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, earned in 1947 from Columbia University. It’s a superlative often repeated in the brief profiles of Daly that appear in anthologies of notable Black and female scientists — and an impressive achievement on its own.</p>

<p>Daly published from 1949 to 1985, retired in 1986 and died in 2003 at the age of 82. Her husband predeceased her; she had no children. Most of Daly’s collaborators and colleagues have died in the last decade; her mentees are retired and unreachable; her former employers and professional organizations have minimal or no documents chronicling her life or research.</p>



<p>What we know about Daly comes primarily from her record of scientific publications. While working with biochemists Alfred Mirsky and Vincent Allfrey at Rockefeller Institute in New York City in the early 1950s, Daly found <a href="https://rupress.org/jgp/article/37/2/157/30262/SYNTHESIS-OF-PROTEIN-IN-THE-PANCREAS-II-THE-ROLE">direct experimental evidence</a> that protein synthesis requires RNA. James Watson cited that work in the lecture he gave after receiving the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. Daly also identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147486/">a new type of histones</a> and determined the distribution of different <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147206/">nitrogenous bases</a> within nucleic acids (what we now call DNA and RNA). With Quentin Deming at Columbia University, she identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC289439/?page=1">cholesterol as an underlying cause of heart attacks</a>.</p>



<p>After she moved to Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, Daly extensively studied hypertension and later analyzed how muscle cells <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0003986180901824?via%3Dihub">use</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3970526/">creatine</a> to produce energy. She participated in a study that identified <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/262108/">lesions</a> in the lungs of a dog model of chronic cigarette smoking.</p>



<p>Daly’s studies were rigorous, her results important and her topics varied.</p>



<p>Various anthologies from the 1990s and online articles from the 2000s include some details about her personal life, but they largely reiterate the same handful of facts: Daly was born in Queens, N.Y., in 1921; she read microbiologist Paul de Kruif’s classic 1926 book <em>Microbe Hunters</em> as a child; she sought a doctorate in chemistry because she didn’t think she’d have luck getting a job during World War II. In addition to her research and teaching, Daly organized training programs to prepare minority undergraduates for medical school and graduate science programs.</p>



<p>In a letter from 1970, Abraham White of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where Daly remained until her retirement in 1986, recommends Daly for promotion, citing her “high qualities of leadership,” valuable scientific contributions and administration of the Martin Luther King, Jr.–Robert F. Kennedy Program for Special Studies to recruit and prepare minority students for medical school. It’s one of only two primary documents the college had.</p>



<p>I couldn’t find anyone to speak about Daly — nor could I find any existing interviews. Sibrina Collins, a chemist, writer and executive director of the Marburger STEM Center at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Mich., encountered similar frustrations when she <a href="https://undark.org/2017/08/07/unsung-marie-maynard-daly-women-stem/">wrote</a> about Daly in 2017. Collins found few existing details on Daly’s life aside from the oft-repeated headline about her Ph.D. in chemistry. “It’s wonderful to say that somebody is the first to do something — that’s a nice historical fact — but it’s really important to highlight what they actually did, not just that they were the first,” Collins says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>It’s wonderful to say that somebody is the first to do something &#8230; but it’s really important to highlight what they actually did, not just that they were the first.</p><cite>Sibrina Collins</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/daly-marie-maynard-1921">profile</a> by Janet P. Stamatel, originally written in 2002 for a book series called <em>Contemporary Black Biography, </em>includes actual quotes from Daly<em>. </em>Stamatel, now a sociologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, says she believes she interviewed Daly for that story, but any notes or recording from the interview are long lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>And so Daly’s voice might also be lost. While we can read her papers and recite a few basic facts, there&#8217;s a whole wealth of her life missing. We know nothing of her motivations, convictions, failures and hopes for the future. We can imagine the great challenges she confronted as a woman and a Black scientist in the mid-1900s, but we don’t know how she approached and overcame them. Nor do we know the specifics that drove her to ask certain scientific questions. For instance, why did Daly work on a single study about smoking and lung cancer, a topic seemingly far-flung from her other work? Was she inspired by a loved one with cancer?</p>



<p>The whole research effort left me thinking about the stories society tells about science — whose stories are told, how and by whom. We need to prioritize documenting the stories of scientists, especially of scientists from historically marginalized groups, when and where they do their work. The media, historians, libraries, non-profit organizations, scientists, society as a whole — we can all do better to present opportunities for underrepresented scientists to share their voices and perspectives. Otherwise, we risk losing them altogether.</p>



<p>David Caruso, director of the <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/center-for-oral-history">Center for Oral History at the Science History Institute</a> in Philadelphia, and colleagues have been working to collect those stories, and it takes a concerted effort, he says. Of 722 interviews within the center&#8217;s collections, for example, 96 participants identify as female and 20 identify as African American, Caruso says. Following a multiyear effort to correct the bias in its collections, the organization now makes sure its current efforts are representative of diversity in the scientific and engineering communities, he adds. “Our collection still needs work, but it is improved significantly from what it once was.”</p>



<p>I still think about Daly from time to time, and the questions I would have asked given the chance to interview her. She was a real, feeling scientist driven by passions and shaped by a particular time and place. Her achievement in chemistry is inspiring, but her deeper story is lost to students and scientists who might have learned from her experiences.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781623176051">Fresh Banana Leaves</a><br><em>Jessica Hernandez<br>North Atlantic Books, $17.95</em></p>



<p>During the civil war in El Salvador that began in the 1970s, an injured Victor Hernandez hid from falling bombs beneath the fronds of a banana tree. The child soldier, a member of the Maya Ch’orti’ group indigenous to the region, made a crutch from a branch of the tree and limped toward Guatemala, toward freedom. “I strongly believe that it was this banana tree that saved my life,” he told his daughter, Jessica Hernandez, who shares the story in <em>Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science</em>. “It is ironic because banana trees are not native to El Salvador,” he said.</p>





<p>Jessica Hernandez, an environmental scientist, draws parallels between her father’s story and that of the banana tree. The banana tree’s journey from Southeast Asia via colonial European ships forced the resilient plant to adapt to its new home in the Americas. Similarly, her father adjusted to being displaced, eventually settling in the United States, often experiencing less-than-warm welcomes along the way.</p>



<p>Hernandez uses her father’s stories and other first-person accounts to frame a complex discussion on the interplay between colonialism, the displacement of Indigenous peoples, land degradation, and differences between how Western researchers and Indigenous people approach conservation. Western restoration can often focus on rooting out invasive species, Hernandez points out. But such a narrow focus, she contends, fails to understand that Indigenous people — the lands’ original stewards — are integral parts of imperiled landscapes.</p>





<p>Some researchers are now taking a community-based approach to conservation, in which Indigenous people participate in project planning instead of serving as study subjects. But this still doesn’t go far enough, Hernandez argues: In such studies, non-Indigenous people often end up speaking for Indigenous communities.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Hernandez about what she sees as conservation&#8217;s failures, Indigenous displacement and the connection between the two. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How do you use the term “</strong><strong>Indigenous</strong><strong>”?&nbsp; </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Somebody who still has their ancestral practices, their cultural traditions, their kinships with their people, whether they’re displaced or not, and are native to that region, or to that place that they can call home.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You write about how ecocolonialism — when non-Indigenous “settlers” govern Indigenous lands without consulting Indigenous people — can exacerbate climate change and result in Indigenous displacement and ecological grief. What is ecological grief?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>When I talk about ecological grief, I’m talking about the longing that many [displaced] Indigenous peoples have to return to their lands. Another way to look at that is the relationships that we [Indigenous people] have with nature — especially with our plants, animals and nonliving relatives. When the impacts of climate change destroy them, there’s a mourning that we all undergo as Indigenous peoples.</p>



<p>A lot of settlers have lost their relationships with nature. They view nature as commodities without understanding that some of these natural resources mean something else to many people, aside from economic value.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You also write about how many non-Indigenous scientists practice helicopter research. How does this affect Indigenous communities? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Helicopter research is when scientists come up with a question, but instead of building relationships with a community [whom the] question relates to, [they] just go to the community, collect the data and never come back.</p>



<p>Oftentimes, we see how even some [Indigenous] knowledge is stolen. The example I brought up in the book is how a white man went to the Aboriginal community [in Australia], learned about “permaculture” [a type of self-sustaining farming system that requires minimal input from people, unlike labor-intensive, single-crop agriculture] and came back and was deemed a “founder.” Permaculture is something that you can get certified in, but not necessarily understand that it is Indigenous knowledge. Those funds [from certification courses] are not going to the Indigenous communities whose knowledge system was co-opted.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Are Western conservation efforts that are rooted in good intentions insufficient? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>I get a lot of pushback, especially when we are communities of color speaking up against conservation. We have to look at the impacts, and I think that a lot of the impacts tend to be negative — tend to be oppressive — toward communities of color. [Conservationists] tend to make all these protected areas in other countries, when in reality, they’re jeopardizing that local community’s livelihood. We see that with marine protected areas, where people who rely on fishing for sustenance are not allowed to fish. It also sometimes displaces many people because they have to leave their ancestral lands to find better economic opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conservation is very linear, focused on one species, and doesn’t necessarily look at the entire landscape. Look at the contributors of why a certain species is declining, and sometimes it’s not even that people are overharvesting — it’s climate change and other environmental impacts we tend to ignore.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How can conservationists center Indigenous people in their approaches? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Invite them to the table or let them lead their own table. Indigenous peoples know their lands, know their environments, know some of the changes resulting from climate change. When you’re connected to your environment, you know best how to approach it. Conservationists should include Indigenous peoples as stakeholders, as opposed to always focusing on governments as the stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Aside from the general public, who should read this book?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez</strong>: [Conservation] professionals. People take actions once they start reflecting on how something that they uphold — like the field of conservation — can cause harm.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The label &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; is often slapped on unsubstantiated ideas. But does labelling something a conspiracy theory actually discredit it? A <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12548?af=R">new paper</a> in the  <em>British Journal of Psychology </em>suggests not<em>.</em> Karen M. Douglas at the University of Kent and colleagues<em> </em>find that people call an idea that they already consider unbelievable a &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; — rather than being influenced by that term to disbelieve it.</p>



<span id="more-45579"></span>



<p>In an initial online study on 170 US adults, the team explored whether labelling a statement an &#8220;idea&#8221; or a &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; made any difference to the participants’ attitudes towards it. The statements were taken from an existing conspiracy theory scale; they included &#8220;The power held by heads of state is second to that of small, unknown groups who really control world politics&#8221;, for example.</p>



<p>The results were clear: whichever label was used made no difference to how seriously the statement was taken, or to participants’ ideas about how controversial or believable it was.</p>



<p>These findings support and extend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12285">earlier work</a> that suggested calling an idea a conspiracy theory doesn’t actually reduce endorsement of it. And this is important, because as the team writes: “This suggests that people&#8217;s belief that the label has the power to discredit these narratives may be misplaced.”</p>



<p>The team then ran a second study on 199 students. The participants read a list of statements and rated the extent to which they would call each a conspiracy theory, and also their own level of agreement with the statement. The results showed that the less participants believed the statements to be true, the more likely they were to call them &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221;. This hardly seems surprising. But the team takes it as evidence that pre-existing disbelief leads to use of the term.</p>



<p>In further studies, participants were shown pairs of statements, one more plausible than the other. For example, a statement about the loss of Malaysia flight MH370 came in two forms: &#8220;Malaysia flight MH370 was hijacked by North Korea, a fact known but suppressed by the Malaysian government&#8221; and &#8220;Malaysia flight MH370 was consumed by a black hole, a fact known by suppressed by the Malaysian government&#8221;.  The researchers found that participants tended to rate the less plausible statement as more likely to be a conspiracy theory and were more likely to call people who believed these ideas &#8220;conspiracy theorists&#8221;.</p>



<p>“Taken together, the present results…suggest that the label ‘conspiracy theory’ is likely to be a consequence rather than a cause of (dis)belief in conspiracy narratives,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Why does the “conspiracy theory” label have little power to encourage people to be sceptical about an idea?</p>



<p>As the researchers suggest, one possibility is that we know from experience that the label tends to be used by sceptics, so we may decide that the person using that label is biased, and resist their influence. Other work has also found that some people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that they think are unpopular <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">because it satisfies their need to feel special</a>. For these people, it’s possible that if the label is applied, this could backfire, and make the idea more appealing.</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed on how to tackle belief in conspiracy theories. But this research certainly further builds the case that simply calling them conspiracy theories won’t help.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12548?af=R">Is the label ‘conspiracy theory’ a cause or a consequence of disbelief in alternative narratives?</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-fynbos-plants-roots-long-thin-nutrients">Africa’s fynbos plants hold their ground with the world’s thinnest roots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some plant roots draw a line in the sand — literally.</p>



<p>In South Africa, you can move between cool, green forest and sunbaked shrubland in a single stride. These narrow borders between dramatically different ecosystems are maintained by intense competition between plants’ roots, new research suggests.</p>



<p>Fynbos — a type of species-rich shrubland found only on the far southern tip of Africa — has <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/9/e2117514119">the thinnest roots by far</a> of any plant community in the world, researchers report in the March 1 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. These nutrient-gobbling roots, plus some fire-encouraging adaptations, help turn the fynbos into an austere realm where only fynbos plants can survive.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Interested in what factors organize nature at very broad scales, ecologist Lars Hedin and his colleagues wanted to look at places where environmental changes over time can flip the ecosystem between two distinct states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the fynbos. It’s a low, shrubby habitat home to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smokey-gardener">mind-blowing plant diversity</a>: more than 7,000 species, most of which are found nowhere else in the world (<em>SN</em>: 8/24/2004).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s one of the most floristically biodiverse systems in the world,” says Hedin, of Princeton University. “It’s essentially as diverse as a tropical forest.”</p>



<p>But right next to this hot, flower-filled wonderland — with the same climate and underlying geologic composition — is the lush Afro-temperate forest, flourishing with tall trees and moss, but fewer species overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The boundary is as sharp as one meter. It’s like a binary, zero to one transition,” says study coauthor Mingzhen Lu, an ecologist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. This is far narrower than the transition zone between savanna and tropical rainforest, he says, which can occur over many kilometers. </p>



<p>To investigate what underlies these sharp borders, the team compared root samples from both fynbos and forest systems. They also conducted transplant experiments, moving Afro-temperate forest plants to the fynbos and tracking their growth over four years. The researchers kept fynbos plant roots away from the transplants and manipulated nutrient levels in some plots to unveil limiting factors for the forest plants.</p>



<p>When kept away from fynbos roots or offered more nitrogen, forest trees grew five times as fast as those that experienced competition or nutritional disadvantage, the team found. That suggests the fynbos plants keep invading plants away by monopolizing nutrient access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below the surface, the story becomes even clearer. The fynbos plants have long, thin roots that act like nutrient-seeking missiles, snaking through the soil where other roots can’t reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s a competitive advantage,” Hedin says. “That’s an underground weapon.”</p>



<p>The median root tip thickness in the fynbos plant community is about 0.1 millimeters, or around one-quarter to one-half the thickness of any other root system in the world.&nbsp;“The thickest fynbos roots are still thinner than the thinnest [Afro-temperate] forest roots,” Lu says.</p>



<p>Compared to the forest plants, fynbos roots are also 10 times as long. A gram of some fynbos plants’ root tissue – about the mass of a thumbtack – can stretch over 15 football field lengths of territory.</p>



<p>The researchers think that the fynbos creates “nutritional misery” for any nonfynbos plant, making the soil around the fynbos nutrient poor with their hyper-efficient roots. Also, a large proportion of fynbos shrubs and grasses are highly flammable, making the ecosystem prone to particularly intense fires. The fires burn so hot that they volatilize soil nitrogen into the air, removing those nutrients from the area too. Rather than engineering their surroundings to enhance nutrient levels, the plants may be doing the opposite — sabotaging the nutrient supply — to give themselves the upper hand against would-be encroachers.</p>

<p>“You can try to invade, you’re not going to stand a chance,” Hedin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fynbos-forest borders waver over the years between fire cycles, with the wet forest mostly rebuffing the flames and the fynbos eventually casting out trespassers.</p>



<p>A long prevailing idea about large ecological communities, Hedin says, is that they are largely driven by nonliving factors, such as climate, topography and geology, where organisms adapt to localized conditions. But in this case — and maybe others — “alternative stable states” arise from a war waging between organisms.</p>



<p>The findings demonstrate how pieces of this puzzle — fire, plant traits above and below ground and feedbacks between soil and plant, to start — illuminate the processes behind the creation and maintenance of the two coexisting vegetation zones, says Gerlinde de Deyn, a soil ecologist at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The thinness of the fynbos plants is “striking,” de Deyn says, but the role of root-associated fungi in the ecosystem needs to be addressed. These fungi are normally heavily involved in soil nutrient cycling and could be contributing to the roots’ efficient nutrient uptake, rather than the roots doing it all by themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>In the fynbos, there may also be lessons for how root traits help or hinder the spread of invasive plants, Lu says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">How omicron’s mutations make it the most infectious coronavirus variant yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>In November, a new coronavirus variant took the world by storm. Omicron has since caused an unprecedented wave of infections, striking about 90 million people in just 10 weeks. That’s more COVID-19 cases than were recorded in all of 2020.</p>



<p>Omicron also left scientists scratching their heads. It’s riddled with mutations, which might normally doom a virus. Early experiments showed that omicron wasn’t nearly as good as the previous coronavirus variant champ, delta, at melding with a cell’s membrane — crucial for infecting that cell — or at replicating in lung cells. Yet here it was, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed">sweeping delta virtually off the map</a> in just weeks in some places (<em>SN: 2/10/22</em>). Omicron even managed to infect people who already had immunity to the virus from vaccines or previous cases of COVID-19. How, researchers wondered, was omicron doing it?</p>



<p>“It’s a very interesting variant,” says virologist Shan-Lu Liu, who codirects the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program at The Ohio State University in Columbus. “I call it weird.”</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Researchers in Botswana and South Africa were the first to unveil omicron’s genetic makeup. Their analysis revealed more than 60 mutations, including 42 changes alone in omicron’s spike protein — the knobby structure on the surface of the virus that initiates a cell break-in and can help evade antibody defenses. Some of those mutations have popped up in previous variants, including alpha and delta. But omicron has never-before-seen tweaks and unique combinations of mutations.</p>



<p>Scientists have been scrambling to discover how those changes affect omicron’s ability to infect people and cause disease. Researchers around the world are infecting cells in lab dishes with omicron mimics, putting the virus under the microscope, testing the viral variant in lab animals and examining medical and other records all to discover what makes the variant tick. Here’s what scientists have found so far.</p>



<h4>1. Omicron keeps it together.</h4>



<p>The secret of omicron’s increased transmissibility has proven elusive. The spike protein is certainly one key to its success, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00852-5">allowing omicron to infect</a> nearly 10 times as many cells as earlier versions of the virus, researchers in China reported December 17 in <em>Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy</em>.</p>



<p>It is “distinct from all other variants, from a structural point of view,” says structural biologist Priyamvada Acharya. She and her colleagues at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute in Durham, N.C., used cryo-electron microscopy and other techniques to examine omicron’s spike protein.</p>



<p>In past studies, researchers, including Acharya, have pinpointed how certain mutations have given previous variants a leg up. For instance, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">mutations in the delta variant’s spike protein</a> helped that version of the coronavirus more easily grab a human protein called ACE2 or more readily fuse with human cells (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>). Omicron shares some of those mutations but has many others that drastically change how the variant behaves. “It’s not just one thing,” Acharya says. “It’s multiple properties of the spike that confer an advantage to omicron.”</p>



<p>Like other versions of the coronavirus, each of omicron’s knobby spikes consists of three identical pieces that snap together in a single unit. Each of those pieces has a jointed, fingerlike portion called the receptor binding domain that reaches out, much like the prongs of a claw machine, to grasp ACE2 and anchor the virus to the cell it will infect.</p>



<p>Many antibodies that prevent the virus from entering cells target those fingers. But omicron keeps its knuckles bent, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.25.477784v1?ct=">hiding the bits that antibodies will attack</a>, Acharya and colleagues reported in a preprint, which has not been peer reviewed yet, posted January 26 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Acquiring more mutations</h3>



<p>The omicron variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible and can evade the immune system better than earlier versions of the virus, thanks in large part to mutations in spike protein. Shown here in red are locations of the mutations in the spike proteins of the delta (left) and omicron (right) variants.</p>

<p>This closed-fist strategy helps the variant evade the immune system. But the fingers eventually have to extend in order to grasp ACE2. Some mutations essentially spring-load omicron’s claw so that it can shoot out at least one finger to snag ACE2. That ensures some of the spike proteins studding the surface of the virus are always pointing the way to infect cells, Acharya and colleagues found.</p>



<p>Delta and alpha variants of the coronavirus were also likely to have multiple extended fingers, but those variants’ efforts to open up “went way too far … to the point that they lost control and fell apart,” Acharya says. Omicron contains mutations that stabilize the spike protein through hydrogen bonds — weak electrostatic connections between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule with a negatively charged atom in another molecule. As a result, omicron doesn’t become floppy the way the earlier variants do, the Duke group discovered. Another group also found new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7760">hydrogen bonds and other connections</a> that help omicron keep itself together, researchers reported January 20 in <em>Science</em>. “I think omicron has struck just the right balance,” Acharya says.</p>



<h4>2. With omicron, opposites <em>really</em> attract.</h4>



<p>Simple attraction may be one key to omicron’s success.</p>



<p>“In the cellular environment, it can be difficult to find your partner,” says computational biologist Hin Hark Gan of New York University. Mutations in omicron’s receptor binding domain give that fingerlike portion of the protein a positive electric charge, Gan and NYU colleagues in New York City and Abu Dhabi reported February 14 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>That electric charge complements ACE2’s negative charge, creating an electrostatic force that attracts the two proteins like a static-charged balloon to a wall, even over relatively long distances, the researchers propose in their preliminary report. Omicron’s electrostatic attraction to ACE2 is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.13.480261v1?ct=">three to five times greater than more neutrally charged delta’s</a>, the team found. The electrical attraction may make it easier for omicron to locate ACE2 on cells. Once the virus gets close to the human protein, other types of forces, including hydrogen bonds, cement the connection, he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Changing charge</h3>



<p>Mutations in the omicron spike protein (right) have made it more positively charged (blue) than the delta variant’s spike (left). The charge attracts omicron toward the negatively charged ACE2 protein on human cells even across relatively large distances. Negative charges are shown in red and neutral parts of the protein in white.</p>

<h4>3. Omicron may sneak in a cell’s back door.</h4>



<p>Multiple teams around the world have recently proposed another thing that makes omicron special: The variant may not use the same entry route into cells that earlier versions of the virus use.</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">two major ways the coronavirus can enter cells</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>). Both start with grabbing ACE2. In the direct route, a scissorslike protein called TMPRSS2 snips away part of the spike protein, revealing a portion that allows the virus to fuse with human cells and immediately dump its RNA inside to make new viruses. That is the way all previous versions of the SARS-CoV-2 have entered human cells.</p>



<p>But omicron may take a back door through a compartment inside the cell membrane called an endosome. There, a different scissorslike protein called cathepsin L cleaves the spike protein to allow the virus to dump its payload into the cell.</p>



<p>Omicron <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04474-x_reference.pdf">doesn’t use the TMPRSS2 pathway efficiently</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04479-6_reference.pdf">relies more on cathepsin</a> L to get into cells, two groups of researchers independently reported February 1 in <em>Nature</em>. As a result, omicron doesn’t fuse as well with cell membranes as delta does, those teams and other preliminary reports suggest.</p>



<p>That could seem like a handicap. But for omicron, it may be a good thing, Liu of Ohio State says. While the virus needs to fuse with cell membranes to get inside and replicate, too much fusibility may lead cells to merge with each other and die, he says. That would leave the virus with nowhere to copy itself.</p>



<p>Omicron may have struck the perfect balance between being fusible enough to enter cells, but not enough to kill its host, he says. This characteristic may also make omicron less likely to cause severe disease.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A different door</h3>



<p>Omicron may use an alternate entry route into cells compared with other coronavirus variants, some research suggests. After latching on to an ACE2 protein on a host cell’s surface, SARS-CoV-2 (red) usually goes through the front door, where a scissorslike protein called TMPRSS2 cuts off a part of the spike protein to unlock the door (as illustrated in the panel at left). But some data indicate omicron may use a back door, entering cells through endosomes, where a protein called cathepsin L is the locksmith (right).</p>

<p>Once in the endosome, though, the viruses come up against a gang of protein guards called IFTIMs that block entry. But both delta and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.31.474653v1">omicron have that problem licked: They breeze past</a> those backdoor guards, researchers in the United Kingdom reported January 3 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Still, some researchers are not convinced that omicron uses the endosome back door into cells. In mimics of human airways grown in lab dishes, omicron used the direct route, but <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.19.476898v1">may be using a different — and still unknown — set of scissors</a> than TMPRSS2, Bart Haagmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues reported January 20 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Haagman’s team infected various types of cells with omicron, delta or earlier versions of the coronavirus. In the first couple of days of infection, omicron infected more cells than delta did, and replicated faster, giving omicron a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Omicron was able to infect cells that don’t have an endosome back door but do have TMPRSS2. It infects these cells much less efficiently than earlier versions of virus do. In another experiment, a chemical that blocks cutting by TMPRSS2 and other similar scissors proteins stopped omicron from breaking into cells, suggesting that some sort of spike cutter is still needed. Together, those results indicate that omicron uses TMPRSS2 inefficiently and might use different scissors all together, the researchers conclude. Those unknown scissors aren’t on lung cells, as omicron has a hard time breaking into those cells in lab dishes, the team found. That work is still preliminary, Haagmans stresses, and it is difficult to predict from studies of cells grown in lab dishes how the virus will behave in humans.</p>



<p>Acharya’s group sees another possibility: Omicron may not need scissors to trim it before it can enter cells. Some of omicron’s mutations may expose the fusion peptide portion of the spike responsible for melding the virus with cells. It’s possible that omicron could fuse directly with cells without being snipped, she speculates. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Omicron may use multiple routes for cell entry, depending on which type of cell it is infecting and what host proteins are available, Liu says. “It’s mixed. It’s not one or the other,” he says. Using different scissors or entry routes would allow omicron to break into potentially more types of cells than other versions of the virus could crack.</p>



<p>But the entry point may not matter as much as other of omicron’s characteristics, Liu says. “My take is that the major reason that this [version of the] virus spreads so fast is because it evades antibody protection.”</p>



<h4>4. Omicron is evasive.</h4>



<p>As omicron took over globally, it quickly became obvious that the variant could slip past antibodies and patrolling immune cells. <a>Unvaccinated people remained the most likely to get infected, with </a><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status">3,230.1 of every 100,000 unvaccinated people</a> developing a case of COVID-19 at the height of the omicron peak on January 8, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But a startling 1,467.31 of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people also got breakthrough infections at that time. And fully vaccinated people who got a booster dose were still being infected at a rate of 1,053.6 for every 100,000 people on January 8. That far exceeds even slippery delta’s peak rate of 699.12 of every 100,000 unvaccinated and 140.8 of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people on August 28.</p>



<p>A study of the Moderna vaccine’s effectiveness conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California in December found that two doses of the mRNA vaccine were about 80 percent effective at protecting against delta infection from 14 to 90 days after inoculation. That effectiveness slipped to 68.9 percent for people three to six months out from their second shot. A booster shot raised the effectiveness against delta infection back to nearly 94 percent, though it dipped to 86 percent after two months. Both two and three doses of the vaccine gave better than 99 percent protection against hospitalization from delta, researchers reported February 21 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Contrast those figures with omicron. Two doses of Moderna’s vaccine were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01753-y">44 percent effective at preventing omicron infection</a> from 14 to 90 days after getting the shot, quickly dipping to 23.5 effectiveness in the three- to six-month period after getting jabbed. A booster shot brought the effectiveness against omicron infection up to 71.6 percent for about two months, after which it declined to 47.4 percent. Against hospitalization from omicron, two doses were 84.5 percent effective. A booster dose brought effectiveness against hospitalization back above 99 percent.</p>

<p>How did omicron manage to get past the highly effective vaccine? The variant swapped out or is missing some of the spots on the spike protein where antibodies latch on to other variants, multiple studies show. And new data that hasn’t yet been vetted by peer-review may suggest other reasons omicron is so sneaky.</p>



<p>First, the variant’s spike protein has that closed-fist stance that protects its ACE2-grabbing bits from antibodies. It has also changed shape slightly to tuck away other spots where antibodies can bind, helping the protein escape from the immune system, Acharya and colleagues found. For instance, one popular hitching post for antibodies is called the N-terminal domain, but there are so many mutations that, “omicron has completely destroyed the N-terminal domain for antibodies. Nothing binds there,” she says.</p>



<p>Another evasion tactic: Omicron is especially good at spreading from cell to cell where the immune system can’t catch it as easily as when it is outside of cells, Liu and colleagues reported December 20 at bioRxiv.org. Despite not being good at fusing cells together, the variant is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.16.472934v1.full.pdf">nearly 5 times better at cell-to-cell spread</a> than an early version of the virus.</p>



<p>Plus, the same electric charge that helps omicron’s receptor binding domain to hold ACE2 may repel antibodies, the New York University researchers found. The team tested a handful of monoclonal antibodies taken from people who had recovered from COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Just like the omicron spike protein, those antibodies all carried positive electrical charges, which may act like a force field keeping antibodies away from the spike protein.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479776v1?ct=">strategically placed sugar molecule</a> stuck to the receptor binding domain may also obscure the spike protein from immune system attack, researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison reported February 10 at bioRxiv.org.</p>





<h4>5. Even with many mutations, omicron seems relatively mild.</h4>



<p>About the only good news about omicron is that it is less likely than the delta variant to cause severe disease. “It is definitely less virulent than delta,” says William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.</p>



<p>But there are <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2119682">challenges to pinpointing just how dangerous omicron may be</a>, Hanage and Harvard colleague Roby Bhattacharyya discussed February 2 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Hospitals full of COVID-19 patients infected with omicron attest that the variant still has teeth and can cause severe illness or kill people. While <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w">v</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w">accines</a> and immunity from prior or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn8057">breakthrough infections</a> may blunt omicron’s edge, its increased infectiousness and slipperiness may offset its reduced nastiness.</p>



<p>Even so, “you would definitely rather have 750,000 daily cases of omicron than delta, because delta would be much worse,” Hanage says. For instance, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054357/Technical-Briefing-36-11February2022_v2.pdf">risk of dying from omicron is about 60 percent lower</a> than the risk of death from a delta infection, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency reported February 11.</p>



<p>One reason for omicron’s relative mildness may be that it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04479-6_reference.pdf">doesn’t replicate as well in lung cells</a> as it does in the airways that feed the lungs, researchers in Hong Kong reported February 1 in <em>Nature</em>. That finding, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">initially reported</a> in December, has also been confirmed with preliminary work from Haagmans and others (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>Another omicron Achilles’ heel may be that it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00619-9">triggers interferon responses</a>, the frontline of the immune system’s antiviral defenses, a study published January 21 in <em>Cell Research</em> found.</p>



<p>Gan of New York University speculates that omicron’s positive charge may cause the viral variant to get trapped in negatively charged mucus more easily than previous variants were.</p>



<p>Still, “omicron can be dangerous in a number of ways,” including landing vulnerable people in the hospital and sickening large numbers of hospital staff at the same time, Hanage says. “It is definitely milder, but that’s not a reason to chill.”</p>



<p>Add to that the fact that a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">sibling version of omicron called BA.2</a>, which has some different mutations from the original omicron, has now burst on the scene (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). BA.2 seems to be slightly more infectious than the original version. Though cases of omicron are falling overall, BA.2’s proportion of those cases is growing, and some experts warn that it could prolong the omicron outbreak or lead to another wave of infections.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-kitchen-bacteria-microbe-diversity">Why kitchen sponges are the perfect home for bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask bacteria where they’d like to live, and they’ll answer: a kitchen sponge, please.</p>



<p>Sponges are microbe paradises, capable of housing 54 billion bacteria per cubic centimeter. In addition to being damp, airy and loaded with food scraps, sponges <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00961-w">provide an optimal physical environment for bacteria</a>, researchers report February 10 in <em>Nature Chemical Biology.</em></p>



<p>Just like humans, bacteria prefer different levels of interactions with their peers. Some bacteria are more social, while others prefer solitude. Lingchong You, a synthetic biologist at Duke University, and colleagues wondered how separating different types of microbes would affect their community interactions. They found that intermediate levels of separation — similar to that found in a sponge — maximize the diversity of the community.</p>





<p>The researchers distributed different strains of <em>E. coli </em>onto plates with anywhere from six to 1,536 wells, which functioned as isolated compartments. After 30 hours, the team examined the number and types of bacterial strains on each plate. <strong></strong></p>





<p>Each compartment is like a party to which the bacteria were randomly assigned, You says. With only six compartments, each party probably has a similar mix of characters, and only the social bacteria survive. With 1,536 compartments, each microbe is probably alone, and the social bacteria die. But an intermediate number of compartments maximizes the odds that a microbe attends the party it prefers. An antisocial microbe might die at a party that’s dominated by socializers, but another antisocial microbe might wind up at a chill gathering and survive. Biodiversity is preserved.</p>



<p>“In retrospect, it’s very, very intuitive,” You says. “What we have identified is a principle that&#8217;s universally applicable for any microbial communities.”</p>



<p>Kitchen sponges, with an array of large and small holes, not only offer an ideal number of compartments for bacteria, but also provide a range of varying-sized parties that can suit more of the microbes’ needs. In experiments with a kitchen sponge, the researchers found that the resulting bacterial community was more diverse than those produced in liquid cultures, a common method of growing bacteria in a laboratory.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bacteria partying in your sponge are mostly nonpathogenic. But if dangerous bacteria — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/chicken-poses-significant-drug-resistant-salmonella-threat"><em>Salmonella</em> from raw chicken</a> — do show up, the sponge’s optimal structure will probably help them survive (<em>SN: 8/9/10</em>).</p>



<p>“Sponges are not really well-suited for kitchen hygiene,” says Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany, who was not involved in the study. “There&#8217;s hardly any sterile surface at home, but the kitchen sponge is probably the most densely populated item at home.”</p>



<p>The good news is that it’s easy to solve the problem. Brushes are a much safer alternative. And if you love your sponge, don’t use it for meat juices. No need to invite bad bacteria to the party.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are many factors that impact our health, from our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/27/financial-stress-in-early-adulthood-is-related-to-physical-pain-decades-later/">finances</a> to our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/">emotions</a> to the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/15/good-time-management-seems-to-have-a-bigger-impact-on-wellbeing-than-work-performance/">way we work</a>. Education is one such factor, with research suggesting that higher levels of education can lead to better health and even a longer life. But what about the education of your partner?</p>



<p>This is the subject of a new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00221465211063879">study</a> from an Indiana University team, published in the <em>Journal of Health and Social Behaviour</em>. The researchers find that people’s own health is positively associated with their spouse’s level of education, suggesting that education and other factors such as knowledge, skills and finances can be seen as shared resources.</p>



<span id="more-45570"></span>



<p>The team used data from a longitudinal study first administered to graduating high school seniors in Wisconsin in 1957 and at various points until 2011. Siblings of these graduates were also surveyed multiple times between 1977 and 2011, and spouses and sibling’s spouses in 2004 and 2006. Surveys were completed via the phone and mail.</p>



<p>For this study, surveys from 2004 to 2006 were most relevant. The team looked at the educational attainment of the original participants (as well as their spouses, their siblings and their siblings’ spouses), measured by years spent in education. Participants and siblings also characterised their own health, indicating whether it was “very poor”, “poor”, “fair”, “good” or “excellent”, and answered retrospective questions about their health before marriage, up to the age of 16. Finally, participants indicated whether or not they had ever smoked and for how long.</p>



<p>All this data allowed the researchers to look at pairs of siblings, to see how the education level of each of their spouses impacted their health. The benefit of this analysis is that it makes it less likely that any differences in health could be the result of hard-to-measure differences in social upbringing: after all, siblings are likely to have had a very similar upbringing. And the team found that spousal education was indeed a significant predictor of self-reported health: a sibling whose spouse had a higher level of education tended to report better health. This remained the case when adjusting for other factors that the team <em>could</em> measure, such as participants’ own education, social background, and health status before and after marriage.</p>



<p>The authors suggest that high levels of education provide shared social, intellectual, emotional, and financial resources (though this also depends on a person’s ability to share those resources with others) — things like higher levels of emotional intelligence, particular skills or knowledge, or more money. So although an individual’s own level of education is clearly important for their health, they also reap the benefits of their partner’s education.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the effects varied by gender: for women, self-reported health was more closely tied to their spouse’s education than for men. The team suggests this may have something to do with the time period the study took place — women in this sample had lower levels of education and lower occupational achievements than the men, suggesting that their male spouse’s resources were more likely to have a shared impact.</p>



<p>This also points to a limitation of the paper: the time period of the study may limit its generalisability to more modern relationships. Future work on this topic could explore whether the increased effect in women would still persist in today’s somewhat more equal world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">A UN report shows climate change’s escalating toll on people and nature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neither adaptation by humankind nor mitigation alone is enough to reduce the risk from climate impacts, hundreds of the world’s scientists say. Nothing less than a concerted, global effort to both drastically curb carbon emissions and proactively adapt to climate change can stave off the most disastrous consequences, according to the latest report from the United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.</p>



<p>That dire warning comes as the effects of climate change on people and nature are playing out across the globe in a more widespread and severe manner than previously anticipated. And the most vulnerable communities — often low-income or Indigenous — are being hit the hardest, the report says.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s the strongest rebuttal that we&#8217;ve seen yet of this idea that we can just adapt our way out of climate change and we don&#8217;t have to mitigate emissions,” says Anne Christianson, the director of international climate policy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the report.</p>





<p>A consortium of 270 scientists from 67 countries synthesized the report after reviewing over 34,000 studies. Released February 28 as part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment of climate science, the report details how the impacts of climate change are playing out today in different regions, and assessed the capacities of communities and regions to adapt.</p>



<p>Many countries understand the need for climate adaptation. And modern solutions, such as the building of urban gardens or adoption of agroforestry, where implemented, appear to show promise. But, the report finds, efforts to adapt are, by and large, reactionary, small and drastically underfunded. As a result, about 3.3 billion to 3.6 billion people remain highly vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme weather events, sea level rise and food and water shortages. The need for adaptation is greatest — and growing larger — in low-income regions, most notably in parts of Africa, South Asia, small island states and Central and South America.</p>



<p>The report also underscores the importance of involving those who are impacted the most in climate plans. “We can no longer just make these decisions at the highest level; we need to include local stakeholders, Indigenous groups, local communities and those who are most as at risk for climate change, such as women, racial minorities, the elderly and children,” Christianson says.</p>



<p>Last August, a previous report, also part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment, covered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the physical science underpinning climate change</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). In that report, scientists stated loud and clear that there was no time to waste. By 2030, carbon emissions need to be cut in half, compared with 2017 levels, to prevent global temperatures from climbing 1.5° Celsius above the preindustrial baseline, the report found. Beyond that baseline, the capacity for humankind and nature to adapt severely deteriorates. In a bit of good news, the authors of that 2021 report also found that if all carbon emissions were to cease today, global temperatures would stop rising in about three years, not the 30 to 40 years once thought. In other words, we can make a big difference in very little time.</p>



<p>Still, climate change is already affecting many parts of Earth. And some of the consequences aren’t going away anytime soon. Sea level will continue to rise for decades, driven in part by<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change"> the runaway melting of Greenland’s ice sheet</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 9/30/20</em>). By 2050, sea level along U.S. coastlines <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html">will have risen by 25 to 30 centimeters, or roughly one foot</a>, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">climate-fueled wildfires</a> have already caused mass mortalities of corals and other animals and trees, and pushed entire species toward the brink of extinction (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>). What’s more, climate change is forcing many people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-migrants-destination-cities-data-orlando">to relocate</a>, as well as detrimentally affecting mental health and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nepal-reeling-from-unprecedented-dengue-virus-outbreak">spreading disease</a> as vectors such as mosquitoes shift to new habitats (<em>SN: 5/12/20</em>; <em>SN: 10/7/19</em>).</p>



<p>Adaptation is especially needed in cities, which are growing and expected to contain two-thirds of the world’s population by 2050, including climate refugees from elsewhere, the new report finds. Urban communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat waves, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">urban heat island effects</a>, floods and storm surges (<em>SN: 9/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>Outside of cities, the breakdown of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity severely impacts the people who rely on natural systems for their livelihoods, the report emphasizes. Farmers in the global south are finding it increasingly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">challenging to grow</a> crops as a result of droughts, heat waves, floods and sea-level rise (<em>SN: 9/24/21</em>). People who make their living fishing are being forced to travel greater distances to pursue species that are altering their natural ranges as ocean temperatures warm.</p>



<p>Key to adapting to these impacts is the restoration and preservation of natural ecosystems, the report states. Conserving 30 to 50 percent of the planet’s land, ocean and freshwater ecosystems will <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-will-protecting-30-percent-earth-prevent-extinction-crisis">help support biodiversity</a> and enhance climate resilience (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). Preserving mangrove forests, for instance, along less developed coastlines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangrove-forests-carbon-storage-yucatan-climate">sequesters large amounts of carbon</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-level-rise-mangrove-forests">protects against</a> storm surges (<em>SN:5/7/21,</em> <em>SN:</em> <em>6/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>“The truth is that nature can be our savior,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, at a February 28 news conference announcing the report’s release. “But only if we save it first.”</p>



<p>Still, the natural world and many of the “services” it provides to humankind, such as carbon storage and flood control, begin to break down more rapidly at about 1.5° C above preindustrial temperatures, the report notes. And the window to prevent that from happening is closing. “We are on a trajectory to losing many of these systems and the services they provide” says Borja Reguero, a coastal science researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz who reviewed the report.</p>



<p>What that means is there is no time to waste. “We simultaneously need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to reduce the risks of climate change and also address losses and damages that are already being experienced,” Adelle Thomas, a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas in Nassau, said at a February 27 news briefing. Thomas is the lead author of the new report’s chapter on key risks across sectors and regions.</p>



<p>“And we have a very limited amount of time left to do this,” she stressed.</p>

                <p>In a quiet laboratory beyond the decomposing remains on a body farm in Huntsville, Texas, Noemi Procopio works carefully with her drill.</p>



<p>With each cut she makes into human bones, Procopio removes minuscule amounts of material, collecting some in a tube. That precious powder holds clues to when its donor died and the person’s age at death.</p>



<p>Popular television shows like <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> and its spin-offs may make it seem easy to work out a person’s time of death. But many methods, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forensics-next-tool-hair-collecting-caterpillars">analyzing insects that colonize a corpse</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/08</em>), don’t work for remains that are mostly bare bones. Estimating time since death for skeletal remains currently relies on inspecting the bones for their degree of weathering — a rather subjective measure.</p>





<p>It’s not uncommon for analysts to reach different conclusions for the same bones, says Procopio, a forensic scientist and molecular biotechnologist at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England.</p>



<p>Those difficulties inspired Procopio to look for proteins and other molecules in bones that could provide an objective, dependable way to clock time. She and her colleagues have already identified a handful of candidates. Now, in one of the largest studies of its kind, the team is tracking these timekeeping molecules and searching for others in the cadavers of more than 100 people.</p>



<p>There are a couple of ways that proteins in bones can be used to track time, Procopio has previously found. When certain proteins decay, one of their amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — loses a certain chemical group over months to years. These missing bits can clue researchers in to how long a protein has been decaying. Meanwhile, populations of proteins also change in composition after death.</p>



<p>Even after someone dies, there’s still chemistry going on in the body, says Glendon Parker, a biochemist at the University of California, Davis who is not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Proteomics, the study of the proteins in a cell, organ or other samples, has advanced over the last few decades and yielded new insights into basic biology, Parker says. Given the massive revolution taking place in the field, “it’s only a matter of time before that has an impact on forensic practice.”</p>



<p>Procopio started investigating how bones clock time several years ago, with piglets that had died naturally. She buried their bones and dug them up a year later to scrape off bone powder. An analysis of the powder revealed a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b01070">link between the amount of a protein</a> involved in bone mineralization and the piglets’ ages at death, the researchers reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Proteome Research</em>. Levels of this protein, called fetuin-A, decrease with age.</p>



<p>Procopio then moved on to humans. In a pilot study with four bodies, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00992">the abundances of several proteins</a> in bones, including some that give bones their structure, decreased with time since death, her team reported in 2021 in the same scientific journal.</p>



<p>Procopio’s latest and largest endeavor, part of a U.K. Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship, is ongoing. Her team is sampling the shinbones of 120 cadavers at three body farms in Texas and Tennessee. These people who donated their bodies to science have been dead for a couple of months to several decades.</p>

<p>In addition to surveying protein candidates and searching for other potential protein timers in bones, Procopio’s team is on the lookout for other types of molecules, such as small ones that result from proteins degrading. Together, these molecular clues may give researchers a more accurate and detailed picture of exactly how long a body has been dead and in what sort of environment.</p>



<p>Procopio hopes to eventually incorporate the markers she finds into a computer model or equation that estimates time since death. Such a tool could someday help resolve the world’s backlog of unidentified bodies. In the United States alone, <a href="https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/">some 4,400 unidentified bodies turn up</a> each year, and 1,000 of those remain anonymous after one year, according to the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>The body count is “massive,” Procopio says. “Most of [the bodies] are found in a condition in which they can’t be identified” using current techniques, she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gravity-sensor-atoms-quantum-physics-underground">A new gravity sensor used atoms’ weird quantum behavior to peer underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>The best way to find buried treasure may be with a quantum gravity sensor.</p>



<p>In these devices, free-falling atoms reveal subtle variations in Earth’s gravitational pull at different places. Those variations reflect differences in the density of material beneath the sensor — effectively letting the instrument peer underground. In a new experiment, one of these machines <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04315-3">teased out the tiny gravitational signature of an underground tunnel</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 24 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“Instruments like this would find many, many applications,” says Nicola Poli, an experimental physicist at the University of Florence, who coauthored a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00464-1">commentary on the study</a> in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Poli imagines using quantum gravity sensors to monitor groundwater or magma beneath volcanoes, or to help archaeologists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-void-discovered-great-pyramid-giza">uncover hidden tombs</a> or other artifacts without having to dig them up (<em>SN: 11/2/17</em>). These devices could also help farmers check soil quality or help engineers inspect potential construction sites for unstable ground.</p>



<p>“There are many tools to measure gravity,” says Xuejian Wu, an atomic physicist at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., who wasn’t involved in the study. Some devices measure how far gravity pulls down a mass hanging from a spring. Other tools use lasers to clock how fast an object tumbles down a vacuum chamber. But free-falling atoms, like those in quantum gravity sensors, are the most pristine, reliable test masses out there, Wu says. As a result, quantum sensors promise to be more accurate and stable in the long run than other gravity probes.</p>



<p>Inside a quantum gravity sensor, a cloud of supercooled atoms is dropped down a chute. A pulse of light then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trapping-atoms-laser-beam-offers-new-way-measure-gravity">splits each of the falling atoms into a superposition</a> state — a quantum limbo where each atom exists in two places at once (<em>SN: 11/7/19</em>). Due to their slightly different positions in Earth’s gravitational field, the two versions of each atom feel a different downward tug as they fall. Another light pulse then recombines the split atoms.</p>



<p>Thanks to the atoms’ wave-particle duality — a strange rule of quantum physics that says atoms can act like waves — the reunited atoms <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-particles-gravity-spacetime-aharonov-bohm-effect">interfere with each other</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/22</em>). That is, as the atom waves overlap, their crests and troughs can reinforce or cancel each other out, creating an interference pattern. That pattern reflects the slightly different downward pulls that the split versions of each atom felt as they fell — revealing the gravity field at the atom cloud’s location.</p>



<p>Extremely precise measurements made by such atom-based devices have helped <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-gravity-experiment-atoms-general-relativity-einstein">test Einstein’s theory of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/20</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/key-constants-new-measurement-casts-doubt-dark-photons">measure fundamental constants</a>, such as Newton’s gravitational constant (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). But atom-based gravity sensors are highly sensitive to vibrations from seismic activity, traffic and other sources.</p>



<p>“Even very, very small vibrations create enough noise that you have to measure for a long time” at any location to weed out background tremors, says Michael Holynski, a physicist at the University of Birmingham in England. That has made quantum gravity sensing impractical for many uses outside the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holynski’s team solved that problem by building a gravity sensor with not one but two falling clouds of rubidium atoms. With one cloud suspended a meter above the other, the instrument could gauge the strength of gravity at two different heights in a single location. Comparing those measurements allowed the researchers to cancel out the effects of background noise.</p>



<p>Holynski and colleagues tested whether their sensor — a 2-meter-tall chute on wheels tethered to a rolling cart of equipment — could detect an underground passageway on the University of Birmingham campus. The 2-by-2-meter concrete tunnel lay beneath a road between two multistory buildings. The quantum sensor measured the local gravitational field every 0.5 meters along an 8.5-meter line that crossed over the tunnel. Those readouts matched the predictions of a computer simulation, which had estimated the gravitational signal of the tunnel based on its structure and other factors that could influence the local gravitational field, such as nearby buildings.</p>



<p>Based on the machine’s sensitivity in this experiment, it could probably provide a reliable gravity measurement at each location in less than two minutes, the researchers estimate. That’s about one-tenth the time needed for other types of gravity sensors.</p>



<p>The team has since built a downsized version of the gravity sensor used in the tunnel-detecting experiment. The new machine weighs about 15 kilograms, compared with the 300-kilogram beast used for the tunnel test. Other upgrades could also boost the gravity sensor’s speed.</p>



<p>In the future, engineer Nicole Metje envisions building a quantum gravity sensor that could be pushed from place to place like a lawn mower. But portability isn’t the only challenge for making these tools more user-friendly, says Metje, a coauthor on the study who is also at the University of Birmingham. “At the moment, we still need someone with a physics degree to operate the sensor.”</p>



<p>So hopeful beachcombers may be waiting a long time to trade in their metal detectors for quantum gravity sensors.</p>

The prevailing view in most of the 20th century was that no new neurons are born in the mammalian brain once development ceases. A series of studies in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28altman+j%5BAuthor%5D%29+AND+%28neurogenesis%5BTitle%5D%29&amp;sort=date&amp;sort_order=asc&amp;size=50" target="_blank">the 1960s</a> showed otherwise, but these were ignored  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769695/" target="_blank">until the 1990s</a>. A now-historical paper from 2000 recounted the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35036235" target="_blank">death of a dogma</a>: adult neurogenesis is here to stay, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1198_1313" target="_blank">even in humans</a>. Thousand of studies in animals (mostly rodents) demonstrated that new neurons are born in the dentate gyrus region of the adult hippocampus, and they can play an important role in learning and memory. <br /><br />More recently, several papers have questioned whether adult humans really do generate new neurons in the hippocampus (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25975" target="_blank">Sorrells et al, 2018</a>, <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/12/2554" target="_blank">2021</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627321008667" target="_blank">Franjic et al., 2022</a>). One such paper examined the morphology of dentate gyrus cells taken from post-mortem brains and from tissue surgically removed from epilepsy patients, with ages ranging from prenatal to elderly (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25975" target="_blank">Sorrells et al, 2018</a>).

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Journal editors are like science’s gatekeepers: they decide what gets published and what doesn’t, affecting the careers of other academics and influencing the direction that a field takes. You’d hope, then, that journals would do everything they can to establish a diverse editorial board, reflecting a variety of voices, experiences, and identities.</p>



<p>So a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01012-w">new study</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> makes for disheartening reading. The team finds that the majority of editors in top psychology and neuroscience journals are male and based in the United States: a situation that may be amplifying existing gender inequalities in the field and influencing the kind of research gets published.</p>



<span id="more-45477"></span>



<p>The researchers, led by Eleanor Palser from the University of California, San Francisco, looked at the top 50 journals in both psychology and neuroscience, noting the country of affiliation and gender of the editors at each journal. They classified each editor’s role according to three levels of seniority: editors-in-chief and their deputies; associate and section editors; and editorial and advisory board members.</p>



<p>For comparison, the team also estimated the overall proportion of male and female psychology and neuroscience researchers in the US, based on data from a national survey and conference registrations. They also looked at the geographical spread of senior authors who had recently published in the two fields.</p>



<p>Men accounted for 60% of the editors of psychology journals — significantly more than the 40% of editors who were women. There were more male than female editors at each level of seniority, and men made up the majority of editors in just over three-quarters of the journals. Crucially, the proportion of female editors was significantly lower than the overall proportion of psychology researchers who are women.</p>



<p>In terms of geographical spread, almost <em>all</em> psychology editors — 91% of them — were based in either North America or Europe. In fact, 61% of editors were from the US alone, a significantly higher proportion than you’d expect given that only 45% of senior authors of psychology papers were based in the US.</p>



<p>The differences were even starker in the neuroscience journals: overall, 70% of editors were male, and men held the majority of editorial positions in 88% of journals. In this case, the proportion of female editors was <em>not</em> significantly lower than the proportion of female researchers working in neuroscience — a finding that reveals enduring gender disparities in the field more broadly.</p>



<p>Again, most editors came from either North America or Europe, and 52% came just from the US — significantly more than the 36% of senior authors who were US-based. </p>



<p>Based on their results, the team concludes that “the ideas, values and decision-making biases of men, particularly those from the USA, are overrepresented in the editorial positions of the most recognized academic journals in psychology and neuroscience”.</p>



<p>Gender inequality in science is often attributed to the fact that senior academics are more likely to be male, because historically science was male-dominated: it’s argued that as time goes on and more women rise to senior roles, the field will become more equal. Yet this study showed that even the junior roles in psychology journals tended be held disproportionately by men, despite the fact that there are actually more female than male junior psychology faculty (in the US, at least).</p>



<p>This implies that a lack of female academics is not the problem. Instead, there are structural reasons that women are disadvantaged in science, which could make them less likely to be appointed to editorial boards. Women receive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00387-3">lower salaries</a> and face greater childcare demands, for instance, which can result in fewer publications and grants — the kinds of things that journals look for when deciding who to appoint. Rather than simply blaming the inequality of editorial boards on tradition, we should be actively breaking down these existing barriers.</p>



<p>In neuroscience journals, the proportion of female editors did reflect the gender balance of the field. But this shouldn’t be an excuse not to include more women on those editorial boards as well — instead, it’s a good reason to make sure that these boards <em>are </em>more diverse, providing more opportunities and influence for women in a field that lags behind psychology in terms of gender representation.</p>



<p>A lack of diversity among journal editors also likely contributes to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/29/researchers-assume-white-americans-are-more-representative-of-humankind-than-other-groups-according-to-analysis-of-psychology-paper-titles/">psychology’s WEIRD problem</a>. If journal editors are largely men from the United States, then they will probably place higher value on papers that are relevant to Western, male populations, whether consciously or not. Other work has shown how the identity of editors can influence publishing decisions: for example, over the past few decades, the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/21/episode-23-whose-psychology-is-it-anyway-making-psychological-research-more-representative/">vast majority of editors of top-tier psychology journals have been White</a> — and under White editors, these journals published fewer publications about race.</p>



<p>The current study didn’t consider editors’ race, or indeed other aspects of identity like sexuality or ethnicity — a limitation that the authors acknowledge. Still, it represents an important step towards improving representation among those who hold positions of power in science.</p>

<p>Many men contemplating vasectomies have been depositing a quantity of their semen with sperm banks where, for a fee, it is frozen and stored.… There is wide disagreement on the length of time that sperm may be frozen and then thawed and used successfully to impregnate a woman, with estimates ranging from only 16 months to as much as 10 years.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The ability to freeze sperm has helped make parenthood possible for millions of people, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">infertile or same-sex couples</a> and people who have undergone cancer treatment (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p.&nbsp;16</em>). Sperm-freezing methods have improved since the 1970s, and studies have shown that frozen sperm can remain viable for many years, even decades. The rate of live births from <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(19)30505-9/fulltext">sperm frozen for up to 15 years</a> at a sperm bank in China was similar to rates from sperm stored for much shorter periods, scientists reported in 2019. In 2013, U.S. researchers reported the birth of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3696447/">healthy twins</a> who were conceived using sperm that had been frozen for about 40&nbsp;years.</p>

                <p>Hello there! and welcome once again to my blog.</p>
<p>Outreachy has been one awesome experience I don't want to come to an end and it won't because I'll continue contributing to Fedora and open source. </p>
<p>So far I've completed lots of projects and gained a hand full of skills and from a large organization.</p>
<p>I've gained experience in Python programming, building software from source, RPM building, testing quality assurance, GIT and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>I've successfully built so many softwares for the Fedora OS like; python-pooch, Shybrid, pyhton-astor, python-glymur, python-mne and lots <a href="https://pagure.io/dashboard/projects">more</a>
I've edited Fedora docs 😄, I am a member of the NeuroFedora team and a part of Fedora as a whole ❤️. </p>
<p>I got to meet expereienced programmers and the best mentors.</p>
<p>I most definitely will not let all this knowledge go to waste, I will continue to contribute to Fedora and improve FOSS.</p>
<p>I can't believe how much I've achieved in this short time.</p>
<p>Outreachy is the best ❤️</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-clostridioides-difficile-antibiotics-chain-mail-armor-shield">A chain mail–like armor may shield C. difficile from some antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chain mail–like armor may help keep one superbug safe from bacteria-killing medicines.</p>



<p><em>Clostridioides difficile </em>bacteria are notorious for taking over the guts of people who have taken antibiotics to treat other infections. If the antibiotic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poop-transplant-pills-treat-intestinal-infection">clears out too many good bacteria</a>, the loss can throw the gut’s microbial system out of whack and allow diarrhea-causing <em>C. difficile </em>to take over (<em>SN: 10/16/14</em>). And <em>C. difficile </em>itself is resistant to many antibiotics, making the nearly half a million infections in the United States each year hard to treat.</p>



<p>That antibiotic resistance may arise because the medicines have a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28196-w">tough time breaking through the superbug’s nearly impenetrable outer barrier</a>, researchers report February 25 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That barrier, called the S-layer, can also prevent penetration of an enzyme that host cells make to kill bacteria, preventing death of the infectious invader.</p>





<p>Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, structural microbiologist Paula Salgado of Newcastle University in England and colleagues zeroed in on the main protein that makes up <em>C. difficile</em>’s S-layer, called SlpA. The closeup view revealed tightly linked proteins with minuscule gaps that looked like medieval knights’ chain mail. Because the gaps are so small, few molecules (such as antibiotics) can pass through. <em>C. diff</em>’s outer barrier is “flexible, but strong at the same time,” Salgado says.</p>

<p>Removing a region of the S-layer called D2 made <em>C. diff</em> cells susceptible to lysozyme, an enzyme typically found in saliva that tears open microbes’ exteriors, the team found.</p>



<p>Understanding how SlpA forms the S-layer could help researchers find new ways — such as poking holes in its chain mail — to treat <em>C. difficile</em> infections, which can come back time and time again. One out of six people <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cdiff/what-is.html">have a second infection</a>. “If we have drugs to target <em>C. diff </em>specifically,” Salgado says, “then [we could] break that cycle.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-children-parent-caregiver-loss-death-5-million">More than 5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>An estimated 5.2 million children worldwide have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19.</p>



<p>The tally covers the beginning of the pandemic through October 2021, during which there were about 5 million deaths globally from COVID-19. With each reported death, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(22)00005-0/fulltext">at least one child became orphaned — losing one or both parents — or experienced the loss of a caregiver</a>, such as a grandparent or other adult relative that lived in the home, researchers report online February 24 in the <em>Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<p>Of the more than 3 million children who became orphans, just over 2 million were 10 to 17 years old, nearly 740,000 were ages 5 to 9, and almost 500,000 were 4 years old or younger. Close to 800,000 children lost their mothers. The fathers of more than 2.5 million children died of COVID-19.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Staggering loss<br></h3>



<p>From May through October 2021, the estimated number of children who lost a parent or caregiver from COVID-19 nearly doubled, from 2.7 million to 5.2 million.</p>

<p>The international research team’s calculations are based on an analysis of reported COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths that occurred during the pandemic (those beyond what would be expected without a pandemic) and other data from 21 countries.</p>



<p>Previously, the team had estimated that from March 2020 through April 2021, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">1.5 million children lost a parent or caregiver</a> as a result of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>). The researchers adjusted that total to 2.7 million, based on updated mortality data. That means that over the six months from May through October 2021, the number of children who lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-19 almost doubled, from 2.7 million to 5.2 million.</p>

<p>The death of a parent or caregiver can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/epidemics-infectious-disease-polio-flu-vaccine-aftermath-race">harm the long-term health and well-being of children</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). “Our findings suggest an urgent need for pandemic responses to prioritize children affected by deaths of parents and caregivers,” the researchers write, with approaches tailored to the age- and circumstance-dependent risks that children face. For example, studies have found that orphaned adolescents are more likely to leave school and report symptoms of depression than those who aren’t orphans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">The COVID-19 pandemic is not an on-off switch</a></h4>

              
                <p>During the winter surge of COVID-19, it felt like the coronavirus was everywhere. Colder weather pushed people inside <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">where the virus can linger in the air</a>, and the surge-dominating omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had the troublesome ability to dodge some immune responses (<em>SN</em>: 5/18/21). That meant that <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status">both vaccinated</a> or previously infected people were more susceptible to getting infected than they were with previous coronavirus variants. Perhaps that shouldn’t have been a surprise given the vaccines’ primary goal is to prevent severe disease and death (not to prevent infection at all, what’s called sterilizing immunity). Still, omicron caught everyone off guard.</p>



<p>Finally, weeks after COVID-19 cases skyrocketed, they continue to trend downward in most parts of the United States and around the world. Every time cases drop, I find myself holding my breath, hoping that signs of a resurgence won’t appear. So far, so good — for now. I might be able to let that breath out soon, for at least a bit. (Although cases in New Jersey, where I live, appear to be plateauing at levels close to the peak of last summer’s delta wave.)</p>



<p>The bulk of the winter COVID-19 cases were caused a subvariant of omicron dubbed BA.1. Researchers are now keeping an eye on its close sibling, an omicron subvariant called BA.2. Even as cases decrease overall, BA.2 is <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">on the rise</a>, accounting for an estimated 4 percent of new cases in the United States for the week ending February 19.</p>

<p>BA.2 concerns researchers because it is slightly more transmissible than BA.1, which could extend the current surge, and it also has some different mutations than BA.1. Both BA.1 and BA.2 can evade immune responses by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">dodging virus-attacking antibodies</a> sparked by vaccination or infection with other variants, and some of BA.2’s differences might mean it could evade antibodies made after a BA.1 infection (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). So far, that’s not what scientists are seeing. Instead, even though these types of reinfections can happen, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271112v1">they are rare</a>, a team from Europe reports in a preliminary study posted February 22 at medRxiv.org. Reinfections with BA.2, the team found, were most common in young, unvaccinated people who weren’t hospitalized. Time will tell how long this protection holds up and how it might fare against future variants or subvariants.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve worried about reinfections. An eon ago in pandemic time, in early 2021, the emergence of the alpha, beta and gamma variants sparked concerns that more people might soon be faced with a second bout of COVID-19. So in February of last year, I interviewed epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to hear her thoughts on<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-variants-reinfection-vaccination-efforts"> what variants might mean for the pandemic at large</a> (<em>SN</em>: 2/5/21).</p>



<p>Back then, our understanding of reinfections was in its infancy. Studies hinted that the beta and gamma variants could evade parts of the immune system, making reinfections possible. But we didn’t know how common reinfections were or if a second bout of COVID-19 might be less severe than the first. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout in the United States was inching along, with many people desperately seeking first doses. Last year, Gordon, who has been studying coronavirus reinfections, told me that the new variants might prolong the pandemic. But she was quick to remind me that even in the face of variants, pandemics always end.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to February 2022. Vaccines are more broadly available (although there are still access issues and some people don’t want the shots), and we’re certainly no spring chickens when it comes to face-offs with new variants. But because the pandemic is a time warp, I decided to catch up with Gordon now to see if her thinking has changed since February 2021. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What have we learned about reinfection over the past year? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One of the things that we’ve learned about reinfection or [vaccine] breakthroughs is that once people have that second exposure — be that their first is vaccination and their second is infection or their first is infection and second is vaccination — people generate “hybrid immunity.” People are generating a broader [immune] response which is going to help protect them against future infections. It’s not going to be sterilizing immunity against all variants that arise, but it’s certainly going to help reduce the probability that people get infected or reinfected with every variant. And when they do get reinfected, they will be more mild infections.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Last year, you said that we may or may not need booster shots. What are your thoughts now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Our perception of boosters has completely changed. It became evident that boosters would help. They would help to curb transmission. They would help to reduce severity for people who do have breakthrough infections. I think it’s generally felt that there’s a need for an omicron-specific booster because getting vaccinated and boosted with the original strain of the virus is not very effective at preventing infections with omicron.</p>



<p>We need to look toward the future. I think one of the big questions with an omicron-specific booster is going to be what effect will that booster have on somebody who’s already been vaccinated or even vaccinated and boosted previously. Is it just boosting immunity to omicron? Or do you see them develop broader immunity? Through boosting with a different variant, you might generate broader immunity to protect not only against omicron but also briefly protect against any future variants that circulate.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: As states drop mask mandates, there&#8217;s talk that we are exiting the pandemic phase of this viral outbreak. Is that true?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think completely letting go of control at this point would be a mistake. We’re not through it, we’re not at the endemic level [when the virus normally circulates at some baseline amount]. But I do think we are in a transition period.</p>



<p>If you look back at flu pandemics, for example, there has been a transition period: The first year or two with a very heavy toll, but then beyond that, [transmission] typically stays higher for a few years. I think at this point, we’re in a stage where most countries — not every single country but in most — a majority of the population has some level of immunity. What the transition period looks like for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, really depends on the severity of infections and how many exposures do we need to get down to whatever an endemic level is. Certainly, one exposure seems to have really reduced severity, but maybe that didn’t get it down to the endemic level where you’ve grown up being exposed to this virus your entire life. The length of that transition period and how painful it is, is really going to depend on the severity of reinfections that occur over time.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What will the endemic phase of the pandemic look like?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Endemic is a period where the virus has hit a “normal level.” You’ve got a high level of population immunity, and [the virus] still causes some specific level of severe disease. We don’t know what that looks like yet. We don’t know if, in the endemic phase, the severity of this virus is going to look like a seasonal coronavirus [that causes a cold] or if it’s going to look more like the severity of influenza [which can kill tens of thousands of people on average per year in the United States] or more severe than influenza. We actually need to get to where it’s at an endemic level before we know all of that.</p>



<p>And the other thing is the rates of infection. We know for seasonal coronaviruses that people get reinfected really often — on average probably about every three years but it can happen as soon as six months after, even in people who’ve been exposed to it throughout their entire lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, the entire population was naïve to this new coronavirus. We’ve been building immunity over time, so transmission stays quite high. That’s going to slow down as people build up immunity, but we’ll see. We may have a need for annual boosters or regular boosters. We might be able to come up with a more broadly protective vaccine that lasts for longer — that would be fantastic.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Do you feel more optimistic or pessimistic than last year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Honestly, I’m about the same. The only thing that made me a bit pessimistic … was in studies we’ve done in Nicaragua. We got a big wave in 2020, about 60 percent of the population in that study got infected. Then we went forward and had another large wave in 2021, probably of gamma and delta. One thing that made me a little more pessimistic about the situation was that the<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.23.21266767v1"> severity of repeat infections was higher</a> than I expected it to be … but I always thought that people needed at least two exposures [to the virus] before we get anywhere near an endemic level. Maybe even more than two, we don’t really know. We’ve got omicron in Nicaragua now, so we have a large population that has had two or three exposures already because a bunch of them are vaccinated now, too. We’ll see what happens during this omicron wave.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: We all really want this to be over. How will we know?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think people are confused about when a pandemic ends. As I said, it’s a transition period. Instead of thinking of it as a dimmer switch — at the top is pandemic and then you slide down to the bottom which is endemic — people want it to be an off-on switch. Like “oh it’s a pandemic, and now it’s over. We’re in an endemic phase.” But unfortunately, we’re not there yet. We are going to slowly slide toward an endemic phase.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper &quot;Using Head-Mounted Ethanol Sensors to Monitor Olfactory Information and Determine Behavioral Changes Associated with Ethanol-Plume Contact during Mouse Odor-Guided Navigation&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Olfaction guides navigation and decision-making in organisms from
multiple animal phyla. Understanding how animals use olfactory cues to
guide navigation is a complicated problem for two main reasons. First,
the sensory cues used to guide animals to the source of an odor
consist of volatile molecules, which form plumes. These plumes are
governed by turbulent air currents, resulting in an intermittent and
spatiotemporally varying olfactory signal. A second problem is that
the technologies for chemical quantification are cumbersome and cannot
be used to detect what the freely moving animal senses in real time.
Understanding how the olfactory system guides this behavior requires
knowing the sensory cues and the accompanying brain signals during
navigation. Here, we present a method for real-time monitoring of
olfactory information using low-cost, lightweight sensors that
robustly detect common solvent molecules, like alcohols, and can be
easily mounted on the heads of freely behaving mice engaged in odor-
guided navigation. To establish the accuracy and temporal response
properties of these sensors we compared their responses with those of
a photoionization detector (PID) to precisely controlled ethanol
stimuli. Ethanol-sensor recordings, deconvolved using a difference-of-
exponentials kernel, showed robust correlations with the PID signal at
behaviorally relevant time, frequency, and spatial scales.
Additionally, calcium imaging of odor responses from the olfactory
bulbs (OBs) of awake, head-fixed mice showed strong correlations with
ethanol plume contacts detected by these sensors. Finally, freely
behaving mice engaged in odor-guided navigation showed robust
behavioral changes such as speed reduction that corresponded to
ethanol plume contacts.</p>

Thus, the elimination of these compounds is an important process. The authors of this study tested tow polymer membranes as an extractive membrane to not only remove, but also recover paracetamol from aquatic solution. They conclude that their process is a clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly method to remove the compound from aquatic environments and recover this high-value substance.</p>

This study investigates how chronotypes, intra-organismal differences in these daily rhythms, are linked to age and cast-associated behavior. Brood-tending nurse ants show a constant activity, whereas forager ants show daily rhythms in activity. These tasks can shift depending on the absence of a brood or other requirements. Investigations into how daily gene expression differences could underlie behavioral plasticity were conducted using time-course behavioral assays and RNA-sequencing of carpenter ants. This study showed that such chronobiological plasticity has evolved to allow for distinct regulatory networks for distinct behavioral roles, while allowing transitions in response to colony demands.</p>

Antimalarial drugs are frequently administered at Ebola Treatment Units and there is some evidence that these are beneficial for patients. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the association between antimalarial treatment and reduced mortality in patients where Ebola virus disease has been confirmed during the 2014-16 Malaria epidemic in West Africa. The study could demonstrate that early oral administration of antimalarial treatment could reduce the mortality of Ebola virus patients significantly.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Some romantic relationships slot into place easily: we meet, we get together, and we stay together, at least for a while. Others are far more tumultuous, as we break up and get back together over and over again — often to the frustration and annoyance of those we confide in.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that such relationships can cause us distress, and this is the subject of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/fare.12614">new study</a>, published in <em>Family Relations.</em> It looks at the impact of on-off relationships, finding not only short-term harm but longer-term implications too.</p>



<span id="more-45467"></span>



<p>The team gathered data from 545 participants of various sexualities over the course of 15 months, all of whom were in romantic relationships. In the first wave of the study, participants indicated whether or not they had broken up and got back together with their current partner — and, if so, how many times. At all four waves, participants also reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, and at one or more points completed measures of physical violence within the relationship, how satisfied they were in their relationship, and the extent to which they experienced feelings of uncertainty within the relationship.</p>



<p>Breaking up and getting back together was fairly common: 33.6% of participants reported having done so in their current relationship. Those who experienced more frequent break-ups and reconciliations reported more psychological distress at the start of the study — and a greater <em>increase</em> in distress across the different waves. This remained the case when controlling for other measures such as violence and uncertainty, suggesting a direct link between relationship “cycling” and distress.      </p>



<p>So, not only does relationship cycling seem to be distressing in the short-term, it may also have a longer-term impact. The team suggests that feelings of chaos or turbulence lead to these distressing feelings, increasing a sense of instability that can trigger poor mental health. However, it’s important to note questions of cause and effect: those who felt distressed or chaotic might be re-entering relationships in order to make themselves feel better rather than being distressed by the cycling itself. How mental health or distress affects our decisions in relationships, in other words, is also worth looking at.</p>



<p>There is also evidence that serious issues at the start of relationships can endure, “foreshadowing” later outcomes in the relationship: one study found that premarital relationship cycling could impact on people’s confidence in their choice to get married and on satisfaction within that marriage, as well as making trial separation more likely. Future research could explore the links between relationship cycling and the ultimate outcomes of relationships.</p>



<p>The findings don’t mean that on-again off-again relationships never work out: as lead author Kale Monk <a href="https://education.missouri.edu/2022/01/on-again-off-again-relationships-can-have-a-long-lasting-negative-impact-on-couples-mental-health-mu-research-finds/">puts it</a>: “In some of our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407519883701">other studies</a>, we certainly do hear from partners who report that time apart made them realize how much they valued each other and they were rededicated to making it work.” However, thinking carefully about the links between your mental health and your dating patterns may be a worthwhile part of your wellbeing in relationships.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/computer-science-history-ethics-future-robots-ai">Now that computers connect us all, for better and worse, what’s next?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">This article was written, edited and designed on laptop computers. Such foldable, transportable devices would have astounded computer scientists just a few decades ago, and seemed like sheer magic before that. The machines contain billions of tiny computing elements, running millions of lines of software instructions, collectively written by countless people across the globe. You click or tap or type or speak, and the result seamlessly appears on the screen.</p>



<p>Computers were once so large they filled rooms. Now they’re everywhere and invisible, embedded in watches, car engines, cameras, televisions and toys. They manage electrical grids, analyze scientific data and predict the weather. The modern world would be impossible without them.</p>



<p>Scientists aim to make computers faster and programs more intelligent, while deploying technology in an ethical manner. Their efforts build on more than a century of innovation.</p>



<p>In 1833, English mathematician Charles Babbage conceived a programmable machine that presaged today’s computing architecture, featuring a “store” for holding numbers, a “mill” for operating on them, an instruction reader and a printer. This Analytical Engine also had logical functions like branching (if X, then Y). Babbage constructed only a piece of the machine, but based on its description, his acquaintance Ada Lovelace saw that the numbers it might manipulate could represent anything, even music. “A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis,” she wrote. Lovelace became an expert in the proposed machine’s operation and is often called the first programmer.</p>

<p>In 1936, English mathematician Alan Turing introduced the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mind-math">idea of a computer that could rewrite its own instructions</a>, making it endlessly programmable. His mathematical abstraction could, using a small vocabulary of operations, mimic a machine of any complexity, earning it the name “universal Turing machine.”</p>



<p>The first reliable electronic digital computer, Colossus, was completed in 1943 to help England decipher wartime codes. It used vacuum tubes — devices for controlling the flow of electrons — instead of moving mechanical parts like the Analytical Engine’s cogwheels. This made Colossus fast, but engineers had to manually rewire it every time they wanted to perform a new task.</p>



<p>Perhaps inspired by Turing’s concept of a more easily reprogrammable computer, the team that created the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/adds-15000-second">United States’ first electronic digital computer</a>, ENIAC, drafted a new architecture for its successor, EDVAC. Mathematician John von Neumann, who penned EDVAC’s design in 1945, described a system that could store programs in its memory alongside data and alter the programs, a setup now called the von Neumann architecture. Nearly every computer today follows that paradigm.</p>



<p>In 1947, researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vacuum-tube-has-rival">invented the transistor</a>, a piece of circuitry in which the application of voltage (electrical pressure) or current controls the flow of electrons between two points. It came to replace the slower and less-efficient vacuum tubes.</p>



<p>In 1958 and 1959, researchers at Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor independently invented integrated circuits, in which transistors and their supporting circuitry were fabricated on a chip in one process.</p>



<p>For a long time, only experts could program computers. Then in 1957, IBM released FORTRAN, a programming language that was much easier to understand. It’s still in use today. In 1981, the company unveiled the IBM PC, and Microsoft released its operating system called MS-DOS, together expanding the reach of computers into homes and offices. Apple further personalized computing with the operating systems for their Lisa, in 1982, and Macintosh, in 1984. Both systems popularized graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, offering users a mouse cursor instead of a command line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, researchers had been working to transform how people communicate with each other. In 1948, U.S. mathematician Claude Shannon published “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6773024">A Mathematical Theory of Communication</a>,” which popularized the word <em>bit</em> (for binary digit) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/claude-shannon-information-theory-digital-era">and laid the foundation for information theory</a>. His ideas have shaped computation and in particular the sharing of data over wires and through the air. In 1969, the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency created a computer network called ARPANET, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/highways-information">later merged with other networks</a> to form the internet. And in 1990, researchers at CERN — a European laboratory near Geneva — developed rules for transmitting data that would become the foundation of the World Wide Web.</p>



<p>These technological advances have made it possible for people to work, play and connect in ways that continue to change at a dizzying pace. But how much better can the processors get? How smart can algorithms become? And what kinds of benefits and dangers should we expect to see as technology advances? Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who coauthored a popular textbook on artificial intelligence, sees great potential for computers in “expanding artistic creativity, accelerating science, serving as diligent personal assistants, driving cars and — I hope — not killing us.”</p>



<h4>Chasing speed</h4>



<p>Computers, for the most part, speak the language of bits. They store information — whether it’s music, an application or a password — in strings of 1s and 0s. They also process information in a binary fashion, flipping transistors between an “on” and “off” state. The more transistors in a computer, the faster it can process bits, making possible everything from more realistic video games to safer air traffic control.</p>



<p>Combining transistors forms one of the building blocks of a circuit, called a logic gate. An AND logic gate, for example, is on if both inputs are on, while an OR is on if at least one input is on. Together, logic gates compose a complex traffic pattern of electrons, the physical manifestation of computation. A computer chip can contain millions of logic gates.</p>



<p>So the more logic gates, and by extension the more transistors, the more powerful the computer. In 1965, Gordon Moore, a cofounder of Fairchild Semiconductor and later of Intel, wrote a <a href="http://www.computer-architecture.org/textual/Moore-Cramming-More-Components-1965.pdf">paper on the future of chips</a> titled “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits.” From 1959 to 1965, he noted, the number of components (mostly transistors) crammed onto integrated circuits (chips) had doubled every year. He expected the trend to continue.</p>



<p>In a 1975 talk, Moore identified three factors behind this exponential growth: smaller transistors, bigger chips and “device and circuit cleverness,” such as less wasted space. He expected the doubling to occur every two years. It did, and continued doing so for decades. That trend is now called Moore’s law.</p>



<p>Moore’s law was meant as an observation about economics. There will always be incentives to make computers faster and cheaper — but at some point, physics interferes. Chip development can’t keep up with Moore’s law forever, as it becomes more difficult to make transistors tinier. According to what’s jokingly called Moore’s second law, the cost of chip fabrication plants doubles every few years. The semiconductor company TSMC is reportedly considering building a plant that will cost $25 billion.</p>



<p>Today, Moore’s law no longer holds; doubling is happening at a slower rate. We continue to squeeze more transistors onto chips with each generation, but the generations come less frequently. Researchers are looking into several ways forward: better transistors, more specialized chips, new chip concepts and software hacks.</p>



<p>“We’ve squeezed, we believe, everything you can squeeze” out of the current transistor architecture, called FinFET, says Sanjay Natarajan, who leads transistor design at Intel. In the next few years, chip manufacturers will start producing transistors in which a key element resembles a ribbon instead of a fin, making devices faster and requiring less energy and space.</p>



<p>Even if Natarajan is right and transistors are nearing their minimum size limit, computers still have a lot of runway to improve, through Moore’s “device and circuit cleverness.” Today’s electronic devices contain many kinds of accelerators — chips designed for special purposes such as AI, graphics or communication — that can execute intended tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose processing units.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>The slowdown&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Until about 2004, the shrinking of transistors came with improvements in computer performance (black below shows an industry benchmark) and clock frequency — the number of cycles of operations performed per second (green). As this “Dennard scaling” no longer held, shrinking transistors stopped yielding the same benefits.</p>

<p>Some types of accelerators might one day use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computing</a>, which capitalizes on two features of the subatomic realm (<em>SN: 7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 28</em>). The first is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quantum-bits">superposition</a>, in which particles can exist not just in one state or another, but in some combination of states until the state is explicitly measured. So a quantum system represents information not as bits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quarter-century-ago-qubit-was-born">but as qubits</a>, which can preserve the possibility of being either 0 or 1 when measured. The second is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/everyday-entanglement">entanglement</a>, the interdependence between distant quantum elements. Together, these features mean that a system of qubits can represent and evaluate exponentially more possibilities than there are qubits — all combinations of 1s and 0s simultaneously.</p>



<p>Qubits can take many forms, but one of the most popular is as current in superconducting wires. These wires must be kept at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, around –273° Celsius, to prevent hot, jiggling atoms from interfering with the qubits’ delicate superpositions and entanglement. Quantum computers also need many physical qubits to make up one “logical,” or effective, qubit, with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">redundancy acting as error correction</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Quantum computers have several potential applications: machine learning, optimization of things like train scheduling and simulating real-world quantum mechanics, as in chemistry. But they will not likely become general-purpose computers. It’s not clear how you’d use one to, say, run a word processor.</p>



<h4>New chip concepts</h4>



<p>There remain new ways to dramatically speed up not just specialized accelerators but also general-purpose chips. Tom Conte, a computer scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta who leads the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative, points to two paradigms. The first is superconduction, in which chips run at a temperature low enough to eliminate electrical resistance.</p>



<p>The second paradigm is reversible computing, in which bits are reused instead of expelled as heat. In 1961, IBM <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/quantum-interpretations-feel-heat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physicist Rolf Landauer merged information theory and thermodynamics</a>, the physics of heat. He noted that when a logic gate takes in two bits and outputs one, it destroys a bit, expelling it as entropy, or randomness, in the form of heat. When billions of transistors operate at billions of cycles per second, the wasted heat adds up, and the machine needs more electricity for computing and cooling. Michael Frank, a computer scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque who works on reversible computing, wrote in 2017: “A conventional computer is, essentially, an expensive electric heater that happens to perform a small amount of computation as a side effect.”</p>



<p>But in reversible computing, logic gates have as many outputs as inputs. This means that if you ran the logic gate in reverse, you could use, say, three out-bits to obtain the three in-bits. Some researchers have conceived of reversible logic gates and circuits that could not only save those extra out-bits but also recycle them for other calculations. Physicist Richard Feynman had concluded that, aside from energy loss during data transmission, there’s no theoretical limit to computing efficiency.</p>



<p>Combine reversible and superconducting computing, Conte says, and “you get a double whammy.” Efficient computing allows you to run more operations on the same chip without worrying about power use or heat generation. Conte says that, eventually, one or both of these methods “probably will be the backbone of a lot of computing.”</p>





<h4>Software hacks</h4>



<p>Researchers continue to work on a cornucopia of new technologies for transistors, other computing elements, chip designs and hardware paradigms: photonics, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetic-logic-electron-spins-could-do-cool-calculations">spintronics</a>, biomolecules, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chip-carbon-nanotubes-not-silicon-marks-computing-milestone">carbon nanotubes</a>. But much more can still be eked out of current elements and architectures merely by optimizing code.</p>



<p>In a 2020 paper in <em>Science</em>, for instance, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/eaam9744.full">researchers studied the simple problem of multiplying two matrices</a>, grids of numbers used in mathematics and machine learning. The calculation ran more than 60,000 times faster when the team picked an efficient programming language and optimized the code for the underlying hardware, compared with a standard piece of code in the Python language, which is considered user-friendly and easy to learn.</p>



<p>Neil Thompson, a research scientist at MIT who coauthored the paper in <em>Science</em>, recently coauthored a paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9540991">looking at historical improvements in algorithm</a>s, sets of instructions that make decisions according to rules set by humans, for tasks like sorting data. “For a substantial minority of algorithms,” he says, “their progress has been as fast or faster than Moore’s law.”</p>



<p>People, including Moore, have predicted the end of Moore’s law for decades. Progress may have slowed, but human innovation has kept technology moving at a fast clip.</p>



<h4>Chasing intelligence&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>From the early days of computer science, researchers have aimed to replicate human thought. Alan Turing opened a 1950 paper titled “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>” with: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ ” He proceeded to outline a test, which he called “the imitation game” (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mind-math">now called the Turing test</a>), in which a human communicating with a computer and another human via written questions had to judge which was which. If the judge failed, the computer could presumably think.</p>



<p>The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in a 1955 proposal for a summer institute at Dartmouth College. “An attempt will be made,” the proposal goes, “to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.” The organizers expected that over two months, the 10 summit attendees would make a “significant advance.”</p>



<p>More than six decades and untold person-hours later, it’s unclear whether the advances live up to what was in mind at that summer summit. Artificial intelligence surrounds us in ways invisible (filtering spam), headline-worthy (self-driving cars, beating us at chess) and in between (letting us chat with our smartphones). But these are all narrow forms of AI, performing one or two tasks well. What Turing and others had in mind is called artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Depending on your definition, it’s a system that can do most of what humans do.</p>

<p>We may never achieve AGI, but the path has led, and will lead, to lots of useful innovations along the way. “I think we’ve made a lot of progress,” says Doina Precup, a computer scientist at McGill University in Montreal and head of the AI company DeepMind’s Montreal research team. “But one of the things that, to me, is still missing right now is more of an understanding of the principles that are fundamental in intelligence.”</p>



<p>AI has made great headway in the last decade, much of it due to machine learning. Previously, computers relied more heavily on symbolic AI, which uses algorithms based on human-set rules. Machine-learning programs, on the other hand, process data to find patterns on their own. One form uses artificial neural networks, software with layers of simple computing elements that together mimic certain principles of biological brains. Neural networks with several, or many more, layers are currently popular and make up a type of machine learning called deep learning.</p>



<p>Deep-learning systems can now play games like chess and Go better than the best human. They can probably identify dog breeds from photos better than you can. They can translate text from one language to another. They can control robots and <a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/artificial-intelligence-musical-creativity/">compose music</a> and predict how proteins will fold.</p>



<p>But they also lack much of what falls under the umbrella term of common sense. They don’t understand fundamental things about how the world works, physically or socially. Slightly changing images in a way that you or I might not notice, for example, can dramatically affect what a computer sees. Researchers found that placing a few innocuous <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/turtle-or-rifle-hackers-easily-fool-ais-seeing-wrong-thing">stickers on a stop sign</a> can lead software to interpret the sign as a speed limit sign, an obvious <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/when-it-comes-self-driving-cars-whats-safe-enough">problem for self-driving cars</a>.</p>

<h4>Types of learning</h4>



<p>How can AI improve? Computer scientists are leveraging multiple forms of machine learning, whether the learning is “deep” or not. One common form is called supervised learning, in which machine-learning systems, or models, are trained by being fed labeled data such as images of dogs and their breed names. But that requires lots of human effort to label them. Another approach is unsupervised or self-supervised learning, in which computers learn without relying on outside labels, the way you or I predict what a chair will look like from different angles as we walk around it.</p>



<p>Another type of machine learning is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-learns-playing-video-games-starcraft-minecraft">reinforcement learning</a>, in which a model interacts with an environment, exploring sequences of actions to achieve a goal. Reinforcement learning has allowed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphago-artificial-intelligence-top-science-stories-2016">AI to become an expert at board games like Go</a> and video games like <em>StarCraft II</em>.</p>



<p>To learn efficiently, machines (and people) need to generalize, to draw abstract principles from experiences. “A huge part of intelligence,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, “is being able to take one’s knowledge and apply it in different situations.” Much of her work involves analogies, in rudimentary form: finding similarities between strings of letters. In 2019, AI researcher François Chollet of Google created a kind of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai">IQ test for machines</a> called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, or ARC, in which computers must complete visual patterns according to principles demonstrated in example patterns. The puzzles are easy for humans, but so far, challenging for machines.</p>



<p>Much of our abstract thought, ironically, may be grounded in our physical experiences. We use conceptual metaphors like important = big, and argument = opposing forces. To realize AGI that can do most of what humans can do may require embodiment, such as operating with a physical robot. Researchers have <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2020/teaching-robots-to-talk">combined language learning and robotics</a> by creating virtual worlds where virtual robots simultaneously learn to follow instructions and to navigate within a house.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is a trained language model released in 2020 by the research lab Open AI that has shown that disembodied language may not be enough. With prompts, it can write humanlike news articles, short stories and poems. But in <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">one demo, it wrote:</a> “It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.”</p>



<p>“I’ve played around a lot with it,” Mitchell says. “It does incredible things. But it can also make some incredibly dumb mistakes.”</p>



<p>AGI might also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/will-to-survive-might-take-artificial-intelligence-next-level">require other aspects of our animal nature, like emotions</a>, especially if humans expect to interact with machines in natural ways<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201501/beyond-happiness-the-upside-feeling-down">. Emotions are not mere irrational reactions</a>. We’ve evolved them to guide our drives and behaviors. According to Ilya Sutskever, a cofounder and the chief scientist at OpenAI, they “give us this extra oomph of wisdom.” Even if AI doesn’t have the same conscious feelings we do, it may have <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers">code that approximates fear</a> or anger. Already, reinforcement learning includes an<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-imbue-robots-curiosity"> exploratory element akin to curiosity</a>.</p>

<p>Humans aren’t blank slates. We’re born with certain predispositions to recognize faces, learn language and play with objects. Machine-learning systems also require the right kind of innate structure to learn certain things quickly. How much structure, and what kind, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-researchers-are-teaching-ai-learn-child">is a matter of intense debate</a>. Sutskever says building in how we think we think is “intellectually seductive.” However, “we want the best blank slate.”</p>



<p>One general neural-network structure Sutskever likes is called the transformer, a method for paying greater attention to important relationships between elements of an input. It’s behind current language models like GPT-3, and has also been applied to analyzing images, audio and video. “It makes everything better,” he says.</p>



<h4>Thinking about thinking</h4>



<p>AI itself may help us discover new forms of AI. There’s a set of techniques called AutoML, in which algorithms help optimize neural-network architectures or other aspects of AI models. AI also helps chip architects design better integrated circuits. Last year, Google researchers reported in <em>Nature</em> that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w">reinforcement learning performed better than their in-house team</a> at laying out some aspects of an accelerator chip they’d designed.</p>



<p>AGI’s arrival may be decades away. “We don’t understand our own intelligence,” Mitchell says, as much of it is unconscious. “And therefore, we don’t know what’s going to be hard or easy for AI.” What seems hard can be easy and vice versa — a phenomenon known as Moravec’s paradox, after the roboticist Hans Moravec. In 1988, Moravec wrote, “it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a 1-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.” Babies are secretly brilliant. In aiming for AGI, Precup says, “we are also understanding more about human intelligence, and about intelligence in general.”</p>



<p>Turing differentiated between general intelligence and humanlike intelligence. In his 1950 paper on the imitation game, he wrote, “May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?” His point: You don’t need to think like a person to have genuine smarts.</p>



<h4>Grappling with ethics</h4>



<p>In the 1942 short story “Runaround,” one of Isaac Asimov’s characters enumerated “the three fundamental Rules of Robotics.” Robots avoided causing or allowing harm to humans, they obeyed orders and they protected themselves, as long as following one rule didn’t conflict with preceding decrees.</p>



<p>We might picture Asimov’s “positronic brains” making autonomous decisions about harm to humans, but that’s not actually how computers affect our well-being every day. Instead of humanoid robots killing people, we have algorithms curating news feeds. As computers further infiltrate our lives, we’ll need to think harder about what kinds of systems to build and how to deploy them, as well as meta-problems like how to decide — and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/who-should-stop-unethical-ai">who should decide</a> — these things.</p>



<p>This is the realm of ethics, which may seem distant from the supposed objectivity of math, science and engineering. But deciding what questions to ask about the world and what tools to build has always depended on our ideals and scruples. Studying an abstruse topic like the innards of atoms, for instance, has clear bearing on both energy and weaponry. “There’s the fundamental fact that computer systems are not value neutral,” says computer scientist Barbara Grosz of Harvard University, “that when you design them, you bring some set of values into that design.”</p>



<p>One topic that has received a lot of attention from scientists and ethicists is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machines-are-getting-schooled-fairness">fairness and bias</a>. Algorithms increasingly inform or even dictate decisions about hiring, college admissions, loans and parole. Even if they discriminate less than people do, they can still treat certain groups unfairly, not by design but often because they are trained on biased data. They might predict a person’s future criminal behavior based on prior arrests, for instance, even though different groups are arrested at different rates for a given amount of crime.</p>



<p>And confusingly, there are multiple definitions of fairness, such as equal false-positive rates between groups or equal false-negative rates between groups. A researcher at one conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqamrPkF5kk">listed 21 definitions</a>. And the definitions often conflict. In one paper, researchers showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807">in most cases it’s mathematically impossible to satisfy three common definitions simultaneously</a>.</p>



<p>Another concern is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smartphones-data-collection-security-privacy">privacy and surveillance</a>, given that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/even-bugs-will-be-bugged/501113/">computers can now gather and sort information on their use in a way previously unimaginable</a>. Data on our online behavior can help predict aspects of our private lives, like sexuality. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201801/all-over-your-face">Facial recognition</a> can also follow us around the real world, helping police or authoritarian governments. And the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">emerging field of neurotechnology</a> is already testing ways to connect the brain directly to computers (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 24</em>). Related to privacy is security — hackers can access data that’s locked away, or interfere with pacemakers and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>Computers can also enable deception. AI can generate content that looks real. Language models might be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">fill the internet with fake news</a> and recruiting material for extremist groups (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 22</em>). Generative adversarial networks, a type of deep learning that can generate realistic content, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-program-generates-eerily-realistic-fake-videos">can assist artists or create deepfakes</a>, images or videos showing people doing things they never did (<em>SN: 9/15/18, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>On social media, we also need to worry about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/popularity-twitter-partisanship-pays">polarization in people’s social, political and other views</a>. Generally, recommendation algorithms optimize engagement (and platforms profit through advertising), not civil discourse. <a href="https://neo.life/2021/07/artificial-intelligence-is-learning-to-manipulate-you/">Algorithms can also manipulate us</a> in other ways. Robo-advisers — <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351703682_We_Need_to_Code_for_Ethics">chatbots for dispensing financial advice or providing customer support</a> — might learn to know what we really need, or to push our buttons and upsell us on extraneous products.</p>



<p>Multiple countries are developing autonomous weapons that have the potential to reduce civilian casualties as well as escalate conflict faster than their minders can react. Putting guns or missiles in the hands of robots raises the sci-fi specter of Terminators attempting to eliminate humankind. They might not even be acting with bad intent, falsely reasoning that they are helping humankind by eliminating human cancer (an example of having no common sense). More near-term, automated systems let loose in the real world have already caused flash crashes in the stock market and sudden <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/04/amazon-flies-24-million/">big leaps in book prices on Amazon</a>. If AIs are charged with making life-and-death decisions, they then face the famous trolley problem, deciding whom or what to sacrifice when not everyone can win. Here we’re entering Asimov territory.</p>



<p>That’s a lot to worry about. Russell, of UC Berkeley, suggests where our priorities should lie: “Lethal autonomous weapons are an urgent issue, because people may have already died, and the way things are going, it’s only a matter of time before there’s a mass attack,” he says. “Bias and social media addiction and polarization are both arguably instances of failure of value alignment between algorithms and society, so they are giving us early warnings of how things can easily go wrong.”</p>



<p>There are also social, political and legal questions about how to manage technology in society. Who should be held accountable when an AI system causes harm? (For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/first-pedestrian-death-self-driving-car-fuels-safety-debate">“confused” self-driving cars have killed people</a>.) How can we ensure more equal access to the tools of AI and their benefits, and make sure they don’t discriminate against groups or individuals? How will continuing automation of jobs affect employment? Can we manage the environmental impact of data centers, which use a lot of electricity? Should we preferentially employ explainable algorithms — rather than the black boxes of many neural networks — for greater trust and debuggability, even if it makes the algorithms poorer at prediction?</p>



<h4>What can be done</h4>



<p>Michael Kearns, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and coauthor of the 2019 book <em>The Ethical Algorithm</em>, puts the problems on a spectrum of manageability. At one end is what’s called differential privacy, the ability to add noise to a dataset of, say, medical records so that it can be shared usefully with researchers without revealing much about the individual records. We can now make mathematical guarantees about exactly how private individuals’ data should remain.</p>



<p>Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum is fairness in machine learning. Researchers have developed methods to increase fairness by removing or altering biased training data, or maximize certain types of equality — in loans, for instance — while minimizing reduction in profit. Still, some types of fairness will forever be in mutual conflict, and math can’t tell us which ones we want.</p>



<p>At the far end is explainability. As opposed to fairness, which can be analyzed mathematically in many ways, the quality of an explanation is hard to describe in mathematical terms. “I feel like I haven’t seen a single good definition yet,” Kearns says. “You could say, ‘Here’s an algorithm that will take a trained neural network and try to explain why it rejected you for a loan,’ but [the explanation] doesn’t feel principled.” Ultimately, if the audience doesn’t understand it, it’s not a good explanation, and measuring its success — however you define success — requires user studies.</p>



<p>Something like Asimov’s three laws won’t save us from robots that hurt us while trying to help us. And even if the list were extended to a million laws, the letter of a law is not identical to its spirit. One possible solution is what’s called inverse reinforcement learning, in which computers might learn to decipher what we really value based on our behavior.</p>

<h4>Engineer, heal thyself</h4>



<p>In the 1950 short story “The Evitable Conflict,” Asimov articulated what became a “zeroth law,” a law to supersede all others: “A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.” It should go without saying that the rule should apply with “roboticist” in place of “robot.” For sure, many computer scientists avoid harming humanity, but many also don’t actively engage with the social implications of their work, effectively allowing humanity to come to harm, says Margaret Mitchell, a computer scientist who co-led Google’s Ethical AI team and now consults with organizations on tech ethics. (She’s no relation to computer scientist Melanie Mitchell.)</p>



<p>One hurdle, according to Grosz, of Harvard, is that too many researchers are not properly trained in ethics. But she hopes to change that. Grosz and philosopher Alison Simmons began a program at Harvard called Embedded EthiCS, in which teaching assistants with training in philosophy are embedded in computer science courses and teach lessons on privacy or discrimination or fake news. The program has spread to MIT, Stanford and the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>“We try to get students to think about values and value trade-offs,” Grosz says. Two things have struck her. The first is the difficulty students have with problems that lack right answers and require arguing for particular choices. The second is, despite their frustration, “how much students care about this set of issues,” Grosz says.</p>



<p>Another way to educate technologists about their influence is to widen collaborations. According to Mitchell, “computer science needs to move from holding math up as the be-all and end-all, to holding up both math and social science, and psychology as well.” Researchers should bring in experts in these topics, she says.</p>



<p>Going the other way, Kearns says, they should also share their own technical expertise with regulators, lawyers and policy makers. Otherwise, policies will be so vague as to be useless. Without specific definitions of privacy or fairness written into law, companies can choose whatever’s most convenient or profitable.</p>



<p>When evaluating how a tool will affect a community, the best experts are often community members themselves. Grosz advocates consulting with diverse populations. Diversity helps in both user studies and technology teams. “If you don’t have people in the room who think differently from you,” Grosz says, “the differences are just not in front of you. If somebody says not every patient has a smartphone, boom, you start thinking differently about what you’re designing.”</p>



<p>According to Margaret Mitchell, “the most pressing problem is the diversity and inclusion of who’s at the table from the start. All the other issues fall out from there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-oldest-human-dna-mating-long-distance-stone-age">Africa’s oldest human DNA helps unveil an ancient population shift</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Africans in search of mates traded long-distance travels for regional connections starting about 20,000 years ago, an analysis of ancient and modern DNA suggests.</p>



<p>That shift occurred after treks across much of Africa to find breeding partners had been the norm starting at least 50,000 years ago, the same analysis shows. These new findings — helped by several examples of the oldest human DNA from Africa isolated to date — offer the first genetic support for a previously suspected change in mating patterns around that time.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04430-9">newly identified, long-distance movements of ancient human groups</a> help explain archaeological discoveries of common types of stone and bone toolmaking and other cultural behaviors that increasingly appeared across much of Africa beginning about 50,000 years ago, evolutionary geneticist Mark Lipson of Harvard Medical School and colleagues report February 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Starting around that time, inherited sets of gene variants became increasingly similar in ancient individuals found in central, eastern and southern regions of sub-Saharan Africa, the researchers report. This suggests that this area was a genetic melting pot, in which hunter-gatherers migrated between the three regions, mating with each other along the way.</p>



<p>Comparisons of ancient human DNA to that of present-day hunter-gatherers and herders in the same three parts of Africa indicate that people generally stopped traveling outside their home regions to find mating partners about 20,000 years ago, the team says. People may have stayed closer to home at least partly because the last ice age peaked around that time, reducing the number of areas harboring enough edible plants, animals and other resources needed to survive, says Yale University bioarchaeologist and study coauthor Jessica Thompson.</p>



<p>“As the African tropics came out of the last ice age, the landscape became full of many small groups of people with diverse local cultural traditions,” Thompson says. Culturally distinct groups tended to seek mates from neighboring groups with whom they had more in common than migrants from distant regions, she suspects.</p>



<p>African hunter-gatherers today still follow local cultural practices, speak in regionally distinct tongues and draw mates from nearby groups. Migrations of West African farmers to eastern and southern Africa starting about 2,000 years ago have largely erased ancient ancestry patterns in the DNA of present-day Africans. That makes ancient DNA crucial for unveiling those lost patterns.</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists extracted ancient DNA from the bones of six individuals previously excavated in eastern and south-central Africa. Estimates of when these people lived range from about 18,000 to 5,000 years ago. These new genetic data were studied along with already published DNA evidence for 28 African hunter-gatherers dating to as early as about 8,000 years ago. The researchers were able to retrieve additional DNA for 15 of those individuals.</p>



<p>A big boost to the new investigation came from the inclusion of several examples of the oldest known human DNA from Africa. Even older examples of DNA from <em>Homo sapiens</em> and closely related populations, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-reveals-who-spains-pit-bones-cave">Neandertals from around 430,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/14/16</em>), have been found in Europe and Asia where cold conditions preserve genetic material better than the African tropics do. Only <em>H. sapiens</em> is known to have inhabited Africa during the Stone Age stretch covered in the new study.</p>



<p>Calculations of the genetic variation in three present-day African groups — San hunter-gatherers from southern Africa, Mbuti hunter-gatherers from central Africa and Dinka herders and farmers from northeastern Africa — were used to estimate ancestry patterns reflected in each sample of ancient DNA.</p>



<p>Lipson and colleagues’ findings fit with previous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-kids-dna-reveals-new-insights-how-africa-was-populated">ancient and modern African DNA studies suggesting that mating among widespread human groups began 200,000 years ago or more</a> (<em>SN: 1/22/20</em>), says evolutionary geneticist Carina Schlebusch of the University of Uppsala in Sweden, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Hints of a “ghost” human population unknown from any fossils, but which contributed to the ancestry of ancient eastern Africans, also emerged in the new study, Thompson says. Many more ancient <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-west-africans-may-have-dna-genes-ancient-ghost-hominid">ghost groups once existed in different parts of Africa</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>), she suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killer-asteroid-chicxulub-spring-impact-fossils-fish">The Age of Dinosaurs may have ended in springtime</a></h4>

              
                <p>About 66 million years ago, a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into Earth and not long afterward, all nonbird dinosaurs, as well as many other species on land and in the sea, perished. Scientists don’t know the exact year of the strike, but researchers now say they have determined the impact’s season — springtime in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>The finding comes from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04446-1">a new analysis of the bones of ancient fish</a> entombed at an extraordinary site dubbed Tanis in southwestern North Dakota, the researchers report February 23 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Pinning down the season of the impact may help researchers explain the global pattern of survival of birds, small mammals and other creatures following the strike. For example, creatures that spend the winters in burrows underground would have emerged and been active during a Northern Hemisphere spring, rendering them especially vulnerable. By contrast, in a Southern Hemisphere autumn, these creatures probably would have been settling in for a season-long nap and perhaps were more protected.</p>





<p>Discovered in 2008, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-north-dakota-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact">sediments at Tanis</a> purportedly capture the flooding of a riverbed and other destruction that happened there in the immediate aftermath of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">the Chicxulub impact</a>, which took place 3,000 kilometers away off the coast of what’s now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula (<em>SN: 4/2/19; SN: 1/25/17</em>). Previous work has also suggested that some of the fossilized Tanis fish have tiny spherules — solidified globs of molten and vaporized rock that had been flung skyward from the asteroid impact — stuck in their gills, a strong sign that the fish were still living and breathing as hell rained down on them.</p>



<p>“These creatures died incredibly close to the moment that debris was coming down,” says Thomas Holtz Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Some fish bones have features that can record seasonal and annual cycles of growth — akin to the growth rings in trees. These features typically include a thick band signifying vigorous bone growth, a thinner band that characterizes slow growth and a feature called a line of arrested growth that can denote wintertime or, sometimes, periods of famine or drought.</p>



<p>To figure out the season of the asteroid strike, Melanie During, a vertebrate paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, and colleagues examined the jawbones of three paddlefish and bony spines from the pectoral fins of three sturgeons. The outermost layers of all six analyzed bones indicate rapid growth that hadn’t yet reached peak growth rates seen during previous years’ growth cycles, During says. That means that the last growth season recorded in the bones hadn’t yet reached its summertime peak at the time these fish died.</p>

<p>The regularity of the lines of arrested growth chronicled in the fish bones strongly suggest that the fish weren’t suffering from drought or famine when they died, During says. “By all indications, these fish were doing fine.” Taking the results together, the team pinpoints spring as the season of the dinosaurs’ demise, as least for Northern Hemisphere dinos.</p>



<p>“I really do think this is a solid story backed by strong evidence,” says Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. The asteroid impact “would have turned a season that is normally about growth and flowering and rebirth into a time of unbelievable fire and fury,” he notes.</p>



<p>Despite the passage of more than 66 million years, Holtz says, “it’s pretty amazing that we can look at Earth’s worst day and figure out the time of year it was.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">A fast radio burst’s unlikely source may be a cluster of old stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a galaxy not so far away, astronomers have located a surprising source of a mysterious, rapid radio signal.</p>



<p>The signal, a repeating fast radio burst, or FRB, was observed over several months in 2021, allowing astronomers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04354-w">to pinpoint its location to a globular cluster</a> — a tight, spherical cluster of stars — in M81, a massive spiral galaxy 12 million light-years away. The findings, published February 23 in <em>Nature</em>, are challenging astronomers’ assumptions of what objects create FRBs.</p>



<p>“This is a very revolutionary discovery,” says Bing Zhang, an astronomer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who was not involved in the study. “It is exciting to see an FRB from a globular cluster. That is not the favorited place people imagined.”</p>





<p>Astronomers have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">puzzling over these mysterious cosmic radio signals</a>, which typically last less than a millisecond, since their discovery in 2007 (<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>). But in 2020, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">an FRB was seen in our own galaxy</a>, helping scientists determine one source must be magnetars — young, highly magnetized neutron stars with magnetic fields a trillion times as strong as Earth’s <em>(SN: 6/4/20).</em></p>



<p>The new findings come as a surprise because globular clusters harbor only old stars — some of the oldest in the universe. Magnetars, on the other hand, are young leftover dense cores typically created from the death of short-lived massive stars. The magnetized cores are thought to lose the energy needed to produce FRBs after about 10,000 years. Globular clusters, whose stars average many billions of years old, are much too elderly to have had a sufficiently recent young stellar death to create this type of magnetar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To pinpoint the FRB, astronomer Franz Kirsten and colleagues used a web of 11 radio telescopes spread across Europe and Asia to catch five bursts from the same source. Combining the radio observations, the astronomers were able to zero in on the signal’s origins, finding it was almost certainly from within a globular cluster.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting discovery because it was completely unexpected,” says Kirsten, of ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, who is based at the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden.</p>



<p>The new FRB might still be caused by a magnetar, the team proposes, but one that formed in a different way, such as from old stars common in globular clusters. For example, this magnetar could have been created from a remnant stellar core known as a white dwarf that had gathered too much material from a companion star, causing it to collapse.</p>



<p>“This is a [magnetar] formation channel that has been predicted, but it’s hard to see,” Kirsten says. “Nobody has actually seen such an event.”</p>



<p>Alternatively, the magnetar could have been formed from the merger of two stars — such as a pair of white dwarfs, a pair of neutron stars or one of each — in close orbit around one another, but this scenario is less likely, Kirsten says. It’s also possible the FRB source isn’t a magnetar at all but a very energetic millisecond&nbsp;pulsar, which is also a type of neutron star that could be found in a globular cluster, but one that has a weaker magnetic field.</p>



<p>To date, only a few FRB sources have been precisely pinpointed, and their locations are all in or close to star-forming regions in galaxies. Besides adding a new source for FRBs, the findings suggest that magnetars created from something other than the death of young stars might be more common than expected.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on February 23, 2022</p>



<p><strong>(San Francisco) &ndash; </strong>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries (CSAL) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS&rsquo; suite of journals<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited about our first deal of this kind with a gold OA publisher which allows the participating institutions to contain their costs without limiting the publishing opportunities for their researchers,&rdquo; said Susanne Aerni, Head Consortial Services, Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The University of Lausanne is delighted to partner with PLOS and participate in these innovative initiatives to advance Open Access in a fair, transparent and affordable way!&rdquo;&nbsp;said Micaela Crespo, Head of Open Access, University of Lausanne.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Participating institutions include, &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Universita della Svizzera italiana, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne with Haute &Eacute;cole P&eacute;dagogique du Canton de Vaud, University of Lucerne with University of Teacher Education Lucerne, Schwyz University of Teacher Education and University of Teacher Education Zug, University of Neuch&acirc;tel and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.</p>



<p>Under the agreement, which began earlier this year, the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years&rsquo; publication levels. Consortium institutions will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS&rsquo; mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The agreement with the <a>Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries </a>is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreements with consortia in the United States,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;CSAL share our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>
