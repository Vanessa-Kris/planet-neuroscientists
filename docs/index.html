              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-paws-traction-snow-microstructures-friction">Here’s how polar bears might get traction on snow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny “fingers” can help polar bears get a grip.</p>



<p>Like the rubbery nubs on the bottom of baby socks, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microstructures on the bears’ paw pads</a> offer some extra friction, scientists report November 1 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. The pad protrusions may keep polar bears from slipping on snow, says Ali Dhinojwala, a polymer scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio who has also studied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nanotube-carpet-mimics-gecko-feet">the sticking power of gecko feet</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/05</em>).</p>





<p>Nathaniel Orndorf, a materials scientist at Akron who focuses on ice, adhesion and friction, was interested in the work Dhinojwala’s lab did on geckos, but “we can’t really put geckos on the ice,” he says. So he turned to polar bears.</p>



<p>Orndorf teamed up with Dhinojwala and Austin Garner, an animal biologist now at Syracuse University in New York, and compared the paws of polar bears, brown bears, American black bears and a sun bear. All but the sun bear had paw pad bumps. But the polar bears’ bumps looked a little different. For a given diameter, their bumps tend to be taller, the team found. That extra height translates to more traction on lab-made snow, experiments with 3-D printed models of the bumps suggest.</p>



<p>Until now, scientists didn’t know that bump shape could make the difference between gripping and slipping, Dhinojwala says.</p>

<p>Polar bear paw pads are also ringed with fur and are smaller than those of other bears, the team reports, adaptations that might let the Arctic animals conserve body heat as they trod upon ice. Smaller pads generally mean less real estate for grabbing the ground. So extra-grippy pads could help polar bears make the most of what they’ve got, Orndorf says.</p>



<p>Along with bumpy pads, the team hopes to study polar bears’ fuzzy paws and short claws, which might also give the animals a nonslip grip.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aye-aye-primates-nose-picking-fingers">Bizarre aye-aye primates take nose picking to the extreme</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aye-ayes are true champions of nose picking.</p>



<p>A new video offers the first evidence that these nocturnal lemurs of Madagascar stick their fingers up their noses and lick off the mucus. They don’t use just any finger for the job, either. The primates go spelunking for snot with the ultralong, witchy middle finger they typically use to find and fish grubs out of tree bark.</p>



<p>A reconstruction of the inside of an aye-aye’s head based on CT scans shows that this spindly digit probably <a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jzo.13034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pokes all the way through the animal’s nasal passages</a> to reach its throat, researchers report online October 26 in the <em>Journal of Zoology</em>. &nbsp;</p>





<p>“This is a brilliant example of how science can serve human curiosity,” says Michael Haslam, a primate archaeologist based in London who was not involved in the new work. “My first take was that it’s a cool — and a bit creepy — video, but [the researchers] have gone beyond that initial reaction of ‘What on Earth?’ to actually explore what’s happening inside the animal.”</p>



<p>The new footage stars Kali, a female aye-aye (<em>Daubentonia madagascariensis</em>) at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, N.C. “The aye-aye stopped eating and started to pick its nose, and I was really surprised,” says evolutionary biologist Anne-Claire Fabre, who filmed the video. “I was wondering where the finger was going.” An aye-aye is about as big as a house cat, but its clawed middle finger is some 8 centimeters long. And Kali was plunging almost the entire digit up her snout to sample her own snot with dainty licks.</p>



<p>“There is one moment where the camera is [shaking], and I was giggling,” says Fabre, of the Natural History Museum of Bern in Switzerland. Afterward, she asked her colleagues if they had ever seen an aye-aye picking its nose. “The ones that were working a lot with aye-ayes would tell me, ‘Oh, yeah, it’s happening really often,’” says Fabre, who later witnessed the behavior in several other aye-ayes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="321" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev.jpg" alt="An illustration of the internal structure of an aye-aye's head to see the inner working and a photo of an aye-aye reaching for the camera" class="wp-image-3118724" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/103122_mt_aye-aye-nose-pickers_inline_rev-330x156.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118724">A reconstruction of the internal structure of an aye-aye’s head, based on CT scans, reveals that when the primate picks its nose, the tip of the long middle digit probably reaches the back of the throat.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118724">From left: © Renaud Boistel; © David Haring/Duke Lemur Center</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This got Fabre and her colleagues curious about how many other primate species have been caught with their fingers in their nostrils. The researchers scoured the literature for past studies and the internet for other videos documenting the behavior.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, “most of the literature that we were finding were jokes,” Fabre says. “I was really surprised, because there is a lot of literature on other types of pretty gross behaviors, such as coprophagy,” or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pika-yak-poop-winter-slow-metabolism-yak-biology">poo eating</a>, among animals (<em>SN: 7/19/21</em>). But between all the bogus articles, the team did find some real reports of primate nose picking, including research done by Jane Goodall in the 1970s.</p>



<p>Aye-ayes are now the 12th known species of primate, including humans, to pick their noses and snack on the snot, the researchers found. Others include gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and macaques. Nose pickers tend to be primates that have especially good dexterity and use tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The team [has] given us the first map of nose picking across our primate family tree, which immediately raises questions about just how much of this behavior is happening out there, unseen or unreported,” Haslam says. He remembers once seeing a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkey-uses-stick-pick-its-teeth-and-nose">capuchin monkey using a twig or stem to pick its nose</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>“I’m surprised that there aren’t more reports on nose picking, especially from zoos where animals are watched every day,” Haslam adds. “Perhaps our own social stigma around it means that scientists are less likely to want to report nose-picking animals, or it may even be seen as too common to be interesting.”</p>

</div><figcaption>This aye-aye, named Kali, was caught on camera sticking her extra-long, skinny middle finger up her nose and then licking off the snot — making her kind the 12th known species of primate to eat their own boogers.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fact that so many primate species have been spotted picking their noses and eating the boogers makes Fabre’s team and Haslam wonder whether this seemingly nasty habit has some unknown advantage. Perhaps eating germ-laden boogers boosts the immune system.</p>



<p>For now, untangling the evolutionary origins and potential perks of nose picking will require a more complete census of what species — primate or otherwise — mine and munch on their own mucus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-swarms-electric-charge-static-electricity-storm-clouds-honeybees">Insect swarms might generate as much electric charge as storm clouds</a></h4>

              
                <p>You might feel a spark when you talk to your crush, but living things don’t require romance to make electricity. A study published October 24 in <em>iScience</em> suggests that <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01513-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the electricity naturally produced by swarming insects like honeybees and locusts</a> is an unappreciated contributor to the overall electric charge of the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“Particles in the atmosphere easily charge up,” says Joseph Dwyer, a physicist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham who was not involved with the study. “Insects are little particles moving around the atmosphere.” Despite this, the potential that insect-induced static electricity plays a role in the atmosphere’s electric field, which influences how water droplets form, dust particles move and lightning strikes brew, hasn’t been considered before, he says.</p>





<p>Scientists have known about the minuscule electric charge carried by living things, such as insects, for a long time. However, the idea that an electric bug-aloo could alter the charge in the air on a large scale came to researchers through sheer chance.</p>



<p>“We were actually interested in understanding how atmospheric electricity influences biology,” says Ellard Hunting, a biologist at the University of Bristol in England. But when a swarm of honeybees passed over a sensor meant to pick up background atmospheric electricity at the team’s field station, the scientists began to suspect that the influence could flow the other way too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunting and colleagues, including biologists and physicists, measured the change in the strength of electric charge when other honeybee swarms passed over the sensor, revealing an average voltage increase of 100 volts per meter. The denser the insect swarm, the greater the charge produced.</p>



<p>This inspired the team to think about even larger insect swarms, like the biblical hordes of locusts that plagued Egypt in antiquity (and, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weather-radar-grasshopper-swarm-las-vegas-night-artificial-light">in 2021, Las Vegas</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/21</em>)). Flying objects, from animals to airplanes, build up static electricity as they move through the air. The team measured the charges of individual desert locusts (<em>Schistocerca gregaria</em>) as they flew in a wind tunnel powered by a computer fan. Taking data on locust density from other studies, the team then used a computer simulation based on the honeybee swarm data to scale up these single locust measurements into electric charge estimates for an entire locust swarm. Clouds of locusts could produce electricity on a per-meter basis on par with that in storm clouds, the scientists report.</p>



<p>Hunting says the results highlight the need to explore the unknown lives of airborne animals, which can sometimes reach much greater heights than honeybees or locusts. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soaring-spiders-may-get-cues-electric-charges-air">Spiders, for example, can soar kilometers above Earth when “ballooning”</a> on silk threads to reach new habitats (<em>SN: 7/5/18</em>). “There’s a lot of biology in the sky,” he says, from insects and birds to microorganisms. “Everything adds up.”</p>



<p>Though some insect swarms can be immense, Dwyer says that electrically charged flying animals are unlikely to ever reach the density required to produce lightning like storm clouds do. But their presence could interfere with our efforts to watch for looming strikes that could hurt people or damage property.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“If you have something messing up our electric field measurements, that could cause a false alarm,” he says, “or it could make you miss something that’s actually important.” While the full effect that insects and other animals have on atmospheric electricity remains to be deduced, Dwyer says these results are “an interesting first look” into the phenomenon.</p>



<p>Hunting says this initial step into an exciting new area of research shows that working with scientists from different fields can spark shocking findings. “Being really interdisciplinary,” he says, “allows for these kinds of serendipitous moments.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-turbines-capture-carbon-dioxide-power">Wind turbines could help capture carbon dioxide while providing power</a></h4>

              
                <p>Wind turbines could offer a double whammy in the fight against climate change.</p>



<p>Besides harnessing wind to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-farm-windbreak-turbine-speed-power-output">generate clean energy</a>, turbines may help to funnel carbon dioxide to systems that pull the greenhouse gas out of the air (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>). Researchers say their simulations show that wind turbines can drag dirty air from above a city or a smokestack into the turbines’ wakes. That boosts the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that makes it to machines that can remove it from the atmosphere. The researchers plan to describe <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/L14.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their simulations</a> and <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/L14.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wind tunnel test</a> of a scaled-down system at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis on November 21.</p>





<p>Addressing climate change will require dramatic reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide that humans put into the air — but that alone <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">won’t be enough</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). One part of the solution could be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-carbon-dioxide-capture-recycling-climate-change">direct air capture</a> systems that remove some CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (<em>SN: 9/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>But the large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by factories, power plants and cities are often concentrated at heights that put it out of reach of machinery on the ground that can remove it. “We’re looking into the fluid dynamics benefits of utilizing the wake of the wind turbine to redirect higher concentrations” down to carbon capture systems, says mechanical engineer Clarice Nelson of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>As large, power-generating wind turbines rotate, they cause turbulence that pulls air down into the wakes behind them, says mechanical engineer Luciano Castillo, also of Purdue. It’s an effect that can concentrate carbon dioxide enough to make capture feasible, particularly near large cities like Chicago.</p>



<p>“The beauty is that [around Chicago], you have one of the best wind resources in the region, so you can use the wind turbine to take some of the dirty air in the city and capture it,” Castillo says. Wind turbines don’t require the cooling that nuclear and fossil fuel plants need. “So not only are you producing clean energy,” he says, “you are not using water.”</p>



<p>Running the capture systems from energy produced by the wind turbines can also address the financial burden that often goes along with removing CO<sub>2 </sub>from the air. “Even with tax credits and potentially selling the CO<sub>2</sub>, there’s a huge gap between the value that you can get from capturing it and the actual cost” that comes with powering capture with energy that comes from other sources, Nelson says. “Our method would be a no-cost added benefit” to wind turbine farms.</p>



<p>There are probably lots of factors that will impact CO<sub>2 </sub>transport by real-world turbines, including the interactions the turbine wakes have with water, plants and the ground, says Nicholas Hamilton, a mechanical engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., who was not involved with the new studies. “I’m interested to see how this group scaled their experiment for wind tunnel investigation.”</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m glad to share that I am going to start my own junior research group at the University of Zurich in March 2023!</p>



<p>As an <a href="https://www.snf.ch/en/N18L3oGWomTSSGkF/funding/careers/ambizione">Ambizione</a> fellow, I will receive funding for my own salary, some equipment, consumables and a PhD student (total of ca. 900k CHF). There will be possibilities to recruit more students, but I will try to start small, so that I can spend my time with my students, experiments and data analysis and less so with buraucratic obligations that come with other positions. The general research direction of my group is already reflected by some write-ups of previous years (<em><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain/">2018</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">2019</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/12/31/annual-report-2021/">2021</a></em>). There will be a focus on single neurons, plasticity, possibly also dendrites, and closed-loop paradigms.</p>



<p>My group will benefit from being part of the <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">lab of Fritjof Helmchen</a>. Working with all the resources and experts available in the Helmchen Lab, and at the same time being supervised by myself is probably not bad combination!</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re finishing your Master&#8217;s right now and are looking for a PhD position, or if you have a talented Master&#8217;s student who would be a good fit for my group, get in touch with me. Here&#8217;s the official position opening:</p>



<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>



<p>The SNSF AMBIZIONE junior group of <strong><em>Dr. Peter Rupprecht</em></strong> at the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Switzerland (starting 1.3.2023), is offering a PhD position to study neuronal circuits in the living mouse brain. The goal of the project is to understand how a single neuron learns about the effect of its action potentials. The project therefore addresses the problem of “credit assignment” in the brain experimentally.</p>



<p>The project will be conducted in the lab of and officially supervised by <strong><em>Prof. Fritjof Helmchen</em></strong>. Working on this project will therefore provide ample opportunity to collaborate with and learn from some of the best neuroscientists.</p>



<p>The methods to drive this project will be, among others, <em>in vivo</em> calcium imaging of neuronal activity, <em>in vivo</em> cell-attached recordings, closed-loop virtual realities, and advanced data analysis methods. You will be able to select your favorite sub-projects and techniques from this spectrum, and you will receive direct guidance from Peter Rupprecht to learn anything that is required.</p>



<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>



<p>You have studied neuroscience, physics, biology, informatics or a related field. You are familiar with or eager to learn the techniques required for this project, including elements of microscopy, mouse handling, electrophysiology, programming and data analysis in Python and/or Matlab. Ideally, you enjoy solving problems, even if it takes long and the problems are difficult. Some programming skills or the strong desire to acquire such are important for any kind of project in this lab.</p>



<p><strong>Application guideline</strong></p>



<p>Please send your application including a CV and your transcript of records to Peter Rupprecht (<a href="mailto:rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch">rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch</a>). Please include a letter of motivation that covers the following aspects: What talents or previous experience of yours are possibly relevant to this project? What would you like to learn and achieve during your PhD? Do you enjoy writing in English? If you have coding or experimental experience, describe your most challenging previous program or project.</p>



<p><strong>Starting date</strong></p>



<p>The PhD position is available starting March 2023.</p>

As we reported a month ago, “data thug” James Heathers “found at least 1,500 off-topic papers, many with abstracts containing ‘tortured phrases’ that may have been &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/28/exclusive-elsevier-retracting-500-papers-for-shoddy-peer-review/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Exclusive: Elsevier retracting 500 papers for shoddy peer review</span></a>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-lions-wildfires-risks-road-crossing">Mountain lions pushed out by wildfires take more risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mountain lions have no interest in people, or the built-up areas we enjoy. But after a 2018 wildfire in California, local lions took more risks, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222014762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing roads more often and moving around more in the daytime</a>, scientists report October 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>. It’s another way the effects of human development could be putting pressure on vulnerable wildlife — in this case, potentially pushing them toward our bumpers.</p>



<p>The Woolsey Fire began near Los Angeles on November 8, 2018, and burned more than 36,000 hectares in the Santa Monica Mountains. Nearly 300,000 people evacuated, and three people died. Animals fled the fire too, including the local mountain lions (<em>Puma concolor</em>). The fire was a tragedy, but also a scientific opportunity, says Rachel Blakey, a global change biologist at UCLA. Many of the lions wore tracking collars, allowing scientists to study how the fire changed their behavior.</p>





<p>Of the 11 collared cougars in the area at the time, nine made it to safety during the fire itself. “They have really large home ranges, so it&#8217;s nothing to them to be able to cover many kilometers in a day,” Blakey says.</p>



<p>No matter how much they moved, the mountain lions avoided people. One collared cat, P-64, initially fled the fire — until he got close to a developed area. Given the choice between fire and people, the lion retreated back into the burning area. “That’s where his movements stopped,” Blakey says. The park service later found P-64’s remains. He&#8217;d burned his paws, and it’s possible that he was unable to hunt and starved to death.</p>



<p>Using data from the nine lions that survived the fire and others collared after, the scientists showed that the cats generally avoided the severely burned areas of their territories. With vegetation gone, the cats had little cover for stalking and ambushing prey.</p>



<p>Instead, the cougars stuck to unburned areas, and continued to avoid people. But they took more risks around human infrastructure, increasing their road crossings from an average of about three times per month to five. </p>

<p>These weren’t all two-lane country highways. The first collared lion to successfully cross Interstate 405, which has 10 lanes in places, did it after the Woolsey Fire. And the big cats crossed U.S. Route 101 once every four months, whereas before the fire, they’d crossed only once every two years. Their territories also overlapped more often, increasing the potential for deadly encounters between the solitary cats. And the generally nocturnal animals increased activity during daytime hours from 10 percent to 16 percent of their active time — boosting a lion’s chances of potentially bump into a human.</p>



<p>Road crossing is what Blakey calls a “risk mismatch.” Lions in areas with lots of people appear to weigh the risk of encountering humans as more dangerous. But “running across a freeway is a lot more likely to be fatal,” she says. That risk, combined with the risk of running into other cats, can be deadly. One young, collared male ended up dead on a freeway in the months after the fire. He was fleeing a fight with an older, uncollared male. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intense burns like the Woolsey Fire highlight the resilience of mountain lions, says Winston Vickers, a wildlife research veterinarian at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study. “They have amazing mobility, they mostly can get away from the immediate fire, they mostly survive,” he notes. The changes in risk-taking, he says, could reflect how confined the population is, hemmed into the mountains by human development.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animals-get-safe-spots-cross-road-and-car-collisions-drop">Wildlife crossings</a>, such as the new Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing over the 101, will hopefully give the mountain lions a safer option for roaming, though the main goal is to promote gene flow between lion populations, Blakey says (<em>SN: 5/31/16</em>). In a landscape where fire, humans and highways combine, it’s good to have somewhere to run. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">Meet the BOAT, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brightest gamma-ray burst ever recorded recently lit up a distant galaxy — and astronomers have nicknamed it the BOAT, for Brightest of All Time.</p>



<p>“We use the boat emoji a lot when we’re talking about it” on the messaging app Slack, says astronomer Jillian Rastinejad of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>Gamma-ray bursts are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-two-gamma-ray-bursts-created-record-breaking-high-energy-photons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energetic explosions</a> that go off when a massive star dies and leaves behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black hole</a> or neutron star (<em>SN: 11/20/19; SN: 8/2/21</em>). The collapse sets off jets of gamma rays zipping away from the poles of the former star. If those jets happen to be pointed right at Earth, astronomers can see them as a gamma-ray burst.</p>





<p>This <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new burst</a>, officially named GRB 221009A, was probably triggered by a supernova giving birth to a black hole in a galaxy about 2 billion light-years from Earth, researchers announced October 13. Astronomers think it released as much energy as roughly three suns converting all of their mass to pure energy.</p>



<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, a gamma-ray telescope in space, automatically detected the blast October 9 around 10:15 a.m. EDT, and promptly alerted astronomers <a href="https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that something strange was happening</a>.</p>



<p>“At the time, when it went off, it looked kind of weird to us,” says Penn State astrophysicist Jamie Kennea, who is the head of science operations for Swift. The blast’s position in the sky seemed to line up with the plane of the Milky Way. So at first Kennea and colleagues thought it was within our own galaxy, and so unlikely to be something as dramatically energetic as a gamma-ray burst. If a burst like this went off inside the Milky Way, it would be visible to the naked eye, which wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>But soon Kennea learned that NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope had also seen the flash — and it was one of the brightest things the telescope had ever seen. A fresh look at the Swift data convinced Kennea and colleagues that the flash was the brightest gamma-ray burst seen in the 50 years of observing these rare explosions.</p>



<p>“It’s quite exceptional,” Kennea says. “It stands head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>

Cenko</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After confirmation of the burst’s BOAT bonafides — a term coined by Rastinejad’s adviser, Northwestern astronomer Wen-fai Fong — other astronomers rushed to get a look. Within days, scientists around the world got a glimpse of the blast with telescopes in space and on the ground, in nearly every type of light. Even some radio telescopes typically used as lightning detectors saw a <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/32745.gcn3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden disturbance associated with GRB 221009A</a>, suggesting that the burst stripped electrons from atoms in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the hours and days after the initial explosion, the burst subsided and gave way to a still relatively bright afterglow. Eventually, astronomers expect to see it fade&nbsp;even more, replaced by glowing ripples of material in the supernova remnant.</p>



<p>The extreme brightness was probably at least partially due to GRB 221009A’s relative proximity, Kennea says. A couple billion light-years might seem far, but the average gamma-ray burst is more like 10 billion light-years away. It probably was also just intrinsically bright, though there hasn’t been time to figure out why.</p>



<p>Studying the blast as it changes is “probably going to challenge some of our assumptions of how gamma-ray bursts work,” Kennea says. “I think people who are gamma-ray burst theorists are going to be inundated with so much data that this is going to change theories that they thought were pretty solid.”</p>



<p>GRB 221009A will move behind the sun from Earth’s perspective starting in late November, shielding it temporarily from view. But because its glow is still so bright now, astronomers are hopeful that they’ll still be able to see it when it becomes visible again in February.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited for a few months from now when we have all the beautiful data,” Rastinejad says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/treatment-nightmares-sleep">A new treatment for debilitating nightmares offers sweeter dreams</a></h4>

              
                <p>For people haunted by recurring nightmares, untroubled sleep would be a dream come true. Now in a small experiment, neuroscientists have demonstrated a technique that, for some, may chase the bad dreams away.</p>



<p><a></a>Enhancing the standard treatment for nightmare disorder with a memory-boosting technique cut down average weekly nightmares among a few dozen people <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01477-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from three to near zero</a>, researchers report online October 27 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“The fact that they could actually make a big difference in the frequency of those nightmares is huge,” says Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at UCLA who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>





<p><a></a>People with nightmare disorder fear the night not for the monsters under the bed, but the monsters in their dreams. Frequent, terrifying dreams disturb sleep and even affect well-being in waking life. The go-to nightmare disorder treatment is imagery rehearsal therapy, or IRT. In this treatment, patients reimagine nightmares with a positive spin, mentally rehearsing the new story line while awake. It reduces nightmares for most but fails for nearly a third of people.</p>



<p><a></a>To boost IRT’s power, neuroscientist Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva and her colleagues leveraged a learning technique called targeted memory reactivation, or TMR. In this technique, a person focuses on learning something while a sound plays, and that same cue plays again during sleep. Experiencing the cue during sleep, which is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-sleep-learning-memory-remember-forget">important for memory storage</a>, may reactivate and strengthen the associated memory (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>).</p>



<p><a></a>In the new study, the researchers gave 36 people with nightmare disorder training in IRT, randomly assigning half of them to rehearse their revised nightmares in silence. The other half rehearsed while a short piano chord, the TMR cue, played every 10 seconds for five minutes.</p>



<p><a></a>For two weeks, participants practiced IRT daily and kept a dream diary. While they slept, a headband outfitted with sensors recorded their brains’ electrical activity and tracked their sleep stages. The piano chord served as a dream soundtrack, with the headband sounding off every 10 seconds during rapid eye movement, the sleep stage associated with dreaming. The headband played the sound for all participants, but only half had come to associate the sound with their new scenario during the IRT training.</p>



<p><a></a>For those trained on the chord, TMR nearly vanquished the nightmares, bringing the weekly average down from three to 0.2, and even encouraged happier dreams. The group that received only IRT improved too, but still averaged one weekly nightmare.</p>



<p><a></a>The TMR-IRT combination also had more staying power after three months, with that group’s average rising only slightly from about 0.2 to 0.3 nightmares a week, while the IRT-only group’s jumped to 1.5.</p>



<p><a></a>Larger studies will need to test how generalizable this treatment combination is. This study featured a small number of people, all young adults ages 20 to 35 who had nightmare disorder and no other psychiatric conditions. The study also didn’t compare IRT and TMR to no treatment, although the researchers write that previous studies have already shown how effective IRT can be.</p>



<p><a></a>If a TMR-IRT combo proves as strong in future research, it still has a way to go before it’s widely accessible. Commercially available sleep trackers in watches and rings have yet to distinguish between sleep stages as accurately as brain-monitoring tools.</p>



<p><a></a>Even with these caveats, the results are encouraging, Poe says. She suggests that future studies could test whether the TMR-IRT combination can help people with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/ptsd-good-nights-sleep-means-feeling-safe">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, or PTSD, where nightmares rehash traumatic events (<em>SN 9/12/14)</em>.</p>



<p>That’s something Schwartz wants to try. “I’m not sure we’ll succeed with these particular patients,” she says. “But if we do, this would be a really important addition to the methods we have for treating PTSD.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whiskey-flavor-gold-ions-chemistry">Mixing gold ions into whiskey can reveal its flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new kind of “gold standard” could soon permeate the whiskey industry.</p>



<p>Whiskey distillers typically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/american-whiskeys-leave-unique-webs-when-evaporated">age spirits in charred, wooden casks</a> for years, allowing the liquor to gradually absorb flavorful chemicals released from the wood (<em>SN: 10/31/19</em>). Now, researchers have demonstrated that swirling gold ions into a whiskey can reveal how much flavor the liquor has taken in — a quality called agedness. The method could provide master blenders with a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsanm.2c03406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick and inexpensive test for whiskey agedness</a>, researchers report October 6 in <em>ACS Applied Nano Materials</em>.</p>





<p>“A tiny amount of gold gives you this really bright, strong, red or blue or purple color,” says William Peveler, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The stronger the color, and the quicker that color arises, the more aged the whiskey, he says.</p>



<p>Master blenders sometimes conduct tasting sessions to gauge agedness, but this process can be labor intensive. Alternatively, laboratory assays can measure agedness by checking whiskeys for flavorful chemicals called congeners, absorbed from wood casks, but such analyses can be expensive.</p>



<p>Past research has shown that various chemicals, from <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac048691v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurotransmitters</a> to <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ay/c9ay01942a/unauth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor-tasting compounds in maple syrup</a>, could trigger gold ions in a solution to coalesce into ultra-tiny gold nuggets, or nanoparticles. So Peveler and colleagues mixed solutions containing less than a penny’s worth of gold ions into different whiskey blends and a vodka. While no nanoparticles formed in the vodka, the ions reacted with whiskey congeners to form nanoparticles in minutes. The size and shape of the nanoparticles varied between whiskeys, causing the spirits to flourish with different colors.</p>



<p><a></a>The researchers plan to further investigate how gold nanoparticles grow alongside alcohols and sugars in whiskeys to develop an even more comprehensive test for agedness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-particles-cosmic-rays-inside-cyclones-weather">Particles from space provide a new look inside cyclones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Particles raining down from space offer 3-D views inside swirling tropical storms.</p>



<p>Muons created from cosmic rays that smash into Earth’s upper atmosphere have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20039-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the inner workings of cyclones</a> over Japan, researchers report October 6 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The new imaging approach could lead to a better understanding of storms, the researchers say, and offer another tool to help meteorologists forecast the weather.</p>



<p>“Cosmic rays are sustainable natural resources that can be used everywhere on this planet for 24 hours [a day],” says geophysicist Hiroyuki Tanaka of the University of Tokyo, so it’s just a matter of taking advantage of them.</p>





<p>Muons offer a glimpse inside storms because variations in air pressure and density change the number of particles that make it through a tempest. By counting how many muons arrived at a detector on the ground in Kagoshima, Japan as cyclones moved past, Tanaka and colleagues produced rough 3-D maps of the density of air inside the storms. The approach gave the team an inside look at the low-pressure regions at the centers rotating storm systems.</p>



<p>Muons, which are similar to electrons but roughly 200 times as massive, can scatter off molecules in the air. They’re also unstable, which means they break down into electrons and other particles called neutrinos given enough time. As air pressure increases, so does its density. That, in turn, increases the chances that a muon born from a cosmic ray will be bumped off its path on the way toward a detector or get slowed enough that it breaks down before it makes it all the way through the atmosphere.</p>



<p>For every 1 percent increase in air pressure, Tanaka and colleagues say, the number of muons that survive passage from the upper atmosphere to the ground decreases by about 2 percent.</p>

The darkened portion was outside the viewing angle of the muon detector.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118570">©2022 H.K.M. Tanaka</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tanaka has previously used muons from cosmic rays to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">look inside volcanoes</a>, and he suspects that others have used the particles to study weather (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). But, he says, this appears to be the first time that anyone has made 3-D muon scans of the insides of a storm.</p>



<p>“It is an interesting approach,” says meteorologist Frank Marks of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>He doesn&#8217;t expect muon imaging to replace conventional meteorological measurements, but it’s another tool that scientists could use. “[It] would be complementary to our existing techniques to provide 3-D mapping of the storms with our other traditional observing systems, like satellites and radar.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-sciences-definitions-terms-research-measurment">Why fuzzy definitions are a problem in the social sciences</a></h4>

              
                <p>U.S. millennials are rejecting suburbia and moving back to the city. That was a prevailing idea in 2019, when I started as the social sciences reporter at <em>Science News</em>. But when I began digging into a possible story on the phenomenon, I encountered an incoherent mess. Some research showed that suburbs were growing, others that suburbs were shrinking and yet others showed growth in both suburbs and cities.</p>



<p>Unable to make sense of that maze of findings, I shelved the story idea. Then, several months later, I stumbled across a Harvard University white paper explaining that disagreement in the field stems from <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/working-papers/defining-suburbs-how-definitions-shape-suburban-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competing definitions</a> of what distinguishes a city from a suburb. Some researchers define the suburbs as areas falling outside census-designated cities. Others look only for markers of suburbanism, such as a wealth of single-family houses and car-based commutes, the researchers wrote.</p>





<p>I have encountered this type of fuzziness around definitions of all sorts of terms and concepts in the years I’ve covered the social sciences. Sometimes researchers simply assume that their definition of a key concept is <em>the </em>definition. Or they nod briefly at other definitions, and then go forth with whichever one they choose, without much explanation why. Other times, researchers in one subfield choose one definition, and researchers in another subfield choose a different one — each without ever knowing of the other’s existence. It’s enough to drive any reporter to tear their hair out.</p>



<p>“If you look … you will find this morass of definitions and measurements” in the social sciences, says quantitative psychologist Jessica Flake of McGill University in Montreal. My experience was a common one, she assured me.</p>



<p>Definitional morasses exist in other scientific fields too. Biologists frequently disagree about how best <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/defining-species-fuzzy-art">to define the word “species”</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/17</em>). Virologists squabble <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-alive-coronavirus-definition">over what counts as “alive” when it comes to viruses</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/21</em>). And not all astronomers are happy with the decision to define the word “planet” in a way that left <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">Pluto</a> out in the cold as a mere dwarf planet (<em>SN: 8/24/21</em>). </p>



<p>But the social sciences have some special challenges, Flake says. The field is a youngster compared with a discipline like astronomy, so has had less time to sort out its definitions. And social science concepts are often inherently subjective. Describing abstract ideas like motivation or feelings can be squishier than describing, say, a meteorite.</p>



<p>It’s tempting to assume, as I did until I began researching this column, that a single, imperfect definition for individual concepts is preferable to this definitional cacophony. And some researchers encourage this approach. “While no suburban definition will be perfect, <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/media/imp/Harvard_JCHS_Airgood-Obrycki_Rieger_Defining_Suburbs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standardization</a> would increase understanding of how suburban studies relate to each other,” the Harvard researchers wrote in that suburbia paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a recent study taking aim at how we define the middle class showed me how alternative definitions can lead to a shift in perspective.</p>



<p>While most researchers use income as a proxy for class, these researchers used people’s buying patterns. That revealed that a fraction of people who appear middle class by income struggle to pay for basic necessities, such as housing, child care and groceries, the team reported in July in <em>Social Indicators Research</em>. &nbsp;That is, they <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-022-02977-8#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live as if they are working class</a>.</p>



<p>What’s more, that vulnerable group skews Black and Hispanic, a disparity that arises, in part, because these families of color often lack the generational wealth of white families, says Melissa Haller, a geographer at Binghamton University in New York. So when calamity strikes, families without that financial cushion can struggle to recover. Yet a government or nonprofit organization looking to direct aid toward the neediest families, and relying solely on income-based metrics, would overlook this vulnerable group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Depending on what definition you start with, you will see different facts,” says Anna Alexandrova, a philosopher of science at the University of Cambridge. A standardized definition of middle class, for example, could obscure some of those key facts.</p>



<p>In the social sciences, what’s needed instead of conceptual unity, Alexandrova says, is conceptual clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though social scientists disagree about how to go about solving this problem of clarity, Flake says that failure to tackle the issue jeopardizes the field as much as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other crises</a> rocking the discipline (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>). That’s because how a topic is defined determines the scales, surveys and other instruments used to study that concept. And that in turn shapes how researchers crunch numbers and arrive at conclusions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Defining one’s key terms and then selecting the right tool is somewhat straightforward when relying on large, external datasets. For instance, instead of using national income databases, as is common in the study of the middle class, Haller and her team turned to the federal government’s Consumer Expenditure Surveys to understand people’s daily and emergency purchases.</p>



<p>But often social scientists, particularly psychologists, develop their own scales and surveys to quantify subjective concepts, such as self-esteem, mood or well-being. Definitions of those terms — and the instruments used to study them — can take on a life of their own, Flake says.</p>



<p>She and her team recently showed how this process plays out in the May-June <em>American Psychologist</em>. They combed through the 100 original studies and 100 replications included in a massive reproducibility project in psychology. The researchers zoomed in on 97 multi-item scales — measuring concepts such as gratitude, motivation and self-esteem — used in the original studies, and found that 54 of those scales had no citations to show where the scales originated. That suggests that the original authors defined their idea, and the tool used to measure that idea, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35482669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the fly</a>, Flake says. Research teams then attempted to replicate 29 of those studies without digging into the scales’ sources, calling into question the meaning of their results.</p>



<p>For Flake, the way to achieve conceptual clarity is straightforward, if unlikely. Researchers must hit the brakes on generating new ideas, or replicating old ideas, and instead interrogate the morass of old ones.</p>



<p>She points to one promising, if labor-intensive, effort: the <a href="https://psysciacc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psychological Science Accelerator</a>, a collaboration of over 1,300 researchers in 84 countries. The project aims to identify big ideas in psychology, such as face perception and gender prejudice, and accumulate all the instruments and resulting data used to make sense of those ideas in order to discard, refine or combine existing definitions and tools.</p>



<p>“Instead of running replications, why don’t we use [this] massive team of researchers who represent a lot of perspectives around the world and review concepts first,” Flake says. “We need to stop replicating garbage.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t agree more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delaware-sized-iceberg-antarctica-larsen">Here’s what happened to the Delaware-sized iceberg that broke off Antarctica</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the rift watched ‘round the world.</p>



<p>In July 2017, after weeks of anticipation, a massive iceberg about the size of Delaware <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delaware-sized-iceberg-breaks-antarctic-ice-shelf">split from the Antarctic Peninsula</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/17</em>). Satellite images show that the orphaned iceberg, known as A68, ultimately disintegrated in the Southern Ocean. Now, researchers say they have pieced together the powerful forces that led to that final breakup.</p>



<p>Polar scientist Alex Huth of Princeton University and colleagues combined observations of the iceberg’s drift with simulations of ocean currents and wind stress. Iceberg A68a, the largest remaining chunk of the original berg, was caught in a tug-of-war of ocean currents, and the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq6974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strain of those opposing forces probably pulled the iceberg apart</a>, the team reports October 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>After A68’s separation from the Larsen C ice shelf, researchers had questions — such as what creatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-expedition-search-life-larsen-c-ice-shelf-iceberg">live on the seafloor in the ice’s dark shadow</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/19</em>). As for the iceberg itself, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-iceberg-broke-antarctica-larsen-c-ice-shelf-stuck">took a while to get moving</a>, lingering in the neighborhood for about a year (<em>SN: 7/23/18</em>). By December 2020, satellite images show, the berg had clearly seen some action and was just two-thirds of its original size.</p>

<p>The new simulations suggest how A68a probably met its fate. On December 20, 2020, the long, slender “finger” at one end of the iceberg drifted into a strong, fast-moving current. The rest of the ice remained outside the current. The tension rifted the berg, and the finger sheared off and broke apart within a few days.</p>



<p>Shear stress is a previously unknown mechanism for large iceberg breakup, and isn’t represented in climate simulations, the team says. In the Southern Ocean, the melting of massive bergs can be a large source of cold freshwater to the ocean surface. That, in turn, can have a big impact on ocean circulation and the global climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-landslides-hidden-landscape-lasers">Landslides shaped a hidden landscape within Yellowstone</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>DENVER</strong> — A hidden landscape riddled with landslides is coming into focus in Yellowstone National Park, thanks to a laser-equipped airplane.</p>



<p>Scientists of yore crisscrossed Yellowstone on foot and studied aerial photographs to better understand America’s first national park. But today researchers have a massive new digital dataset at their fingertips that’s shedding new light on this nearly 1-million-hectare natural wonderland.</p>



<p>These observations of Yellowstone have allowed a pair of researchers to <a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2022AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/378704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pinpoint over 1,000 landslides within and near the park</a>, hundreds of which had not been mapped before, the duo reported October 9 at the Geological Society of America Connects 2022 meeting. Most of these landslides likely occurred thousands of years ago, but some are still moving.</p>





<p>Mapping Yellowstone’s landslides is important because they can cripple infrastructure like roadways and bridges. The millions of visitors that explore the park each year access Yellowstone through just a handful of entrance roads, one of which recently <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/flood-recovery.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed for months following intense flooding.</a></p>



<p>In 2020, a small aircraft flew a few hundred meters above the otherworldly landscape of Yellowstone. But it wasn’t ferrying tourists eager for up close views of the park’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-genes-ancestry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famous wolves</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-steamboat-geyser-reawakened-no-eruption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hydrothermal vents</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/20, SN: 1/11/21</em>). Instead, the plane carried a downward-pointing laser that fired pulses of infrared light at the ground. By measuring the timing of pulses that hit the ground and reflected back toward the aircraft, researchers reconstructed the precise topography of the landscape.</p>



<p>Such “light detection and ranging,” or lidar, data reveal details that often remain hidden to the eye. “We’re able to see the surface of the ground as if there’s no vegetation,” says Kyra Bornong, a geoscientist at Idaho State University in Pocatello. Similar lidar observations have been used to pinpoint <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-Columbian settlements deep within the Amazon jungle</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>The Yellowstone lidar data were collected as part of the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D Elevation Program</a>, an ongoing project spearheaded by the United States Geological Survey to map the entirety of the United States using lidar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Slip and slide</h3>



<p>Laser-mapping of the Yellowstone area uncovered over 1,000 landslides (outlined in yellow), most within the national park. This topographical map (red denotes higher elevations; blue is lower) reveals that many of the landslides are concentrated around the edges of the park. While most are ancient, some are still active.</p>



<h6>Mapping Yellowstone&#8217;s hidden landslides</h6>

Bornong and B. Crosby/Idaho State Univ., USGS</span></figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>Bornong and geomorphologist Ben Crosby analyzed the Yellowstone data — which resolve details as small as about one meter — to home in on landslides. The team searched for places where the landscape changed from looking relatively smooth to looking jumbled, evidence that soil and rocks had once been on the move. “It’s a pattern-recognition game,” says Crosby, also of Idaho State University. “You’re looking for this contrast between the lumpy stuff and the smooth stuff.”</p>



<p>The researchers spotted more than 1,000 landslides across Yellowstone, most of which were clustered near the periphery of the park. That makes sense given the geography of Yellowstone’s interior, says Lyman Persico, a geomorphologist at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., who was not involved in the research. The park <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sinking-melting-ancient-tectonic-plate-may-fuel-yellowstones-supervolcano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sits atop a supervolcano</a>, whose previous eruptions blanketed much of the park in lava (<em>SN: 1/2/18</em>). “You’re sitting in the middle of the Yellowstone caldera, where everything is flat,” says Persico.</p>



<p>But steep terrain also abounds in the national park, and there’s infrastructure in many of those landslide-prone areas. In several places, the team found that roads had been built over landslide debris. One example is Highway 191, which skirts the western edge of Yellowstone. </p>

<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on this highway since it funnels significant amounts of traffic through regions apt to experience landslides, Bornong says. “It’s one of the busiest roads in Montana.”</p>



<p>There’s plenty more to learn from this novel look at Yellowstone, Crosby says. Lidar data can shed light on geologic processes like volcanic and tectonic activity, both of which Yellowstone has in spades. “It’s a transformative tool,” he says.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982117351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Song of the Cell</a><br><em>Siddhartha Mukherjee<br>Scribner, $32.50</em></p>



<p>In the summer of 1960, doctors extracted “crimson sludge” from 6-year-old Barbara Lowry’s bones and gave it to her twin.</p>



<p>That surgery, one of the first successful bone marrow transplants, belied the difficulty of the procedure. In the early years of transplantation, scores of patients died as doctors struggled to figure out how to use one person’s cells to treat another. “Cell therapy for blood diseases had a terrifying birth,” Siddhartha Mukherjee writes in his new book, <em>The Song of the Cell</em>.</p>





<p>The transplant story is one of many Mukherjee uses to put human faces and experiences at the heart of medical progress. But what radiates off the pages is the author himself. An oncologist, researcher and Pulitzer Prize–winning author, Mukherjee’s curiosity and wisdom add pep to what, in less dexterous hands, might be dry material. He finds wonder in every facet of cell biology, inspiration in the people working in this field and “spine-tingling awe” in their discoveries.</p>





<p>It’s no surprise that Mukherjee is so seduced by science. This is a man who built a microscope from scratch during the pandemic and has spent years probing biology and its history with luminaries in the field. <em>The Song of the Cell </em>lets readers eavesdrop on these conversations, which can be intimate and enlightening.</p>



<p>On a car ride across the Netherlands, Mukherjee chats with geneticist <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biology-two-new-books-why-hard-define-life-meaning">Paul Nurse</a>, who tells him about the cell division work that ultimately netted Nurse a Nobel Prize (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 28</em>). On a walk at Rockefeller University in New York</p>



<p>City, Mukherjee discusses his depression with another Nobel Prize–winning researcher, neuroscientist Paul Greengard. Mukherjee’s vivid imagery lends heft to his feelings. He tells Greengard about experiencing a “soupy fog of grief” after his father’s death and describes “drowning in a tide of sadness.”</p>



<p>In these memories, which Mukherjee uses to segue into the science of depression, and elsewhere in the book, hints of poetry shimmer among the prose. A cell observed under a microscope is “refulgent, glimmering, alive.” A white blood cell’s slow creep is like the “ectoplasmic movement of an alien.” Mukherjee weaves his experiences into the story of cell biology, guiding readers through the lives and discoveries of key figures in the field. We meet the “father of microbiology,” Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a 17th century cloth merchant who ground globules of Venetian glass into microscope lenses and spied a “marvelous cosmos of a living world” within a raindrop. Mukherjee also teleports us to the present to introduce He Jiankui, the disgraced biophysicist behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-edited-babies-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the world’s first gene-edited babies</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 20</em>). Along the way, we also meet Frances Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration medical officer who refused to approve thalidomide, a drug now known to cause birth defects, for use in the United States, and Lynn Margulis, the evolutionary biologist who argued that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">mitochondria and other organelles were once free-living bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 8/8/15, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Mukherjee traverses a vast landscape of cell biology, and he’s not afraid to pull over and go exploring in the weeds. He describes in detail the flux of ions in nerve cells and introduces a considerable cast of immune system characters. For an even deeper dive, readers can check the footnotes; they are abundant.</p>



<p>What stands out most, though, are Mukherjee’s stories about people: scientists, doctors, patients and himself. As a researcher and a physician, he steps deftly between the scientific and clinical worlds, and, like the microscope he assembled, offers a glimpse into a universe we might not otherwise see.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-week-2022/">For OA Week 2022, PLOS explores how Open Science can advance Climate Justice</a></h4>

              
                <p>This <a href="https://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access (OA) Week</a> (October 21-24), we explore the theme &ldquo;Open For Climate Justice.&rdquo; The climate crisis is a topic of global significance, which Open Science is particularly well-suited to address. Read on for more on how climate researchers are leveraging Open Science or <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/OA-Week-2022/#events">skip ahead</a> for a look at our climate-related OA Week content.</p>



<h2>Open Access, Open Science and climate research</h2>



<p>Open Access (OA) makes research accessible immediately upon publication with no restrictions. Anyone with internet access can find, read, mine, cite and share OA articles at no cost to them. Choosing to publish under an <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-access/">OA license</a> advances information equity by making your research more visible, useful, and more transparent. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science</a> expands these benefits to content beyond formal research articles, such as data, methods, code, and earlier versions of the manuscript.</p>



<p>For climate research, the immediacy, reach, and demonstrable rigor that Open Science offers is particularly vital.</p>



<h3>In climate research, every moment counts and all research matters</h3>



<p>The climate is in crisis. The timely and thorough exchange of knowledge can help to meet that challenge by accelerating advancement, supporting high-quality work, and directing scarce research funds where they are needed most. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">Preregistering</a> a study stakes a claim on a particular investigative pathway, while peer review at the study design phase refines methods for the most rigorous research possible. Posting <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">preprints</a> communicates results sooner and opens studies for broader, more inclusive peer review. Publishing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/research-revealed/">negative, null, and confirmatory research</a> limits unnecessary duplication, while reinforcing the validity of previous results.</p>



<h3>Climate researchers care deeply about impact</h3>



<p>In order to create change, climate researchers must reach not only colleagues in their own fields, but researchers in other disciplines and regions, educators, policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Open Science maximizes the impact of research through immediate, broad discoverability, access, sharing, and reuse.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Climate researchers look for ways to practice transparency and demonstrate credibility</h3>



<p>Although the scientific community reached a consensus on the reality of the climate change crisis more than 20 years ago, researchers in these fields continue to face doubt and criticism fueled by unscrupulous politicking. Open Science empowers researchers to facilitate reproducibility and demonstrate the rigor and validity of their own research, by sharing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">data</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/">methods</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-code/">code</a>, and other artifacts from the research process. By choosing to publish <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/">Peer Review History</a>, authors can illustrate the thoroughness of editorial assessment their work has undergone prior to publication.</p>



<h2>Climate Science at PLOS</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve long recognized the importance of openness to the climate crisis. It&rsquo;s why, in 2021, we opened three new community-driven journals focused on cross disciplinary research touching on the health of our planet: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/"><em>PLOS Water</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a>. This OA Week, explore climate research and thought leadership from PLOS:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-risk-nih-recover-symptoms">What is long COVID and who’s at risk? This NIH project may find out</a></h4>

              
                <p>You may have heard the big long COVID news that came out recently: A Scottish study reported that about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33415-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half of people infected with SARS-CoV-2</a> have not fully recovered six to 18 months after infection. That result echoes what many doctors and patients have been saying for months. Long COVID is a serious problem and a huge number of people are dealing with it. </p>



<p>But it’s tough to find treatments for a disease that is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still so ill-defined</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). One major research effort in the United States hopes to change that. And one of my colleagues, <em>Science News</em>’ News Director <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/macon-morehouse">Macon Morehouse</a>, got a peek into the process.</p>





<p>In the last two months, Morehouse has donated 15 vials of blood, two urine specimens and a sample of saliva. Technicians have measured her blood pressure, oxygen level, height, weight and waist circumference and counted how many times she could rise from sitting to standing in 30 seconds. Morehouse is not sick, nor is she collecting data for her health. She’s doing it for science.</p>



<p>Morehouse is participating in a long COVID study at Howard University in Washington D.C. It’s part of a many-armed giant of a project with an eye on one thing: the long-term health effects of COVID-19. Launched last year by the National Institutes of Health, the <a href="https://recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RECOVER Initiative</a> aims to enroll roughly 60,000 adults and children. At the Howard site, Morehouse is volunteer No. 182.</p>



<p>She’s somewhat of a unicorn among study participants: As far as she knows, Morehouse has never had COVID-19. Ultimately, some 10 percent of participants will include people who have avoided the virus, says Stuart Katz, a cardiologist and a RECOVER study leader at NYU Langone Health in New York City. Scientists continue to sign up volunteers, but “omicron made it harder to find uninfected people,” he says.</p>



<p>RECOVER scientists need participants like Morehouse so the researchers can compare them with people who developed long COVID. That might reveal what the disease is — and who it tends to strike. “Our goals are to define long COVID and to understand what’s your risk of getting [it] after COVID infection,” Katz says. Their results could be a first step toward developing treatments.</p>



<h4>Tight timeline</h4>



<p>Within the pandemic’s first year, doctors noticed that some COVID-19 patients developed long-term symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue and chronic cough. In December 2020, Katz and other physicians and scientists convened to discuss what was known. The answer, it turned out, was not much. “This is a novel virus,” he says. “Nobody knew what it could do.” Around the same time, Congress OK’d $1.15 billion for the NIH to study COVID-19’s long-term health consequences.</p>



<p>Fast forward five months, and the agency had awarded nearly $470 million to NYU Langone Health to serve as the hub for its long COVID studies. “The whole thing was on a very, very compressed timeline,” Katz says. NYU then hustled to come up with a study plan focused on three main groups: adults, children/families and finally, tissue samples from people who died after having COVID-19. It wasn’t your typical research project, Katz says. “We were charged with studying a disease that didn&#8217;t have a definition.”</p>



<p>Today, RECOVER has enrolled just over half of a target 17,680 adults. Katz hopes to cross this finish line by spring 2023. The child-focused part of the project has further to go. The goal is to enroll nearly 20,000 children; so far, they’ve got around 1,200, says Diana Bianchi, director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and a member of RECOVER’s executive committee.</p>

<p>Some scientists and patients <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/03/29/nih-long-covid-sluggish-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have criticized RECOVER</a> for moving <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/long-covid-national-crisis-so-why-are-grants-taking-so-long-get" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too slowly</a>. As someone who has recovered from long COVID himself, Katz says he gets it. “We started a year and a half ago, and we don’t yet have definitive answers,” he says. “For people that have been suffering, I can understand how it’s disappointing.”</p>



<p>But for RECOVER — with more than 400 doctors, scientists and other experts involved, roughly 180 sites across the country enrolling participants and a grant timeline that scuttled the usual order of events — the old saying about building the plane while flying it fits, Katz says. “We are working very, very hard to move as quickly as we can.”</p>



<h4>Looking for answers</h4>



<p>Recently, other facets of the initiative have started to shine. An analysis of electronic health records found that among people under 21, kids younger than 5, kids with certain medical conditions and those who had had severe COVID-19 infections may be <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2795569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most at risk for long COVID</a>, scientists reported in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> in August. And a different health records study suggests that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.22280795v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccinated adults have some protection against long COVID</a>, even if they had a breakthrough infection. Scientists posted that finding this month at medRxiv.org in a study that has yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>



<p>These studies tap data that have already been collected. The bulk of the RECOVER studies will take longer, because scientists will follow patients for years, analyzing data along the way. “These are observational, longitudinal studies,” Katz says. “There’s no intervention; we’re basically just trying to understand what long COVID is.”</p>



<p>Still, Katz expects to see early results later this fall. By then, scientists should have an official, if rough, definition of long COVID, which could help doctors struggling to diagnose the disease. By the end of the year, Katz says RECOVER might also have answers about viral persistence — whether coronavirus relics left behind in the body somehow reboot symptoms.</p>



<p>The project has also recently sprouted a clinical trials arm, which may launch this winter, says Kanecia Zimmerman, a pediatric critical care specialist who is leading this effort at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in North Carolina. One of the first trials planned will test whether an antiviral therapy that clears SARS-CoV-2 from the body helps patients with persistent symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though RECOVER is a major effort to understand long COVID, progress will require research — and ideas — from a broad group of scientists, says Diane Griffin, a microbiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and member of the <a href="https://lc19.org/team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Long COVID Research Initiative</a>, who is not involved in the project. “Just because we’ve invested in this one big study, that’s not going to give us all the answers,” she says.</p>



<p>But information from study participants like Morehouse and the nearly 10,000 other adults who’ve already enrolled in RECOVER will help. In the meantime, continued support for long COVID research is crucial, Griffin says. “That’s the only way we’re going to eventually figure this out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-stretch-particle-physics-quarks">Protons may be stretchier than physics predicts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons might be stretchier than they should be.</p>



<p>The subatomic particles are built of smaller particles called quarks, which are bound together by a powerful interaction known as the strong force. New experiments seem to show that the quarks <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05248-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">respond more than expected to an electric field pulling on them</a>, physicist Nikolaos Sparveris and colleagues report October 19 in <em>Nature</em>. The result suggests that the strong force isn’t quite as strong as theory predicts.</p>



<p>It’s a finding at odds with the standard model of particle physics, which describes the particles and forces that combine to make up us and everything around us. The result has some physicists stumped about how to explain it — or whether to even try.</p>





<p>“It is certainly puzzling for the physics of the strong interaction, if this thing persists,” says Sparveris, of Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>Such stretchiness has turned up in other labs’ experiments, but wasn’t as convincing, Sparveris says. The stretchiness that he and his colleagues measured was less extreme than in previous experiments, but also came with less experimental uncertainty. That increases the researchers’ confidence that protons are indeed stretchier than theory says they should be.</p>



<p>At the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Va., the team probed protons by firing electrons at a target of ultracold liquid hydrogen. Electrons scattering off protons in the hydrogen revealed how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-particle-physics-proton-gluon-quarks-force" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the protons’ quarks</a> respond to electric fields (<em>SN: 9/13/22</em>). The higher the electron energy, the deeper the researchers could see into the protons, and the more the electrons revealed about how the strong force works inside protons.</p>



<p>For the most part, the quarks moved as expected when electric interactions pulled the particles in opposite directions. But at one point, as the electron energy was ramped up, the quarks appeared to respond more strongly to an electric field than theory predicted they would. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But it only happened for a small range of electron energies, leading to a bump in a plot of the proton’s stretch.</p>



<p>“Usually, behaviors of these things are quite, let’s say, smooth and there are no bumps,” says physicist Vladimir Pascalutsa of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany.</p>



<p>Pascalutsa says he’s often eager to dive into puzzling problems, but the odd stretchiness of protons is too sketchy for him to put pencil to paper at this time. “You need to be very, very inventive to come up with a whole framework which somehow finds you a new effect” to explain the bump, he says. “I don’t want to kill the buzz, but yeah, I’m quite skeptical as a theorist that this thing is going to stay.”</p>



<p>It will take more experiments to get theorists like him excited about unusually stretchy protons, Pascalutsa says. He could get his wish if Sparveris’ hopes are fulfilled to try the experiment again with positrons, the antimatter version of electrons, scattered from protons instead.</p>



<p>A different type of experiment altogether might make stretchy protons more compelling, Pascalutsa says. A forthcoming study from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, could do the trick. It will use hydrogen atoms that have muons in place of the electrons that usually orbit atoms’ nuclei. Muons are about 200 times as heavy as electrons, and orbit much closer to the nucleus of an atom than do electrons — offering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-size-still-perplexes-despite-new-measurement">a closer look at the proton inside</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>). The experiment would involve stimulating the “muonic hydrogen” with lasers rather than scattering other electrons or positrons from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The precision in the muonic hydrogen experiments will be much higher than whatever can be achieved in scattering experiments,” Pascalutsa says. If the stretchiness turns up there as well, “then I would start to look at this right away.”</p>
