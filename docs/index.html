<p>In the lab, psychologists have shown how generosity propagates and spreads. If someone is kind to us, we tend to “<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20364907">pay it forward</a>” and act more generously to someone else when given the chance. But it’s not clear if these findings are realistic. For example, when we’re juggling priorities on a busy work day, might receiving an act of kindness actually be a nuisance, leaving us feeling indebted to return the favour when we’ve got more important things to do? An uplifting <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24716-001/">new study</a> in the journal <i>Emotion</i> looks at acts of altruism within a real-life working environment, and shows how kindness really does ripple outwards from a good deed.</p>
<p><span id="more-26238"></span></p>
<p>The researchers from the University of California headed by Joseph Chancellor studied workers from Coca Cola’s Madrid site, a group of mostly female employees from a range of departments. Participants were told they were part of a happiness study, and once a week for four weeks they checked in to report how they were feeling, in terms of mood and life satisfaction, and their experience of positive and negative behaviours, including how many they had carried out towards others, and how many others had made towards them. Four weeks later, the participants completed further measures, such as of their happiness and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to most of the group, 19 of the participants were in cahoots with the researchers: they were “givers” whose task each week was to perform acts of kindness towards some of their co-workers (they were to refrain from showing kindness to other co-workers who served as a control group). It was up to the givers what generous acts they performed – Chancellor’s team wanted to make sure these participants had autonomy in what they did, rather than obeying an injunction (we know that <a href="http://https//digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/11/pressuring-employees-to-be-do-gooders-can-backfire-badly/">this can turn out badly</a>) – examples of the favours they performed included bringing someone a drink, and emailing a thank-you note.</p>
<p>So what did a month of extra kindness mean for the workers who were on the receiving end, for the givers, and for the organisation as a whole?</p>
<p>The acts of kindness don’t go unnoticed. The receivers observed more prosocial behaviours in the office and by the end of the study, they were reporting ten times more prosocial behaviours than the controls. In addition, receivers’ level of “felt autonomy” – essentially how much they felt in control of their days at work – were higher than controls over the course of the study, although it’s worth noting that this was because autonomy dropped in controls while it held steady in the receivers (Seth Margolis, a co-author on the paper, told me that work conditions were likely getting harder over the study period, with the acts of kindness acting as a buffer). One month after the study ended, the receivers were also enjoying significantly higher levels of happiness than controls.</p>
<p>Giving was itself rewarding, and on some indicators more rewarding than receiving. The givers saw the same preserved autonomy enjoyed by receivers, and additionally saw benefit to their sense of competency (again relative to declining control scores) – presumably decorating Nuria’s monitor with a smiley face made of post-its reminds you of your creative potential. The givers’ one-month followup measures were also more impressive than the receivers’: they enjoyed higher levels of life satisfaction and job satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms. This suggests that in this context, giving had a more durable effect than receiving.  This shouldn’t be so surprising, as evidence suggests <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5870/1687">we feel happier when spending money on others than ourselves</a>, and acts of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2014.983959">kindness increase autonomy and competence</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, and consistent with past lab studies, the research showed that receivers didn’t just enjoy acts of kindness – they paid them forward. By the end of the study, the receivers reported engaging in nearly three times more prosocial behaviours than did the controls. If this were direct reciprocity – Nuria figuring out who got busy with the smiley stickies on her monitor and fetching them a coffee as a thank you – then we would expect to see the givers reporting many more positive behaviours by study end. But they didn’t, suggesting that the acts were paid forward to someone other than the original giver, due to a sense of elevation and desire to participate in an organisation that was treating them in an ideal way. This contributes to the idea that while there are individual origins of prosociality, there is also a strong contagious quality to it, moving socially through groups, in much the way that phenomena such as <a href="http://https//digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/11/when-and-why-does-rudeness-sometimes-spread-round-the-office/">rudeness</a> and even <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652652">obesity</a> have been shown to do.</p>
<p>So workplace acts of kindness – freely chosen – appear to be a way to create virtuous cycles within organisations, benefiting the recipients, the givers, and the climate at large. Just get the goodness started, and enjoy its growth all around you.</p>

The medical journal Prenatal Diagnosis recently played host to a vigorous debate over whether a male fetus was spotted engaging in masturbation on ultrasound.





The alleged case of antenatal autoeroticism was reported by Spanish gynecologists Vanesa Rodríguez Fernández and Carlos López Ramón y Cajal in September last year. Their paper was called In utero gratification behaviour in male fetus. Here's the ultrasonic evidence of the act:

<p>The brain shows a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental stimuli that is critical to the process of learning and memory. This flexibility is attributable in part to rapid modifications of neuronal structure and function. A recent study has illuminated how these rapid changes take place, involving the storage of a readily releasable pool of RNA transcripts in the nucleus of neurons. </p>
<p>The brain is a plastic organ that undergoes frequent structural and functional modifications in response to input from the environment. Neuronal activity produces changes in the expression of proteins at <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/09/17/the-synapse-volume-1-issue-7/">synapses</a> and in the connections between neurons. This plasticity relies on the transcription of different genes, which involves the production of messenger (mRNA) from DNA. The level of specific mRNA transcripts can be measured to determine when a gene is turned on or off.</p>
<p>In response to neuronal activity, two waves of mRNA are produced: immediate early genes, and activity-regulated transcripts. The first set of transcripts are made in approximately 30-60 minutes in response to neuronal activity.  Some of these mRNAs encode transcription factors that activate another transcription cascade to produce proteins involved in growth, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/05/could-targeting-mitochondria-be-the-key-to-treating-psychosis/">cell signaling</a>, and synaptic function. Neuronal activity can also modify transcription through alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can encode multiple proteins. Each gene contains multiple introns and exons. Introns are excised before the final RNA sequence is translated to protein. Different combinations of exons can remain following intron removal, and each combination will produce a different protein.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that neuronal cells express a large number of long genes (&gt;100 kilobases) that encode proteins important for synaptic function. Since genes of this length would require several hours to transcribe, this raised the question of how plastic changes occur so rapidly. This is the question Oriane Mauger and colleagues sought to answer in their recent study, “<a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(16)30900-X">Targeted Intron Retention and Excision for Rapid Gene Regulation in Response to Neuronal Activity</a>,” published in the journal <em>Neuron</em>.</p>
<p>The study, led by Peter Scheiffele from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, investigated whether alternative splicing is involved in rapid <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/28/neuronal-transplantation-may-restore-brain-functionality/">neuronal plasticity</a>. Alternative splicing takes only seconds to a few minutes, and occurs during transcription. One type of alternative splicing is intron retention, where introns are retained in fully transcribed, mature transcripts. These transcripts are identified by the presence of a stretch of adenine bases, called the polyA+ tail, at the end of the mRNA sequence.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of intron retention in plasticity, the researchers first isolated and sequenced mature polyadenylated RNA sequences from <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/02/26/the-chattering-brain-how-chronic-pain-throws-our-cortex-out-of-sync/">brain cortex</a> samples. The samples were isolated from mice on postnatal day 10 (juvenile) and day 50 (adult), and from 16.5-day-old mouse embryos that had been cultured for 2 weeks. They calculated the number of transcripts that were spliced and the number that retained introns. The intron-retaining (IR) transcripts made up 5-6% of all of the isolated transcripts.</p>
<p>They then treated cells with transcription inhibitors and found that the majority (84%) of intron retention events persisted. They theorized that these retained introns might be excised in response to neuronal activity in order to rapidly modify gene expression. They tested this hypothesis by treating cells with bicuculline, a drug that increases neuronal network activity. Some introns showed increased retention, while others were excised in response to neuronal stimulation. These results were validated for several specific transcripts, showing that the excision of <em>Clk1</em>, <em>Fnbp11</em>, and <em>Tia1</em> occurred rapidly in response to bicuculline. Using drug treatments, the researchers  were also able to show that activity-dependent intron excision is triggered by calcium signaling downstream of synaptic glutamate receptors, called NMDA receptors.</p>
<p>A gene ontology analysis was performed to see what categories of genes were modified by activity-dependent intron excision. In instances where an intron was excised in response to neuronal activity, these genes were shown to be involved in cell signaling and cellular architecture, including <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/">microtubule</a> proteins, actin cytoskeleton proteins, phosphoisositide 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and Rho.</p>
<p>Cell fractionation experiments were performed to determine where in the cell the intron-containing transcripts were located. These experiments showed the presence of these transcripts in the cell nucleus. Neuronal stimulation caused an increase in the number of spliced transcripts in the cytosol, suggesting that they were exported. These cytosolic transcripts were found to be associated with ribosomes, indicating that they were being translated, or turned into protein.</p>
<p>Altogether, these experiments showed that a pool of mature DNA transcripts retain their introns. These introns are rapidly excised in response to neuronal activity, and the spliced RNA is transported to the cytoplasm for translation to protein. This mechanism allows new proteins to be rapidly generated in response to neuronal activity, modifying cellular architecture and supporting plasticity.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Aerial_view_of_the_Amazon_Rainforest-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Tropical forests are the richest terrestrial ecosystems on earth and home to millions of different plant and animal species. At the same time, these regions are the most endangered terrestrial habitats worldwide. They harbour the highest percentage of endemic species and many of them are thus listed as biodiversity hotspots (exceptionally rich but threatened ecosystems).</p>
<p>Pristine tropical forests are decreasing with dramatic speed and often only mosaics of small remnants remain, embedded within agricultural areas and human settlements. This dramatic conversion of pristine forest habitats is a worldwide phenomenon and notably the most important driver of the current biodiversity crisis. Many species of different taxa are declining or even went extinct during the last decades. However, not all species are declining, and some survive successfully or even increase in abundance in these strongly disturbed habitats.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9235" style="width: 2010px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9235" height="1500" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/fig1_ricefields_reduced.jpg" width="2000" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The loss of pristine tropical forests is mostly caused by the conversion of habitat to e.g. agricultural landscapes like rice fields.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Mark-Oliver Rödel</div></figure>
<p>Due to their semi-permeable skin and mostly biphasic life-cycle with aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults, amphibians are particularly influenced by their environment. Thus the loss and alteration of their natural habitats, but also the on-going global climate change, are making them highly vulnerable. Although the most threatened class of vertebrates, not all amphibians disappear in human-altered landscapes. The question is, why do different species respond to environmental change so differently?</p>
<p>Many studies target the threatened species, the losers, but usually nobody cares about the winners, although it is most likely these species which will dominate the globes’ future ecosystems. We were therefore interested to uncover the reasons for being a successful species in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>We used a unique pantropical data set, comprising published records and our own data on frog species occurrences in tropical forests, forest fragments, and more intensely altered landscapes such as plantations or settlements. For these species we gathered life-history (e.g. body size, clutch size) and ecological traits (e.g. preferred habitat) as well as distribution data, all of which might influence the response of a species to forest degradation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_9236" style="width: 591px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9236 size-full" height="266" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/fig2_frogs.jpg" width="581" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Frog species with different forest dependencies. The Variable Squeaker Frog (<em>Arthroleptis variabilis</em>, left) is widely distributed, does not depend on streams due its direct development, prefers the leaf litter, and is thus according to our results not dependent on pristine forests; Mertens Egg Frog (<em>Leptodactylodon mertensi</em>, right) is in comparison more limited in its distribution, its tadpoles develop in streams, adults live in the leaf litter, and might thus tolerate forest disturbance to some extent.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Mareike Hirschfeld</div></figure>
<p>By using a combination of different statistical approaches, we revealed that those species with indirect development (species with tadpoles), that occur over large ranges and wide elevational distribution, being further independent of streams, and inhabiting the leaf litter, cope best with modifications of their natural habitats. Species sharing these traits will likely persist in altered tropical forest systems.</p>
<p>These findings will help to predict future frog communities and thus identify the species with an increasing effect on ecosystems and their functioning in our human-dominated world.</p>

<p>Up and down the land parents and teenagers are engaged in tense negotiation and diplomacy in an effort to maintain domestic peace. Some households are finding more success than others. Their secret, according to a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191730191X?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new paper</a> in <em>NeuroImage</em>, is a literal meeting of minds – synchronisation of brain cell firing seems to foster emotional harmony. Moreover, when parents and their teenagers display this “neural similarity”, write Tae-Ho Lee and his colleagues, “this promotes youths’ psychological adjustment”.</p>
<p>These are intriguing findings – in the fact the researchers claim this is the first time that anyone has compared the brain activity of parent-child dyads with their interpersonal relations. However, sceptics will baulk at the rampant neuro-reductionism and at the paper’s repeated claims of brain-based causation on the basis of purely correlational evidence.</p>
<p><span id="more-26110"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 31 teens and their primary caregiver. The latter was always either the teen’s mother or father, genetically related to them. The average age of the parents was 43 years and just under 90 per cent were mothers. The teens were a roughly 50-50 mix of boys and girls, with an average age of 15.</p>
<p>Each parent and teen participant underwent a 6-minute brain scan in which they lay still and looked at a cross on a screen. From this, the researchers identified each person’s resting state “connectome” showing the patterns of neural firing across the brain and the functional connectivity between 13 different brain networks (the researchers described this as showing each participant’s “unique brain fingerprint”).</p>
<p>For two weeks, every teen and parent also kept a daily diary, reporting their positive and negative moods. The teens also completed an “emotional competence” questionnaire about their ability to identify and describe their feelings.</p>
<p>Ho Lee and his team looked at the emotional synchrony between each parent-child dyad – whether they tended to report the same kinds of emotions each night or not – and found plenty of variability. Some dyads showed a lot of similarity, others were completely out of kilter. The researchers also looked at the level of similarity in the brain connectomes of each parent-teen pair, finding that some were more “neurally in-tune” than others.</p>
<p>The two measures correlated, as in the parent-teen pairs who showed greater emotional synchrony also tended to show greater neural synchrony. “We propose that children’s neural connectome is a psychological representation at the neural systems level, resulting from shared experiences with their primary caregiver,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>There was also a correlation between greater neural synchrony between parent and teen and the teen’s level’s of emotional competence.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers conducted a mediation analysis, which is a statistical technique for testing how factors might be associated. This showed that neural synchrony was linked to greater emotional competence via emotional synchrony (consistent with the possibility that neural similarity fosters emotional synchrony, which leads to greater emotional competence). In contrast, the analysis suggested that neural synchrony did not  mediate the association between parent-teen emotional synchrony and teens’ emotional competence (in other words, this is not consistent with the idea that emotional synchrony breeds neural synchrony, which fosters greater emotional competence).</p>
<p>Based on this, the researchers made repeated causal claims, such as: “dyadic brain similarity plays an important role in children’s emotional competence <em>by contributing to</em> more synchronised emotional mood fluctuations”; and “We provide the first empirical evidence unpacking how the brain’s functional organisation is shared between individuals and influences emotional synchrony, ultimately <em>conferring benefits</em> for youths’ development”; and “the degree of neural similarity in parent-child dyads <em>promotes</em> youths’ psychological adjustment” (all emphases added).</p>
<p>However, this is a purely correlational study so there’s no way to know if any of the factors – parent-teen emotional synchrony, parent-teen neural synchrony, teen emotional competence – are causally related. Mediation analysis is no substitute for data derived from longitudinal and/or experimental methods. Yes, it is fascinating to see how complex emotional relations between parents and their teens may manifest at a neural level, but it seems overly reductionist and simplistic to claim that brain activity is the root cause of everything else.</p>
<p>Even assuming that neural synchrony between parents and teens really is an important influence on parent-teen harmony and teens’ psychological adjustment, it’s hard to imagine, from a clinical or everyday perspective, that this is a particularly useful or practical level at which to think about or intervene in family life.</p>

Five years ago I blogged about the debate over whether the blue-for-boys, pink-for-girls color convention used to be the other way around. My post focused on a 2012 paper by psychologist Marco Del Giudice arguing that the idea of a cultural "pink–blue reversal" in the English-speaking world in the early 20th century is a myth.



Now, Del Giudice has published an 'update' revisiting the issue. Based on text data from late 19th and early 20th century American newspapers and magazines, Del Giu

How do you tally up 70,000 thoughts? Do some thoughts last 10 seconds, while others are finished in one tenth of a second?<br /><br />Over 24 hours, one thought per second would yield 86,400 thoughts. If  “thoughts” are restricted to 16 waking hours, the number would be 57,600. But we're almost certainly thinking while we're dreaming (for about <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep" target="_blank">two hours</a> every night), so that would be 64,800  seconds, with an ultimate result of one thought every 0.9257 seconds, on average.<br /><br /><a href="http://loni.usc.edu/" target="_blank">LONI<sub>®</sub></a>, the Laboratory of Neuroimaging at USC, included this claim on their <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170313053429/http://loni.usc.edu/about_loni/education/brain_trivia.php" target="_blank">Brain Trivia</a> page, so perhaps it's all their fault.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">How many thoughts does the average person have per day?<br /><sup style="color: dodgerblue; font-weight: 900;">*</sup>70,000<br /><br /><div style="color: dodgerblue; font-weight: 500; margin: 20px auto;"><sup>*</sup>This is still an open question (how many thoughts does the average human brain processes in 1 day). LONI faculty have done some very preliminary studies using undergraduate student volunteers and have estimated that one may expect around 60-70K thoughts per day. These results are not peer-reviewed/published. There is no generally accepted definition of what "thought" is or how it is created. In our study, we had assumed that a "thought" is a sporadic single-idea cognitive concept resulting from the act of thinking, or produced by spontaneous systems-level cognitive brain activations.</div></blockquote><br />Neuroskeptic tried to find the origin of <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/05/09/the-70000-thoughts-per-day-myth/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The 70,000 Thoughts Per Day Myth?">The 70,000 Thoughts Per Day Myth</a> five years ago.

We  shouldn't be relying on descriptions of mental events to define a  thought, but rather discrete brain states.<br /><br /><br />Using this definition, “a thought” is what you can capture with your fancy new imaging technique. Therefore, a thought conveniently occupies the available temporal resolution of your method:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“A thought or a cognitive function usually lasts 30 seconds or a minute.  That’s the range of what we’re hoping to be able to capture,” <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-tool-offers-snapshots-neuron-activity-0626" target="_blank">says Kay Tye</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive  Sciences at MIT. </blockquote>In this case, the method is <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3909.html" target="_blank" title="A light- and calcium-gated transcription factor for imaging and manipulating activated neurons">FLARE</a>, “an engineered transcription factor that drives expression of fluorescent  proteins, opsins, and other genetically encoded tools only in the  subset of neurons that experienced activity during a user-defined time  window” (Wang et al., 2017). <br /><br /><br />But what if your method records <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/18179.long" target="_blank">EEG microstates</a>, “short periods (100 ms) during which the EEG scalp topography remains quasi-stable” (Van De Ville et al., 2010). In this case, thoughts are assembled from EEG microstates:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">One characteristic feature of EEG microstates is the rapid transition  from one scalp field topography into another, leading                               to the hypothesis that they constitute the  “basic building blocks of cognition” or “atoms of thought” that  underlie spontaneous                               conscious cognitive activity.</blockquote><br />And for good measure, studies of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725466" target="_blank">mind wandering</a>, spontaneous thought, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">default mode network</a> are flourishing.

It seems unequivocal. But even a slight reflection shows it to have more than one meaning. No sooner do we ask the question than we begin to vacillate. Indeed, the ambiguity of the question foils every attempt to push toward the answer without some further preparation.<br /><br />- Martin Heidegger, <a href="http://thegreatthinkers.org/heidegger/major-works/called-thinking/" target="_blank"><i>What Is Called Thinking?</i></a></blockquote><br />Philosophers have filled thousands of pages addressing this question, so clearly we're way beyond the depth and scope of this post. My focus here is more narrow, “thought” in the sense used by cognitive psychologists. Is <i>thought</i> different from <i>attention</i>?  <br /><br />Once we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought#Etymology_and_usage" target="_blank">etymology and usage</a> of the word, no wonder we're so confused...<br /><br /><h4>Does Beauty Require Thought?</h4>Speaking of philosophy, a recent study tested <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-aesthetics/" target="_blank">Kant's views on aesthetics</a>, specifically the claim that experiencing beauty requires thought (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.018" target="_blank">Brielmann &amp; Pelli, 2017</a>).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gNOWoLSVVwQ/WVYdG-aVwcI/AAAAAAAAMNA/2uvwOKT5sx4qHphlGmvM-UmO7Z-f5Lj8wCLcBGAs/s1600/graphical%2Babstract_Beauty%2BRequires%2BThought.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="389" data-original-width="375" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gNOWoLSVVwQ/WVYdG-aVwcI/AAAAAAAAMNA/2uvwOKT5sx4qHphlGmvM-UmO7Z-f5Lj8wCLcBGAs/s320/graphical%2Babstract_Beauty%2BRequires%2BThought.png" width="308" /></a></div><br /><br />Participants in the study rated the pleasure they felt from seeing pictures (IKEA furniture vs. beautiful images), tasting Jolly Rancher candy, and touching a <a href="http://www.peruvianlink.com/product-p/16401.htm" target="_blank">soft alpaca teddy bear</a>. In one condition, they had to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory" target="_blank">working memory task</a> (an auditory 2-back task) at the same time.

So in this context, the authors effectively defined <i>thought</i> as <i>attention</i> or <i>working memory</i> (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.018" target="_blank">Brielmann &amp; Pelli, 2017</a>).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span><br /><br /><br /><b>Alternate Titles for the paper</b> (none of which sound as exciting as the original <i>Beauty Requires Thought</i>)<br /><br /><i>Aesthetic Judgments and Pleasure Ratings Require Attention</i><br /><br /><i>Judgments of Beauty Require Working Memory and Cognitive Control</i><br /><br />...or the especially clunky <i>Ratings of </i><i>“felt beauty</i><i>” Require Attention — but only for beautiful items</i>.<br /><br /><br />Dual task experiments are pretty popular.

<p>“After decades of debate, a consensus is emerging about the way self-esteem develops across the lifespan.” So wrote a pair of psychologists – one from Kings College London, the other from the University of California Davis – in <a href="http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/emot/robins_trz.selfesteemdevel_curidr2005.pdf">a paper</a> published back in 2005. That “consensus” is that self-esteem is relatively high in childhood, drops during adolescence, rises gradually through adulthood before dropping sharply in old age. But a new paper suggests that there’s a major blip in this pattern for one huge part of the population. Becoming a mother triggers a <i>decline</i> in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction over at least the next three years, according to research on nearly 85,000 mothers in Norway, <a href="https://osf.io/85uya/">forthcoming</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>.</p>
<p><span id="more-26041"></span></p>
<p>Wiebke Bleidorn of Tilburg University in the Netherlands and UC Davis led a team that assessed the mothers’ self-esteem and relationship satisfaction by asking them to complete questionnaires before, during and several times after giving birth, with the last completed when their child was 36 months old.</p>
<p>“Self-esteem decreased during pregnancy, increased until the child was six months old and then gradually decreased over following years,” they reported. The consistency of the data suggests that this is a “normative change pattern” – something that’s standard in a population.</p>
<p>The pattern they found is consistent with the idea that physical changes during pregnancy and in the immediate period afterwards may negatively impact mothers’ self esteem. The six-month upturn in self-esteem, meanwhile, maybe related to motherhood offering an opportunity to experience a sense of mastery and meaning. Beyond six months, the various biological, psychological and social shifts involved in coping with the task of caring for a baby might all begin to have an adverse impact on how a woman sees herself and others – especially her partner.</p>
<p>This last point might explain the findings on relationship satisfaction, which for first-time mothers was high during pregnancy, but sharply decreased around childbirth and then gradually decreased in the following years. There was a similar, though less drastic, pattern of change for women becoming a mother for a second, third or fourth time.</p>
<p>Relationship satisfaction and self-esteem also tended to correlate over time, which indicates that these two factors are linked – at least in the three years after a child is born, the team argued. They added that this makes intuitive sense: having a baby triggers a major change to responsibilities within the household (as well as a level of exhaustion that surely challenges any relationship …), and self-esteem theories emphasise the links between self-esteem and social acceptance and belonging.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked to see if other factors – such as whether the mother was cohabiting with the father, her employment status and her level of education – altered the trajectory of self-esteem and relationship satisfaction after childbirth. While there were some associations between these “covariate” factors and both self-esteem and relationship satisfaction, “most covariates did not strongly predict short-term or longer-term changes in maternal self-esteem and relationship satisfaction,” they noted.</p>
<p>The great strength of this study is the sheer number of mothers included, allowing for a fine-grained investigation of effects. But as the researchers themselves note, there are important limitations, including a lack of data before the 18th week of pregnancy, and beyond three years of giving birth, meaning it’s not clear how much longer the dent to self-esteem would have lasted.</p>
<p>That said, the new findings offer a clue that the apparent adverse effect of motherhood on self-esteem is relatively short-lived: some mothers participated in the study more than once, and when they returned during their second pregnancy, their average self-esteem was no lower than their baseline when they first participated, which suggests their self-esteem had recovered since having their first child (their relationship satisfaction, however, remained lower than it had been prior to their first child indicative of more lasting effects).</p>
<p>Even if a mother’s self-esteem does “only” drop over the three years after giving birth (the span of this study), this could have major consequences for the mother and perhaps the child, for example it may be a risk factor for post-natal depression. “Future research is needed to better understand individual differences in the direction and degree of change in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction,” the researchers concluded.</p>

Psychologists and social scientists tend to see their research as a force for good. But can we assume this? Couldn't knowledge of human behaviour be exploited for malicious ends?





As an example of what we might call the "goodness of psychology" assumption, consider this recent paper about Psychological Characteristics of Romance Scam Victims, from the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. The research is about online romance scams in which victims are convinced to s

<p><em>Funding led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from Union Square Ventures, Maverick Capital and Collaborative Fund</em></p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, CA – June 29, 2017</strong> <strong>–</strong> As further evidence of its position as the world’s leading platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;D), <a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com">Science Exchange</a> today announced it has raised $28 million in Series C funding. Founded in response to the global growth in outsourced R&amp;D services, the company has raised more than $58 million since its inception in 2011. Norwest Venture Partners led the latest round with participation from existing investors Union Square Ventures, Maverick Capital, and Collaborative Fund.</p>
<p>“In the last decade, outsourcing of R&amp;D has become a core strategy for improving efficiency and providing access to innovation for top companies globally. Forty percent of R&amp;D spend is now outsourced and this trend continues to grow,” explained Science Exchange CEO Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., a research scientist who co-founded the company. “At the same time, businesses are challenged to manage their outsourced R&amp;D. They need to track progress and provider performance across what could be hundreds of service provider relationships, impacting the cost, quality and timeliness of research projects. The Science Exchange platform solves this by removing barriers in the outsourcing process – providing companies with instant access to a network of pre-qualified service providers, as well as contracting, project management and reporting tools.”</p>
<p>As part of the Series C, <a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/casper-declercq/">Casper de Clercq</a>, General Partner at Norwest and veteran of the life sciences industry with more than 20 years of commercialization and operating experience, will join the company’s board.</p>
<p>“Science Exchange has developed an outsourcing platform that is enjoying tremendous momentum as many of the world’s largest pharma and biotech companies have signed up,” said Casper de Clercq, General Partner at Norwest. “They are well-positioned as the leader in a large and expanding market. We are excited to help Science Exchange become the world’s largest platform for outsourced R&amp;D.”</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be partnering with such prestigious investors to help us grow our business at such a critical time in the evolution of R&amp;D outsourcing,” commented Iorns. “This investor confidence confirms our business strategy and potential for continued growth.”</p>
<p>Through the Science Exchange platform, researchers have easy and secure access to more than 2,500 of the world’s premier outsourced R&amp;D service providers — qualified contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturers (CMOs), academic labs, and government facilities. Thousands of scientists have used the platform to support their pursuit of breakthrough scientific discoveries, including those from 10 of the top 20 biopharma companies. In fact, the company has grown its enterprise-wide strategic sourcing agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies by more than 2,000 percent since 2015.</p>
<p>Science Exchange plans to use the funding to continue its expansion beyond biopharma into other industries where scientists are faced with R&amp;D outsourcing challenges – including agricultural science, cosmetics, aerospace and industrial chemicals. The company will strategically hire across product, engineering, sales, marketing, and customer success.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/">Bradley Busch</a></p>
<p>Pressure does interesting things to an athlete. For some, it leads to an increase in tension, nerves and anxiety. Others are able to channel this increased pressure into running faster, jumping higher and throwing further. What strategies do these “big game players” use to raise their game under heightened pressure – known as a “clutch performance”?</p>
<p>In the <i>Journal of Sports Sciences</i>, researchers from Australia and England recently <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2016.1265661?journalCode=rjsp20">reported</a> the results of their interviews with sixteen athletes from around the world just a few days after they had delivered an excellent sporting performance in a competition when under pressure. The findings represent a step forward in our understanding of expert and skilled performances, showing how clutch performance is similar to, but distinct from, the related concept of “flow”.</p>
<p><span id="more-26063"></span></p>
<p>Christian Swann at the University of Wollongong, Australia, and his colleagues interviewed 16 athletes (5 women and 11 men, with an average age of 27) who came from a range of team and individual sports that included a Rugby World Cup Winner from New Zealand, a professional tennis player competing at Wimbledon, and an Olympic badminton player. The researchers asked the athletes to describe their recent outstanding performance in as much detail as possible, including what they were thinking and feeling at the time.</p>
<p>Analysis of the interviews revealed that there were twelve characteristics that underpinned a clutch performance. Six were similar to the state of flow, which is when performance feels effortless and skill set perfectly matches performance demands. These flow-like characteristics included: being fully absorbed in the task to the point that they were unaware of the crowd; high levels of confidence; a sense of control over their performance and the situation; enhanced motivation to succeed; enjoying it just enough (but not too much); and being fully alert. Some of the athletes even reported that time felt like it slowed down, and having a hazy memory of the event. These findings suggest that flow and clutch performances do overlap and are not completely distinct from one another.</p>
<p>However, six characteristics of the clutch state were distinct from flow. Whereas flow describes a gradual build-up of confidence and a feeling of effortlessness, other dimensions of clutch performances included: deliberate focus on the task at hand; having intense effort over a period of time (often characterised by not holding anything back); heightened self-awareness of what they were thinking and feeling at the time; high arousal levels; automaticity of skills; and the absence of negative thoughts about perceived consequences if they failed.</p>
<p>Previously, expert performance has been viewed as largely automatic and dependent on an athlete not overthinking. The new results suggest that although this may be one avenue to heightened performance, it is not the only one. The interviewed athletes recalled raising their game through high levels of self-monitoring and making a conscious effort to raise performance.</p>
<p>Many of the strategies underpinning clutch performance, such as deliberate focus, high arousal levels, and confidence, are malleable; that is to say that they can be taught, learnt and developed. Knowledge of these findings could be very useful for athletes, coaches and practitioners working with them. Central to this will be exploring when is the best time for athletes to relax and “let it happen”, and, conversely, when to consciously try harder “to make it happen”.</p>
<p>This study relied on athletes self-reporting their thoughts, feelings and strategies employed under pressure during a competition several days after the event. Although steps were taken within this study to improve accuracy, such as follow-up interviews, there are still obvious limitations with this approach including self-reporting biases and the limitations of memory.</p>
<p>Most people need to perform under pressure at some stage in their life, be it in public speaking, academic exams, or working closely to a deadline. How much can these new findings be applied to these settings? The researchers urge a bit of caution, as this is still somewhat unknown. They stress that for now it is “important to avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach to expert performance. There may be some underlying principles that can be transferred, but knowing which ones will probably rely on knowledge of both the task at hand and the person who has to execute the skill. The mysteries of performance excellence under pressure in non-sporting domain promises to be an exciting area for psychologists to continue to research over the coming years.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/06/28/best-and-worst-in-health-and-healthcare-may-2017/">Best and Worst in Health and Healthcare – May 2017</a></h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In May, next generation therapies took the spotlight: brain-computer interfaces, brain training, tDCS, DNA vaccines, probiotics… Yet, they weren’t all successful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s the best and worst news of May.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The best</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Brain–computer interface therapy for post-stroke motor rehabilitation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Functional recovery from motor disabilities can be a major challenge following stroke. A <a href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/05/26/STROKEAHA.116.016304">new study</a> tested a new therapy for motor-related disabilities affecting the arm in hemiparetic stroke survivors. It consisted of an exoskeleton driven by a <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/24/brain-machine-interfaces-new-technology-in-the-making/">brain–computer interface</a> (BCI) that used neural activity from the unaffected brain hemisphere to control the movement of the affected hand. By using BCI control to associate imagined hand movements with the opening and closing of the affected hand, participants would train the uninjured parts of their brain to take over movements that were previously controlled by the injured areas of the brain. This BCI-based therapy was shown to be effective in improving motor performance. Another important aspect of this study was the fact that this method was designed and configured for home-based neurorehabilitation. Its efficacy therefore showed that BCI-driven neurorehabilitation can be effectively delivered in the home environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A probiotic for IBS-associated depression</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 11% of the world’s population and is commonly accompanied by psychiatric symptoms, namely depression and anxiety. The <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/18/the-brain-gut-axis-part-1-a-paradigm-shift-in-neuroscience/">gut microbiota</a> is increasingly acknowledged as a key player in IBS and, via the gut-brain axis, as a likely contributor to the development of the associated psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(17)35557-9/abstract">new study</a> aimed at evaluating the effects of a probiotic bacteria on anxiety and depression in patients with IBS. The probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001 (BL) was administered to 44 adults with IBS and anxiety and/or depression for 6 weeks. It was shown that patients who received the probiotic were more likely to have a reduction in depression scores (but not anxiety) and increased quality of life than patients in the placebo group. BL had no effect on IBS, indicating that the reduction in depression scores was not merely a consequence of a reduction in IBS symptoms. Through fMRI analysis, these effects were shown to be linked to changes in brain activation patterns reflecting an effect of the probiotic on the limbic system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Brain training for chronic TBI</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brain training has shown beneficial effects in acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) therapy, but studies on its effects in chronic TBI are still lacking. Therefore, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434192/">new study</a> aimed at determining how the injured brain responds to cognitive training months-to-years after injury. Subjects with chronic TBI received <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/01/25/boost-confidence-with-brain-training/">cognitive training</a> for 8 weeks. Cortical thickness and brain connectivity were assessed as indicators of brain plasticity before training, immediately after training, and 3 months after training.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Results showed that cortical thickness and brain connectivity were improved after strategy-based reasoning training, which focused on selective attention, abstract reasoning, and other cognitive strategies. Importantly, these improvements were evident even 3 months after training was completed, indicating a sustained effect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>DNA vaccines for Alzheimer’s disease</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DNA vaccines may be the next generation of vaccines. They are designed to induce the production of antigens through the action of genetically engineered DNA, thereby triggering a protective immunological response. Although they are not yet approved for human use, they have been showing interesting beneficial effects in pre-clinical research. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405538/">new study</a> has tested a DNA A?42 trimer vaccine (targeting amyloid plaques) for its effect on experimental <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was shown that DNA A?42 immunization produced a high antibody response and that the antibodies generated after vaccination were able to detect amyloid plaques in the brain, suggesting a promising preventive effect for Alzheimer’s disease. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Cannabinoids for age-related cognitive decline</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The activity of the endocannabinoid system declines during aging, with the expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the levels of the major endocannabinoid (2-AG) being reduced in the brain of older animals. In a letter published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4311">Nature Medicine</a></em>, new data shows that a prolonged exposure to low doses of the cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive substance in cannabis) can reverse the age-related <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/29/running-from-aging-fitness-and-brain-health/">cognitive decline</a> in mice, improving spatial memory, long-term memory and learning flexibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The effect was accompanied by an increase in synaptic density in the hippocampus and a restoration of hippocampal gene transcription to patterns similar to those of young animals. This indicates a potential beneficial effect of cannabinoids in treating age-related cognitive impairments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The worst</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sleep disturbances may increase the risk of dementia</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sleep disturbances are known to contribute to an overall deterioration of health. An association between <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/16/can-a-sleepwalker-feel-pain/">sleep disorders</a> and the development of dementia has also been proposed. A <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/4/329.long">new study</a> aimed at determining if this association is indeed observable in population-based studies. A first phase of the study took place between 1984 and 1989, when data about the sleeping patterns of the participants was collected. The incidence of dementia in those participants was now assessed using data from health registries. It was found that the risk ratio for dementia was significantly higher in individuals with frequent sleep disturbances.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Maternal stress and fetal development</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortin (UCN) are two proteins with important roles in both human stress regulation and pregnancy. Therefore, a <a href="http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10253890.2017.1312336">new study</a> investigated the association between an acute stress response, social overload (as an indicator of chronic stress) and the levels of CRH and UCN in the amniotic fluid of healthy, second-trimester pregnant women. The analyzes revealed that an acute <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/24/9-personality-traits-putting-mothers-at-risk-of-postpartum-depression/">maternal stress</a> response was not associated with increased levels of the two peptides, but that maternal chronic social overload and amniotic CRH were positively correlated. Amniotic CRH was found to be able to influence fetal growth albeit in a non-linear way. This indicates that, although acute maternal stress may not be as influential, chronic maternal stress may affect the production of molecules, such as CRH, that can potentially influence fetal development. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>tDCS does not improve the effect of cognitive training</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested be able to enhance cognitive abilities when associated with cognitive training. This claim has been tested in a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139">new study</a> of 123 older adults, in whom the effects of 20 sessions of anodal tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex and simultaneous working memory training on cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/">tDCS</a> failed to improve the efficacy of cognitive training. A meta-analysis including younger and older individuals was also performed. It also indicated that tDCS is not effective at improving the effect of cognitive training in working memory and global cognition. It is possible that the inefficacy of tDCS may be due to an inadequacy of current tDCS protocols for enhancing the effects of cognitive training, indicating that those protocols may need to be optimized.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cues associated with the consumption of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/05/diabetes-drug-for-addiction-treatment/">cocaine</a> can lead to dopamine release in the striatum brain region. This response is believed to be associated with the the motivation to consume. The acquisition of drug-seeking behaviors is believed to be associated with conditioned dopamine responses in the ventral striatum. But as drug use continues and becomes a habit, the conditioned responses shift to the dorsal striatum, which may be associated with compulsive drug use and susceptibility to addiction. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405406/">new study </a>used PET imaging and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>personalized cocaine cues to assess the pattern of the dopamine response in in recreational cocaine users without a substance use disorder. The results showed that the exposure to cues associated with the opportunity to use the drug increased the dopamine response in the dorsal striatum in recreational cocaine users. This indicates that a susceptibility to addiction may be developing even though there are no psychiatric signs of a substance abuse disorder. </span></p>

A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/23/E4676.abstract">new study</a> has reveled that NRF2 activation was suppressed in neural stem cells of Huntington’s disease patients, suggesting that these cells may be abnormally susceptible to oxidative stress. On the bright side, it was shown that the pharmacological activation of NRF2 was able to decrease inflammatory responses in glial cells, the main cellular mediators of neuroinflammation, and in blood monocytes from Huntington’s disease patients. These findings also suggest that NRF2 may be an important therapeutic target in Huntington’s disease.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-collage-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the boreal forest of Fennoscandia over 150,000 moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) are harvested annually. Gut piles left in the field by hunters provide a large pulse of energy into the ecosystem, a potentially important food source for a range of scavenging predators.</p>
<p>Increased populations of these predators can negatively affect threatened or important game species. As a response to this, restrictions on field dressing of moose are under consideration in parts of Norway.</p>
<p>In this study, we used camera-trap data from 50 gut piles during 1043 monitoring days. Our research show that many species utilize gut piles, highlighting the potential importance of gut piles as a food source in the boreal ecosystem. Corvids (such as crows and ravens), medium-sized mammals, and raptors (such as golden eagles) were important scavengers in our study area, with corvids and the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) the main scavengers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9216" style="width: 682px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9216" height="504" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-fig-1.jpg" width="672" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Red foxes might be attracted by corvid activity during daytime. Here with five magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and one hooded crow (<em>Corvus cornix</em>).</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Corvids arrived first at the gut piles and could benefit from access to gut pile parts with the highest energy content. Corvid presence decreased with gut pile age, and we suggest that rather than feeding on parts with low energy content, corvids search for new gut piles when the energy rich parts are consumed, .</p>
<p>Being quite abundant, corvids might limit mammal access to high energy content, as mammals in general arrive later at the gut piles. Hence, temporal and spatial variation in corvid density in the boreal ecosystem might affect the gut pile biomass available to mammals.</p>
<p>Mammals scavenged on all parts of the gut piles, resulting in close to total consumption of the gut piles. The probability of mammal presence decreased at high gut pile densities. We suggest that this is due to a saturation effect – mammals can’t keep up with the input of fresh gut piles.</p>
<p>During summer, surplus gut piles would probably be lost resources to mammals as gut piles would be consumed by insects, bacteria and fungi. Low temperatures prevent this during autumn, keeping surplus gut piles available for scavengers after the hunting season ends.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9214" style="width: 648px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9214" height="385" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gormo-figure-2.gif" width="638" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Temporal development of the availability of gut pile parts with high and low energy content. Years are pooled</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Gomo et al. 2017</div></figure>
<p>The hunting season ends in mid-November. Gut pile parts with low energy content accumulates during the hunting season, and are available in relatively high densities a month after the end of the hunting season.</p>
<p>We know little about how gut piles affect individual survival or population dynamics of scavenging species. However, many studies have shown positive effects from food subsidies on consumer species, and it is reasonable to assume that removing this large pulse of energy from the boreal forests of Fennoscandia would have a negative impact on some of the species scavenging on gut piles.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to predict the long-term effect on the relative abundance of scavengers. Removing gut piles could potentially reduce less wanted species of corvids and red fox, but also impact less abundant species like raptors. Reducing the amount of gut piles in the landscape would on the other hand reduce the potential risk of lead poisoning from bullet fragments, an increasing concern in raptor conservation. However, to what extend this pulsed resource is important for the overall survival, reproduction and population dynamics of both scavenging and potential prey species needs further investigation.</p>

<p>Most of us remember kids at school who seemed a little different – less sociable, more introverted and fragile, perhaps – and that they often seemed to be the ones to get picked on or rejected. Maybe you remember because you were one of those kids and you know what is was like to not fit in. Personality psychologists who study these things have partly backed this up: they’ve found that children and teens who score low in the “Big Five” traits of emotional stability, conscientiousness and agreeableness (similar to friendliness) are more likely to be bullied.</p>
<p>But of course being different is relative, it depends a lot on the crowd you’re in. A new <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2105/full">study</a> in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em> has looked into this, providing a more nuanced picture of how a teenager’s personality may place them at risk of being bullied. The results suggest that teenagers are more likely to be a victim of bullying if they have a personality that is unusual compared with what’s typical in their particular classroom. The researchers, led by Savannah Boele at Tilburg University, say their findings need to be extended and replicated, but they hope they could help teachers spot and support the kids in their class who are most likely to be bullied.</p>
<p><span id="more-25897"></span></p>
<p>The data come from over a thousand pupils from six secondary schools in The Netherlands. Just under half were boys and the average age of the sample was 13.5 years.  All the participants completed measures of their Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional instability, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness) and their “Dark Triad” traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism). The participants also stated who from their class had bullied them, if anyone, and who, if anyone, they had bullied. The kind of bullying – verbal or physical and so on, was not specified.</p>
<p>To measure classroom personality, the researchers identified the average rank order of the eight different personality traits across pupils for each class. For instance, the class might score highest on extraversion, on average, followed by agreeableness, then conscientiousness and so on. Each participant’s own personality profile, in terms of the rank order of their own traits, could then be compared with their class average.</p>
<p>The more different a participant’s personality profile was from their classroom’s average, the more likely they were to be named as victims of bullying by their peers (there was a trend for them to also be more likely to describe themselves as victims, but this didn’t reach statistical significance). The researchers said this result is in-line with “previous findings that youths who deviate from social norms are more likely to be rejected and perceived as low-status peers and hence at increased risk for being victimised by their peers”.</p>
<p>Boele’s team also looked at participants’ specific personality traits and how these related to the class average. Discrepancies here were mostly related to describing oneself as a bullying victim, rather than being named as a victim. Specifically, having higher or lower extraversion, agreeableness or openness to experience than the classroom average was correlated with describing oneself as a victim of bullying. So too was having higher than average emotional instability or Machiavellianism, and lower than average psychopathy. In terms of being named as a victim, having higher than average emotional instability was a correlate, as was having higher or lower Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>The findings are preliminary and there are some obvious gaps – actual acts of bullying were not recorded, but depended on participants’ own sense of victimisation or admissions of bullying others. This means, for example, that having a different level of extraversion than what’s typical for the class might be related to extra sensitivity towards potential slights, rather than to overt acts of bullying (given that scoring differently from the class average on extraversion, and some other traits, was related to self-identifying as a victim, but not being named as a victim). Another thing: how a teenager’s personality is perceived by their peers is also likely to be highly relevant but wasn’t measured in this study, which relied entirely on participants’ descriptions of their own personalities. Finally, remember the data are correlational, so it’s possible being bullied affects teens’ personalities, rather than, or as well as, their personalities affecting their risk of being bullied.</p>
<p>So more research needed, but this paper makes an important contribution to the literature, being the first study to provide evidence that having a personality that’s different from the classroom average can be a risk factor for being bullied.</p>

<p>
 Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity occurs almost exclusively in ice-free areas that cover less than 1% of the continent. Climate change will alter the extent and configuration of ice-free areas, yet the distribution and severity of these effects remain unclear. Here we quantify the impact of twenty-first century climate change on ice-free areas under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate forcing scenarios using temperature-index melt modelling. Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over 17,000 km2 by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/tEdrQvmj2AQ/nature22993">Tracing the origins of relapse in acute myeloid leukaemia to stem cells</a></h4>

<p>
 In acute myeloid leukaemia, long-term survival is poor as most patients relapse despite achieving remission. Historically, the failure of therapy has been thought to be due to mutations that produce drug resistance, possibly arising as a consequence of the mutagenic properties of chemotherapy drugs. However, other lines of evidence have pointed to the pre-existence of drug-resistant cells. For example, deep sequencing of paired diagnosis and relapse acute myeloid leukaemia samples has provided direct evidence that relapse in some cases is generated from minor genetic subclones present at diagnosis that survive chemotherapy, suggesting that resistant cells are generated by evolutionary processes before treatment and are selected by therapy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of therapy failure and capacity for leukaemic regeneration remain obscure, as sequence analysis alone does not provide insight into the cell types that are fated to drive relapse. Although leukaemia stem cells have been linked to relapse owing to their dormancy and self-renewal properties, and leukaemia stem cell gene expression signatures are highly predictive of therapy failure, experimental studies have been primarily correlative and a role for leukaemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia relapse has not been directly proved. Here, through combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identify therapy-resistant cells already present at diagnosis and two major patterns of relapse. In some cases, relapse originated from rare leukaemia stem cells with a haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell phenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from larger subclones of immunophenotypically committed leukaemia cells that retained strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, the shared functional and transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of relapse emphasize the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that target stemness to prevent relapse.

<p>
 Genomic analysis of tumours has led to the identification of hundreds of cancer genes on the basis of the presence of mutations in protein-coding regions. By contrast, much less is known about cancer-causing mutations in non-coding regions. Here we perform deep sequencing in 360 primary breast cancers and develop computational methods to identify significantly mutated promoters. Clear signals are found in the promoters of three genes. FOXA1, a known driver of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, harbours a mutational hotspot in its promoter leading to overexpression through increased E2F binding. RMRP and NEAT1, two non-coding RNA genes, carry mutations that affect protein binding to their promoters and alter expression levels. Our study shows that promoter regions harbour recurrent mutations in cancer with functional consequences and that the mutations occur at similar frequencies as in coding regions. Power analyses indicate that more such regions remain to be discovered through deep sequencing of adequately sized cohorts of patients.

<p>
 In contrast to the DNA-based viruses in prokaryotes, the emergence of eukaryotes provided the necessary compartmentalization and membranous environment for RNA viruses to flourish, creating the need for an RNA-targeting antiviral system. Present day eukaryotes employ at least two main defence strategies that emerged as a result of this viral shift, namely antiviral RNA interference and the interferon system. Here we demonstrate that Drosha and related RNase III ribonucleases from all three domains of life also elicit a unique RNA-targeting antiviral activity. Systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment of this class of proteins illustrates the recognition of unbranched RNA stem loops. Biochemical analyses reveal that, in this context, Drosha functions as an antiviral clamp, conferring steric hindrance on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses. We present evidence for cytoplasmic translocation of RNase III nucleases in response to virus in diverse eukaryotes including plants, arthropods, fish, and mammals. These data implicate RNase III recognition of viral RNA as an antiviral defence that is independent of, and possibly predates, other known eukaryotic antiviral systems.

<p>
 Cutaneous melanoma is a type of cancer with an inherent potential for lymph node colonization, which is generally preceded by neolymphangiogenesis. However, sentinel lymph node removal does not necessarily extend the overall survival of patients with melanoma. Moreover, lymphatic vessels collapse and become dysfunctional as melanomas progress. Therefore, it is unclear whether (and how) lymphangiogenesis contributes to visceral metastasis. Soluble and vesicle-associated proteins secreted by tumours and/or their stroma have been proposed to condition pre-metastatic sites in patients with melanoma. Still, the identities and prognostic value of lymphangiogenic mediators remain unclear. Moreover, our understanding of lymphangiogenesis (in melanomas and other tumour types) is limited by the paucity of mouse models for live imaging of distal pre-metastatic niches. Injectable lymphatic tracers have been developed, but their limited diffusion precludes whole-body imaging at visceral sites. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is an attractive ‘lymphoreporter’ because its expression is strongly downregulated in normal adult lymphatic endothelial cells, but is activated in pathological situations such as inflammation and cancer. Here, we exploit this inducibility of VEGFR3 to engineer mouse melanoma models for whole-body imaging of metastasis generated by human cells, clinical biopsies or endogenously deregulated oncogenic pathways. This strategy revealed early induction of distal pre-metastatic niches uncoupled from lymphangiogenesis at primary lesions. Analyses of the melanoma secretome and validation in clinical specimens showed that the heparin-binding factor midkine is a systemic inducer of neo-lymphangiogenesis that defines patient prognosis. This role of midkine was linked to a paracrine activation of the mTOR pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells. These data support the use of VEGFR3 reporter mice as a ‘MetAlert’ discovery platform for drivers and inhibitors of metastasis.

<p>
 Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n = 13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n = 3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n = 10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn’s disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/2EqUpDINqTk/nature22964">mTORC1-dependent AMD1 regulation sustains polyamine metabolism in prostate cancer</a></h4>

<p>
 Activation of the PTEN–PI3K–mTORC1 pathway consolidates metabolic programs that sustain cancer cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates polyamine dynamics, a metabolic route that is essential for oncogenicity. By using integrative metabolomics in a mouse model and human biopsies of prostate cancer, we identify alterations in tumours affecting the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) and polyamine synthesis. Mechanistically, this metabolic rewiring stems from mTORC1-dependent regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) stability. This novel molecular regulation is validated in mouse and human cancer specimens. AMD1 is upregulated in human prostate cancer with activated mTORC1. Conversely, samples from a clinical trial with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus exhibit a predominant decrease in AMD1 immunoreactivity that is associated with a decrease in proliferation, in line with the requirement of dcSAM production for oncogenicity. These findings provide fundamental information about the complex regulatory landscape controlled by mTORC1 to integrate and translate growth signals into an oncogenic metabolic program.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/MqmQWwmdYis/">The brain basis of “hatred of sound:” Misophonia</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/06/5499502593_84981c67d2_z-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>“Munch, munch, munch.”</em></p>
<p>For most of us, the sounds of our lunch date chewing or a coworker clicking their pen are everyday components of an auditory landscape that go largely unnoticed. But for others, these seemingly mundane sounds are painfully unpleasant to the point of eliciting uncontrollable irritation or rage. There is ongoing disagreement as to whether this <em>hatred of sound</em>, termed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508801" target="_blank">misophonia</a>, should be recognized as a legitimate psychiatric disorder, and many sufferers continue to shamefully hide their extreme emotional responses to common sounds. But a recent surge in interest in misophonia is encouraging many to acknowledge that they suffer from the condition, and some medical professionals to accept that this reaction to otherwise neutral auditory stimuli reflects a veritable disorder. A flurry of research, aimed to characterize its behavioral manifestations and outline diagnostic criteria, has appeared over the past decade, though few studies have sought to determine the neural underpinnings of misophonia.</p>
<p><strong>Characterizing the “hatred of sound”</strong></p>
<p>Since “misophonia” was <a href="http://w.tinnitus.org/DST_NL2_PJMJ.pdf" target="_blank">first coined</a> in the early 2000’s, efforts have been made to characterize its symptoms through patient interview. Although its prevalence remains uncertain due to its still relative obscurity, studies suggest that it typically strikes in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706" target="_blank">adolescence</a>, affects men and women equally, and may occur in much as 20% of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752915" target="_blank">population</a>. The most commonly reported trigger sounds include eating, breathing or repetitive behaviors like typing or pen clicking. Hearing such sounds often evokes uncontrollable irritation, disgust or anger, which the individual recognizes as socially inappropriate. Therefore, the misophonic may try to suppress any outward reaction, with few acting upon their urges with verbal or physical aggression. These aversive responses in fact manifest as measurable physiological arousal. Compared to healthy controls, misophonic individuals have <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00296" target="_blank">excessive skin conductance responses</a> to auditory stimuli, and the magnitude of these skin responses correlates with how distressing the participants perceive the sounds.</p>
<p><strong>An undiagnosed disorder?</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of misophonia largely overlap with other clinically accepted psychiatric disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and various phobias. Some individuals reporting misophonic symptoms also have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondria, OCD, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431300" target="_blank">eating disorders</a>. Although some <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706" target="_blank">experts advise</a> that misophonia be identified as a unique psychiatric disorder, it has yet to be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Miren Edelstein, a graduate student at the University of California San Diego who researches misophonia, explains that</p>
<blockquote><p>“The uncertainty surrounding the official status of misophonia as a discrete disorder stems from the fact that it does indeed have some similarities with other existing conditions. However, while some misophonics definitely do suffer from some of these other existing conditions, many do not and report no other ailments whatsoever. Because of this variation, I don’t believe another existing disorder can completely account for the specific constellation of symptoms present in misophonia.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The misophonic brain</strong></p>
<p>Despite an advancing understanding of the psychological and behavioral manifestations of misophonia, little research has attempted to clarify its neurobiological bases. Researchers suspect that misophonia is not a primary auditory disorder, but rather stems from aberrant attentional or emotional processing later in the brain’s auditory system. There is preliminary support for this explanation from one small <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00123" target="_blank">EEG study</a>. In an oddball auditory paradigm, misophonic participants showed a smaller N1 evoked potential than controls elicited by unexpected auditory tones, whereas the “pre-attentive” P1 component showed no group difference. The N1 is involved in early attention and detecting sensory changes, suggesting that abnormal attentional signaling early in the auditory processing stream may contribute to misophonia. Interestingly, an altered N1 peak has also been associated with impulsivity, drug abuse and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321671/" target="_blank">researchers used fMRI</a> to examine brain activity in misophonic individuals while they listened to sounds that were neutral, unpleasant or characteristic misophonia triggers. The misophonics rated the trigger sounds as more distressing than the unpleasant or neutral sounds, whereas normal controls rated trigger and unpleasant sounds as similarly annoying, confirming a selective intolerance for triggers by misophonics. Critically, the misophonics showed greater activation in the insula than controls during trigger sounds, and this activity increased with greater reported distress. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the insula and other brain regions involved in attention and emotion was altered in misophonics when listening to trigger sounds. Although the insula has been promiscuously implicated in a plethora of cognitive processes, its proposed functions include internal awareness of one’s body and emotional states. Though preliminary, these findings suggest that misophonia is associated with pathological activation of a brain network supporting interception. Edelstein, who was not involved in this study, comments “There was a huge gap in the literature until recently. I think this study was a triumphant effort towards gleaning neurophysiological insights on misophonia and its findings fit nicely into the narrative emerging from behavioral research on misophonia.”</p>
<p>It has also been proposed that altered brain connectivity underlying misophonia may be similar to that occurring in synesthesia, a condition in which one sensory stimulus evokes sensation in a different modality (e.g., the letter “A” is associated with the color red). Faulty enhanced neural connections could theoretically lead to abnormal associations amongst sensory and emotional brain regions in misophonia, although this hypothesis remains untested.</p>
<p><strong>Pacifying sound distress</strong></p>
<p>Given the novelty of misophonia, effective therapies have been inadequately assessed. However, there is some support for the use of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032716321681" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> and <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0034-1372527" target="_blank">conditioning retraining</a>. Hopefully, with further research into both its psychological profile and neurobiological underpinnings, misophonia will gain both greater social acceptance and effective treatment options.</p>
