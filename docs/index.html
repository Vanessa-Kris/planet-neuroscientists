              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">How Mars rovers have evolved in 25 years of exploring the Red Planet</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Few things are harder than hurling a robot into space — and sticking the landing. On the morning of July 4, 1997, mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., were hoping to beat the odds and land a spacecraft successfully on the Red Planet.</p>



<p>Twenty-five years ago that little robot, a six-wheeled rover named Sojourner, made it — becoming the first in a string of rovers built and operated by NASA to explore Mars. Four more NASA rovers, each more capable and complex than the last, have surveyed the Red Planet. The one named Curiosity marked its 10th year of cruising around on August 5. Another, named Perseverance, is busy collecting rocks that future robots are supposed to retrieve and bring back to Earth. China recently got into the Mars exploring game, landing its own rover, Zhurong, last year.</p>





<p>Other Mars spacecraft have done amazing science from a standstill, such as the twin Viking landers in the 1970s that were the first to photograph the Martian surface up close and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes">InSight probe that has been listening for Marsquakes shaking the planet’s innards</a> (<em>SN Online: 2/24/20</em>). But the ability to rove turns a robot into an interplanetary field geologist, able to explore the landscape and piece together clues to its history. Mobility, says Kirsten Siebach, a planetary scientist at Rice University in Houston, “makes it a journey of discovery.”</p>

<h4>Red planet ramblings</h4>



<p>Five U.S. rovers and one Chinese rover have reached Mars, all visiting different locations on the planet. Many focused on areas that may have once been wet and favorable for potential life.</p>

<p>Each of the Mars rovers has gone to a different place on the planet, enabling scientists to build a broad understanding of how Mars evolved over time. The rovers revealed that Mars contained water, and other life-friendly conditions, for much of its history. That work set the stage for Perseverance’s ongoing hunt for signs of ancient life on Mars.</p>

<h4>Off-road trips</h4>



<p>The ruggedness of the rovers is a big factor in how far they travel and how long they operate. Three of the machines are still exploring.</p>

<p>Each rover is also a reflection of the humans who designed and built and drove it. Perseverance carries on one of its wheels a symbol of Mars rover tracks twisted into the double helix shape of DNA. That’s “to remind us, whatever this rover is, it’s of human origin,” says Jennifer Trosper, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Lab, or JPL, who has worked on all five NASA rovers. “It is us on Mars, and kind of our creation.”</p>

<p><strong>SIZE: </strong>Microwave oven</p>



<p><strong>FUN FACTS: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Had to stay close to its lander to communicate with Earth </li><li>Analyzed 15 Martian rocks</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>The little microwave that could</h4>



<p>Sojourner, that first rover, was born in an era when engineers weren’t sure if they even could get a robot to work on Mars. In the early 1990s, then-NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin was pushing the agency to do things “faster, better and cheaper” — a catchphrase that engineers would mock by saying only two of those three things were possible at the same time. NASA had no experience with inter­planetary rovers. Only the Soviet Union had operated rovers — on the moon in 1970 and 1973.</p>



<p>JPL began developing a Mars rover anyway. Named after the abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the basic machine was the size of a microwave oven. Engineers were limited in where they could send it; they needed a large flat region on Mars because handling a precision landing near mountains or canyons was beyond their abilities. NASA chose Ares Vallis, a broad outflow channel from an ancient flood, and the mission landed there successfully.</p>



<p>Sojourner spent nearly three months poking around the landscape. It was slow going. Mission controllers had to communicate with Sojourner constantly, telling it where to roll and then assessing whether it had gotten there safely. They made mistakes: One time they uploaded a sequence of computer commands that mistakenly told the rover to shut itself down. They recovered from that stumble and many others, learning to quickly fix problems and move forward.</p>

<p>Although Sojourner was a test mission to show that a rover could work, it managed to do some science with its one X-ray spectrometer. The little machine analyzed the chemical makeup of 15 Martian rocks and tested the friction of the Martian soil.</p>



<p>After surviving 11 weeks beyond its planned one-week lifetime, Sojourner ultimately grew too cold to operate. Trosper was in mission control when the rover died on September 27, 1997. “You build these things, and even if they’re well beyond their lifetime, you just can’t let go very easily, because they’re part of you,” she says.</p>

<p><strong>FUN FACTS: </strong></p>

<h4>Twin explorers</h4>



<p>In 1998 and 1999, NASA hurled a pair of spacecraft at Mars; one was supposed to orbit the planet and another was supposed to land near one of the poles. Both failed. Stung from the disappointment, NASA decided to build a rover plus a backup for its next attempt.</p>



<p>Thus were born the twins Spirit and Opportunity. Each the size of a golf cart, they were a major step up from Sojourner. Each had a robotic arm, a crucial development in rover evolution that enabled the machines to do increasingly sophisticated science. The two had beefed-up cameras, three spectrometers and a tool that could grind into rocks to reveal the texture beneath the surface.</p>



<p>But there were a lot of bugs to work out. Spirit and Opportunity launched several weeks apart in 2003. Spirit got to Mars first, and on its 18th Martian day on the surface it froze up and started sending error messages. It took mission controllers days to sort out the problem — an overloaded flash-memory system — all while Opportunity was barreling toward Mars. Ultimately, engineers fixed the problem, and Opportunity landed safely on the opposite side of the planet from Spirit.</p>



<p>Both rovers lasted years beyond their expected three-month lifetimes. And both did far more Martian science than anticipated.</p>



<p>Spirit broke one of its wheels early on and had to drive backward, dragging the broken wheel behind it. But the rover found plenty to do near its landing site of Gusev crater, home to a classic Mars landscape of dust, rock and hills. Spirit found rocks that appeared to have been altered by water long ago and later spotted a pair of iron-rich meteorites. The rover ultimately perished in 2010, stuck in a sand-filled pit. Mission controllers tried to extract it in an effort dubbed “Free Spirit,” but salts had precipitated around the sand grains, making them particularly slippery.</p>



<p>Opportunity, in contrast, became the Energizer Bunny of rovers, exploring constantly and refusing to die. Immediately after landing in Meridiani Planum, Opportunity had scientists abuzz.</p>

<p>“The images that the rover first sent back were just so different from any other images we’d seen of the Martian surface,” says Abigail Fraeman, a planetary scientist at JPL. “Instead of these really dusty volcanic plains, there was just this dark sand and this really bright bedrock. And that was just so captivating and inspiring.”</p>



<p>Right at its landing site, Opportunity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/signs-water-flow-oceans-data-point-ancient-martian-sea">spotted the first definitive evidence of past liquid water on Mars</a>, a much-anticipated and huge discovery (<em>SN: 3/27/04, p. 195</em>). The rover went on to find evidence of liquid water at different times in the Martian past. After years of driving, the rover reached a crater called Endeavour and “stepped into a totally new world,” Fraeman says. The rocks at Endeavour were hundreds of millions of years older than others studied on Mars. They contained evidence of different types of ancient water chemistry.</p>



<p>Opportunity ultimately drove farther than any rover on any extraterrestrial world, breaking a Soviet rover’s lunar record. In 2015, Opportunity passed 26.2 miles (42.2 km) on its odometer; mission controllers celebrated by putting a marathon medal onto a mock-up of the rover and driving it through a finish line ribbon at JPL. Opportunity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-dead">finally died in 2019</a> after an intense dust storm obscured the sun, cutting off solar power, a must-have for the rover to recharge its batteries (<em>SN: 3/16/19, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>The twin rovers were a huge advance over Sojourner. But the next rover was an entirely different beast.</p>

<p><strong>SIZE: </strong>SUV</p>



<p><strong>FUN FACTS: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Needed a sky crane with rockets to hover above ground and slowly lower the behemoth to the surface</li><li>Found evidence of an ancient lake, sniffed methane gas, measured radiation levels</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>The SUV of rovers</h4>



<p>By the mid-2000s, NASA had decided it needed to go big on Mars, with a megarover the size of a sports utility vehicle. The one-ton Curiosity was so heavy that its engineers had to come up with an entirely new way to land on Mars. The “sky crane” system used retro-rockets to hover above the Martian surface and slowly lower the rover to the ground.</p>



<p>Against all odds, in August 2012, Curiosity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wheels-down-mars-rover-takes-view">landed safely near Mount Sharp</a>, a 5-kilometer-high pile of sediment within the 154-kilometer-wide Gale crater (<em>SN: 8/25/12, p. 5</em>). Unlike the first three Mars rovers, which were solar-powered, Curiosity runs on energy produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium. That allows the rover to travel farther and faster, and to power a suite of sophisticated science instruments, including two chemical laboratories.</p>



<p>Curiosity introduced a new way of exploring Mars. When the rover arrives in a new area, it looks around with its cameras, then zaps interesting rocks with its laser to identify which ones are worth a closer look. Once up close, the rover stretches out its robotic arm and does science, including drilling into rocks to see what they are made of.</p>



<p>When Curiosity arrived near the base of Mount Sharp, it immediately spotted rounded pebbles shaped by a once-flowing river, the first close­up look at an ancient river on Mars. Then mission controllers sent the rover rolling away from the mountain, toward an area in the crater known as Yellowknife Bay. There Curiosity discovered evidence of an ancient lake that created life-friendly conditions for potentially many thousands of years.</p>



<p>Curiosity then headed back toward the foothills of Mount Sharp. Along the way, the rover discovered a range of organic molecules in many different rocks, hinting at environments that had been habitable for millions to tens of millions of years. It sniffed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/curiosity-finds-mars-methane-changes-seasons">methane gas sporadically wafting within Gale crater</a>, a still-unexplained mystery that could result from geologic reactions, though methane on Earth can be formed by living organisms (<em>SN: 7/7/18, p. 8</em>). The rover measured radiation levels across the surface — helpful for future astronauts who’ll need to gauge their exposure — and observed dust devils, clouds and eclipses in the Martian atmosphere and night sky.</p>

<p>“We’ve encountered so many unexpectedly rich things,” says Ashwin Vasavada of JPL, the mission’s project scientist. “I’m just glad a place like this existed.”</p>



<p>Ten years into its mission, Curiosity still trundles on, making new discoveries as it climbs the foothills of Mount Sharp. It recently departed a clay-rich environment and is now entering one that is heavier in sulfates, a transition that may reflect a major shift in the Martian climate billions of years ago.</p>



<p>In the course of driving more than 28 kilometers, Curiosity has weathered major glitches, including one that shuttered its drilling system for over a year. And its wheels have been banged up more than earthbound tests had predicted. The rover will continue to roll until some unknown failure kills it or its plutonium power wanes, perhaps five years from now.</p>

<p><strong>FUN FACTS: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Collecting rocks for later recovery mission</li><li>Traveled almost five kilometers in 30 Martian days</li><li>Helicopter Ingenuity was expected to fly five times, but it has made 29 trips so far</li></ul>

<h4>A rover and its sidekick</h4>



<p>NASA’s first four rovers set the stage for the most capable and agile rover ever to visit Mars: Perseverance. Trosper likens the evolution of the machines to the growth of children. “We have a preschooler in Sojourner, and then &#8230; your happy-go-lucky teenagers in Spirit and Opportunity,” she says. “Curiosity is certainly a young adult that’s able to do a lot of things on her own, and Perseverance is kind of that high-powered mid­career [person] able to do pretty much anything you ask with really no questions.”</p>



<p>Perseverance is basically a copy of Curiosity built from its spare parts, but with one major modification: a system for drilling, collecting and storing slender cores of rock. Perseverance’s job is to collect samples of Martian rock for future missions to bring to Earth, in what would be the first robotic sample return from Mars. That would allow scientists to do sophisticated analyses of Martian rocks in their earthbound labs. “It feels, even more than previous missions, that we are doing this for the next generation,” Siebach says.</p>



<p>The rover is working fast. Compared with Curiosity’s leisurely exploration of Gale crater, Perseverance has been zooming around its landing site, the 45-kilometer-wide Jezero crater, since its February 2021 arrival. It has collected 10 rock cores and is already eyeing where to put them down on the surface for future missions to pick up. “We’re going to bring samples back from a diversity of locations,” says mission project scientist Kenneth Farley of Caltech. “And so we keep to a schedule.”</p>



<p>Perseverance went to Jezero to study an ancient river delta, which contains layers of sediment that may harbor evidence of ancient Martian life. But the rover slightly missed its target, landing on the other side of a set of impassable sand dunes. So it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">spent most of its first year exploring the crater floor</a>, which turned out to be made of igneous rocks (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 32</em>). The rocks had cooled from molten magma and were not the sedimentary rocks that many had expected.</p>



<p>Scientists back on Earth will be able to precisely date the age of the igneous rocks, based on the radioactive decay of chemical elements within them, providing the first direct evidence for the age of rocks from a particular place on Mars.</p>

<p>Once it finished exploring the crater floor in March, the rover drove quickly toward the delta. Each successive NASA rover has had greater skills in autonomous driving, able to identify hazards, steer around them and keep going without needing constant instructions from mission control.</p>



<p>Perseverance has a separate computer processor to run calculations for autonomous navigation, allowing it to move faster than Curiosity. (It took Curiosity two and a half years to travel 10 kilometers; Perseverance traveled that far in a little over a year.) “The rover drives pretty much every minute that we can give it,” Farley says.</p>



<p>In April, Perseverance set a Martian driving record, traveling nearly five kilometers in just 30 Martian days. If all goes well, it will make some trips up and down the delta, then travel to Jezero crater’s rim and out onto the ancient plains beyond.</p>



<p>Perseverance has a sidekick, Ingenuity, the first helicopter to visit another world. The nimble flier, only half a meter tall, succeeded beyond its designers’ wildest dreams. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">helicopter made 29 flights in its first 16 months</a> when it was only supposed to make five in one month. It has scouted paths ahead and scientific targets for the rover (<em>SN Online: 4/19/22</em>). Future rovers are almost certain to carry a little buddy like this.</p>

<p><strong>FUN FACTS</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>Dormant now during Martian winter, but is set to reawaken in December</li><li>Found signs of recent water activity in a&nbsp; geologically young setting</li><li>Found Martian soil similar to some of Earth’s desert sands</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>China’s debut</h4>



<p>While the United States has led in Mars rover exploration, it is not the only player on the scene. In May 2021, China became the second nation to successfully place a rover on Mars. Its Zhurong rover, named after a mythological fire god, has been exploring part of a large basin in the planet’s northern hemisphere known as Utopia Planitia.</p>



<p>The landing site lies near a geologic boundary that may be an ancient Martian shoreline. Compared with the other Mars rover locations, Zhurong’s landing site is billions of years younger, “so we are investigating a different world on Mars,” says Lu Pan, a planetary scientist at the University of Copenhagen who has collaborated with Zhurong scientists.</p>



<p>In many ways, Zhurong resembles Spirit and Opportunity, in size as well as mobility. It carries cameras, a laser spectrometer for studying rocks and ground-penetrating radar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">probe underground soil structures</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>After landing, Zhurong snapped pictures of its rock-strewn surroundings and headed south to explore a variety of geologic terrains, including mysterious cones that could be mud volcanoes and ridges that look like windblown dunes. The rover’s initial findings include that the Martian soil at Utopia Planitia is similar to some desert sands on Earth and that water had been present there perhaps as recently as 700 million years ago.</p>



<p>In May, mission controllers switched Zhurong into dormant mode for the Martian winter and hope it wakes up at the end of the season, in December. It has already traveled nearly two kilometers across the surface, farther than the meager 100 meters that Sojourner managed. (To be fair, Sojourner had to keep circling its lander because it relied on that lander to communicate with Earth.)</p>

<p>From Sojourner to Zhurong, the Mars rovers show what humankind can accomplish on another planet. Future rovers might include the European Space Agency’s ExoMars, although its 2022 launch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">was postponed after Russia attacked Ukraine</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 6</em>). Europe terminated all research collaborations with Russia after the invasion, including launching ExoMars on a Russian rocket.</p>



<p>Vasavada remembers his sense of awe at the Curiosity launch in 2011: “Standing there in Florida, watching this rocket blasting off and feeling it in your chest and knowing that there’s this incredibly fragile complex machine hurtling on the end of this rocket.… It just gave me this full impression that here we are, humans, blasting these things off into space,” he says. “We’re little tiny human beings sending these things to another planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/windchime-experiment-dark-matter-wind-gravity-physics">The Windchime experiment could use gravity to hunt for dark matter ‘wind’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret to directly detecting dark matter might be blowin’ in the wind.</p>



<p>The mysterious substance continues to elude scientists even though it outweighs visible matter in the universe by about 8 to 1. All laboratory attempts to directly detect dark matter — seen only indirectly by the effect its gravity has on the motions of stars and galaxies — have gone unfulfilled.</p>



<p>Those attempts have relied on the hope that dark matter has at least <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">some other interaction</a> with ordinary matter in addition to gravity (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>). But a proposed experiment called Windchime, though decades from being realized, will try something new: It will search for dark matter using the only force it is guaranteed to feel — gravity.</p>





<p>“The core idea is extremely simple,” says theoretical physicist Daniel Carney, who described the scheme in May at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics in Orlando, Fla. Like a wind chime on a porch rattling in a breeze, the Windchime detector would <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP22/Session/2A.8">try to sense a dark matter “wind</a>” blowing past Earth as the solar system whips around the galaxy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If the Milky Way is mostly a cloud of dark matter, as astronomical measurements suggest, then we should be sailing through it at about 200 kilometers per second. This creates a dark matter wind, for the same reason you feel a wind when you stick your hand out the window of a moving car.</p>



<p>The Windchime detector is based on the notion that a collection of pendulums will swing in a breeze. In the case of backyard wind chimes, it might be metal rods or dangling bells that jingle in moving air. For the dark matter detector, the pendulums are arrays of minute, ultrasensitive detectors that will be jostled by the gravitational forces they feel from passing bits of dark matter. Instead of air molecules bouncing off metal chimes, the gravitational attraction of the particles that make up the dark matter wind would cause distinctive ripples as it blows through a billion or so sensors in a box measuring about a meter per side.</p>

<p>While it may seem logical to search for dark matter using gravity, no one has tried it in the nearly 40 years that scientists have been pursuing dark matter in the lab. That’s because gravity is, comparatively, a very weak force and difficult to isolate in experiments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re looking for dark matter to [cause] a gravitational signal in the sensor,” says Carney, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. “And you just ask . . . could I possibly see this gravitational signal? When you first make the estimate, the answer is no. It’s actually going to be infeasibly difficult.”</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t stop Carney and a small group of colleagues from <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.072003">exploring the idea anyway in 2020</a>. “Thirty years ago, this would have been totally nuts to propose,” he says. “It’s still kind of nuts, but it&#8217;s like borderline insanity.”</p>



<p>The Windchime Project collaboration has since grown to include 20 physicists. They have a prototype Windchime built of commercial accelerometers and are using it to develop the software and analysis that will lead to the final version of the detector, but it’s a far cry from the ultimate design. Carney estimates that it could take another few decades to develop sensors good enough to measure gravity even from heavy dark matter.</p>



<p>Carney bases the timeline on the development of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Interferometer</a>, or LIGO, which was designed to look for gravitational ripples coming from black holes colliding (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). When LIGO was first conceived, he says, it was clear that the technology would need to be improved by a hundred million times. Decades of development resulted in an observatory that views the sky in gravitational waves. With Windchime, “we’re in the exact same boat,” he says.</p>



<p>Even in its final form, Windchime will be sensitive only to dark matter bits that are roughly the mass of a fine speck of dust. That’s enormous on the spectrum of known particles — more than a million trillion times the mass of a proton.</p>



<p>“There is a variety of very interesting dark matter candidates at [that scale] that are definitely worth looking for … including primordial black holes from the early universe,” says Katherine Freese, a physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who is not part of the Windchime collaboration. Black holes slowly evaporate, leaking mass back into space, she notes, which could leave many relics formed shortly after the Big Bang at the mass Windchime could detect.</p>



<p>But if it never detects anything at all, the experiment still stands out from other dark matter detection schemes, says Dan Hooper, a physicist at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., also not affiliated with the project. That’s because it would be the first experiment that could entirely rule out some types of dark matter.</p>



<p>Even if the experiment turns up nothing, Hooper says, “the amazing thing about [Windchime] … is that, independent of anything else you know about dark matter particles, they aren’t in this mass range.” With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">existing experiments</a>, a failure to detect anything could instead be due to flawed guesses about the forces that affect dark matter (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Windchime will be the only experiment yet imagined where seeing nothing would definitively tell researchers what dark matter isn’t. With a little luck, though, it could uncover a wind of tiny black holes, or even more exotic dark matter bits, blowing past as we careen around the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dead-wolf-spiders-robots-necrobots">Scientists turned dead spiders into robots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have literally reanimated dead spiders to do their bidding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new field dubbed “necrobotics,” researchers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202201174">converted the corpses</a> of wolf spiders into grippers that can manipulate objects. All the team had to do was stab a syringe into a dead spider’s back and superglue it in place. Pushing fluid in and out of the cadaver made its legs clench open and shut, the researchers report July 25 in <em>Advanced Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea was born from a simple question, explains Faye Yap, a mechanical engineer at Rice University in Houston. Why do spiders curl up when they die?</p>





<p>The answer: Spiders are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">hydraulic machines</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>). They control how much their legs extend by forcing blood into them. A dead spider no longer has that blood pressure, so its legs curl up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were just thinking that was so cool,” Yap says. “We wanted to leverage it.”</p>



<p>Her team first tried putting dead wolf spiders in a double boiler, hoping that the wet heat would make the spiders expand and push their legs outward. That didn’t work. But when the researchers injected fluid straight into a spider corpse, they found that they could control its grip well enough to pull wires from a circuit board and pick up other dead spiders. Only after hundreds of uses did the necrobots start to become dehydrated and show signs of wear.</p>

Yap and coauthors</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the future, the researchers will coat spiders with a sealant to hold off that decline. But the next big step is to control the spiders’ legs individually, Yap says, and in the process, figure out more about how spiders work. Then her team could translate their understanding into better designs for other robots.</p>



<p>“That would be very, very interesting,” says Rashid Bashir, a bioengineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who wasn’t involved in the new study. A spider corpse itself would probably have problems as a robot, he says, because it won’t perform consistently like “hard robots” and its body will break down over time. But spiders can definitely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-can-be-coaxed-making-toughest-kind-spider-silk">offer lessons</a> to engineers (<em>SN: 4/2/19</em>). “There’s a lot to be learned from biology and nature,” Bashir says.</p>



<p>Despite the whole reanimating dead spiders thing, Yap is no mad scientist. She wonders whether it’s okay to play Frankenstein, even with spiders. “No one really talks about the ethics” when it comes to this sort of research, she says.</p>



<p>Scientists need to figure out the morality of this sort of bioengineering before they get too good at it, Bashir agrees. The question is, he says, “how far do you go?” </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-monoclonal-antibody-immune-proteins">A shot of immune proteins may protect against malaria for months</a></h4>

              
                <p>A single shot that could provide months-long protection against malaria has proven effective and safe in a small, early clinical trial of adults.</p>



<p>The shot, which contains monoclonal antibodies, would primarily be intended for infants and children in countries with the most malaria transmission, the team who conducted the trial says. These young children have the highest risk of dying from severe malaria. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the clinical trial, 15 of 17 participants <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2203067">who received the monoclonal antibodies did not become infected</a> after being exposed to mosquitoes with malaria in the lab, the researchers report in the Aug. 4 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. All six people who did not receive the medicine developed infections.</p>





<p>The clinical trial tested different doses and delivered the medicine intravenously or as a shot. Based on a computer model of how the medicine is taken up, distributed and then cleared by the body, the researchers estimate that one shot may protect against malaria for six months.</p>



<p>“What we’ve always been looking for is some sort of intervention that will prevent infection reliably and for as long a time as possible,” says Miriam Laufer, a pediatric infectious disease doctor and director of the Malaria Research Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.</p>



<p>Ideally, Laufer says, that would be a highly effective vaccine that provides years and years of protection. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">new malaria vaccine</a> has recently become available, but it is only modestly protective against the disease, and that protection wanes rapidly (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>). The vaccine requires four shots.</p>



<p>Monoclonal antibodies could provide an option that requires only one shot, once a year. It will take more research to see how well the antibodies work against malaria outside of the laboratory and how cost-effective the shot is.</p>



<p>The monoclonal antibodies shot wouldn’t exclude the need for other prevention strategies, says Laufer, who was not involved in the new study. But it could be “one of the easier interventions in terms of minimal contact with the health care system, with good benefit.”</p>



<p>What’s appealing, she says, “is the possibility that you could give kids, even the youngest kids, an injection [of] premade antibodies that could last for six months or longer and protect them throughout the rainy season.” That once-a-season shot would be helpful in countries in West Africa, where malaria transmission only occurs during the rainy season.</p>



<p>Malaria sickened an estimated 241 million people and killed 627,000 worldwide in 2020. Most of those deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in children younger than 5. These littlest kids haven’t had the chance to develop immunity to the disease and are more susceptible to dying if severe malaria develops.</p>



<p>Reducing the spread of malaria includes measures to control mosquitoes, such as using insecticide-treated nets over beds or spraying to kill mosquitoes indoors, as well as preventing infections, such as taking antimalarial drugs at regular intervals. In October 2021, the World Health Organization also recommended the new vaccine, which in clinical trials reduced cases of malaria and severe malaria by 36 percent after four years of follow-up.</p>



<p>Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made version of antibodies, the proteins that the immune system produces in response to a vaccine or natural infection. Monoclonal means that it contains clones, or copies, of one particular antibody.</p>



<p>The antibody evaluated in the clinical trial attaches to a protein on the surface of sporozoites — the form of the malaria parasite that enters the body after an infected mosquito bites — and stops the parasites from infecting the liver.</p>



<p>The new monoclonal antibody has improvements over an earlier version developed by the same research team. The new version binds more strongly to the targeted malaria parasite protein. It also has a tweak that keeps it from degrading too quickly in the body. This boosts its half-life in the blood (the time it takes for half of the medicine to degrade) to 56 days, almost three times that of its predecessor.</p>



<p>Two clinical trials are planned to assess how well the medicine protects children in places where malaria is spreading. One trial in Mali, where malaria transmission is seasonal, will study the shot’s efficacy over seven months. Another trial in Kenya, among the countries in East Africa where malaria spreads year-round, will assess how well the shot works while following the children for a year. Those studies will also help to determine the best dose for children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/safeguarding-peer-review-in-the-era-of-evolving-paper-mills/">Safeguarding peer review in the era of evolving paper mills</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>Trust is at the heart of the peer review system &ndash; trust that authors conduct and report research with integrity, trust that editors and reviewers provide an objective, rigorous, and fair assessment when evaluating manuscripts, and trust that publishers maintain sufficient checks and balances to uphold high scientific and ethical standards and provide researchers equitable opportunities to publish their work.</p>



<p>Within this system, publishers work with the research community to provide a body of published work that has been vetted by peers and to which scientists and the general public can look for reliable information pushing the envelope of knowledge.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, trust is sometimes broken. This week, <em>PLOS ONE</em> retracted 20 articles as part of a large publication ethics case involving more than a hundred published articles. The evidence in this case suggests that a limited cohort of individuals may have taken steps to manipulate &ndash; or influence the outcome of &ndash; the publication process while serving as authors, reviewers, or Academic Editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Importantly, not every author, editor, or reviewer who contributed to the retracted articles was directly implicated in the concerns.</strong> This may be a case wherein upstanding researchers unknowingly became involved with a problematic service or collaborator(s) when preparing their manuscripts for publication.</p>



<p>Cross-publisher information sharing about specific cases and tactics can be invaluable in informing and expediting our collective efforts to safeguard peer review and ensure the reliability of the published research corpus. This post openly discusses aspects of this case in order to provide additional context for the retractions, contribute to the broader cross-publisher discussion, and raise awareness among researchers as to &lsquo;services&rsquo; that should be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>PLOS ONE&rsquo;s current case</em></strong></p>



<p><em>The information below does not include all of the concerns that contributed to the retraction decisions: we must hold some information as confidential due to the nature of the concerns and because we need to protect the efficacy of our integrity checks.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 20 retractions <em>PLOS ONE</em> posted on August 3 are the first resolutions in a larger case for which most affected articles identified thus far report agricultural research. As is stated in the published retraction notices, the concerns pertain to competing interests, authorship, and peer review integrity. We identified both article-level and series-level concerns, although not every editorial concern applies to every article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case opened due to concerns about an author submitting an unusually high number of submissions in a short period. Thereafter, PLOS staff editors identified the larger series on the basis of shared authors and Academic Editors. Although the majority of authors appear only once within the series, a fraction of authors and Academic Editors appear repeatedly throughout the series. PubMed and Google Scholar searches revealed that several of these individuals have published at very high volumes (e.g. &gt;100 articles) over the past two years, exceeding what would be expected even for very active researchers.</p>



<p>One major issue that emerged in our investigation involved competing interests in peer review. For many articles, we found that the handling Academic Editor had recently co-published work with one or more author(s). According to the PLOS Competing Interests policy, Academic Editors should recuse themselves from reviewing the submissions in such cases. Unfortunately, this evaded <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s internal competing interest checks which are not currently equipped to identify co-publication histories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding to the author/editor competing interest concerns, most Academic Editors involved in the case joined the <em>PLOS ONE </em>Editorial Board during the period when we were receiving these submissions, were requested by the corresponding authors, and have co-published &ndash; in some cases, extensively &ndash; with other Academic Editors and/or authors who appear repeatedly across the series of affected articles. We also identified other peer review integrity concerns which we cannot discuss publicly.</p>



<p>Whether the issues in this case arose due to honest errors (e.g. misunderstanding of PLOS policies) or intentional systematic manipulation of the publication process, the editorial outcome is the same: we concluded that peer review was compromised and that there were editorial policy compliance issues, necessitating retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Avoiding bias in peer review by external Editorial Boards</em></strong></p>



<p>PLOS is following up with the Academic Editors flagged in this <em>PLOS ONE</em> case. Looking more broadly, this case provides an example of a mechanism by which peer review involving external editorial boards can be exploited, whether by paper mills, organized networks, or individuals. We are applying our learnings from this case to inform outreach efforts and system-wide updates that can help us to mitigate this risk and help us identify similar cases prior to publication in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, while we take the threat to peer review very seriously, the concerns in this case involved only a very miniscule fraction of the <em>PLOS ONE</em> Editorial Board. We do not have reason to question the integrity of the many due to concerning behavior by a limited few.</p>



<p><em>PLOS ONE&rsquo;s</em> Academic Editors play a pivotal role in the publication process: they are responsible for inviting reviewers and issuing editorial decisions on submitted articles. PLOS is incredibly grateful for the service and support of our Editorial Board members, and we have a dedicated team who carefully vets Academic Editor applications, provides training during the onboarding process, and supports Academic Editors throughout their tenure with PLOS. Additionally, journal staff support Academic Editors as needed for individual manuscripts and monitor for adherence to the journal&rsquo;s peer review standards, publication criteria, and policies.</p>



<p>Returning to the issue of trust, PLOS relies on the integrity of our Academic Editors and authors in abiding by our editorial policies and<a href="https://plos.org/resources/editor-center/conduct/"> Code of Conduct</a> for Editorial Board members. We regularly receive indications that this trust is well-placed: we often receive inquiries and editors&rsquo; recusals pertaining to potential competing interests, and we have a strong history of relationships with and peer review by our valued Editorial Board members. That said, we also receive occasional questions about competing interests. In the wake of this case we are taking steps to increase our authors&rsquo; and Academic Editors&rsquo; understanding of our Competing Interests policy and how it should be applied during peer review.</p>



<p>We are also looking to enhance the stringency of our internal checks. <em>PLOS ONE&rsquo;s</em> routine competing interest checks are currently limited; to apply a check based on co-publication histories at the scale of <em>PLOS ONE</em>, we would need an automated tool in place, ideally one that is integrated into our submission system. We are looking toward new tools that can help enhance and broaden our competing interests checks, as well as other mechanisms&nbsp; &ndash; e.g. workflow updates, audits, data-driven investigations of unusual activity &ndash; by which we can improve our detection of peer review integrity issues.</p>



<p><strong><em>Closing remarks &ndash; a cross-publisher perspective</em></strong></p>



<p>Systematic manipulation of the publication process appears to be on the rise, and the tactics used by bad actors continuously evolve. This presents an ever-present challenge to publishers seeking to detect such issues and ensure (or restore) the integrity of the published record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whereas several large-scale cases discussed previously centered on <em>content</em> issues &ndash; e.g. paper mill* cases involving duplicated images, text overlap, or other erroneous or problematic content &ndash; it appears that paper mills and other author service enterprises are now inserting themselves into peer review. This <em>PLOS ONE</em> case has highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer review system that may apply across the industry to journals who rely upon external editorial boards.</p>



<p>In addition to addressing issues internally, we need collaborative cross-industry initiatives and advances to help us &ndash; as a collective industry &ndash; combat systematic publication manipulation more effectively and efficiently. Some such projects led by STM and COPE are now underway, and we look forward to continued progress in this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>*Paper mills are fee-for-service organizations that provide customers means of securing publications. These organizations (which may be formal companies, individuals, or networks of individuals) may, for example, sell fabricated manuscripts or data, authorship on articles reporting research to which the customer did not contribute, or writing and/or submission services to expedite publication of the customer&rsquo;s own research by offering a guaranteed peer review outcome.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-cartwheel-galaxy-image">A new James Webb telescope image reveals a galactic collision’s aftermath</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s not easy being ringed. A newly released image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, shows the Cartwheel Galaxy <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-039">still reeling from a run-in with a smaller galaxy</a> 400 million years ago.</p>



<p>The Cartwheel Galaxy, so called because of its bright inner ring and colorful outer ring, lies about 500 million light-years from Earth. Astronomers think it used to be a large spiral like the Milky Way, until a smaller galaxy smashed through it. In earlier observations with other telescopes, the space between the rings appeared shrouded in dust.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">JWST’s infrared cameras</a> have peered through the dust and found previously unseen stars and structure (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). The new image shows sites of intense star formation throughout the galaxy that were triggered by the collision’s aftereffects. Some of those new stars are forming in spokelike patterns between the central ring and the outer ring, a process that is not well understood.</p>

<p>Ring galaxies are rare, and galaxies with two rings are even more unusual. That strange shape means that the long-ago collision set up multiple waves of gas rippling back and forth in the galaxy left behind. It’s like if you drop a pebble in the bathtub, says JWST project scientist Klaus Pontoppidan of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “First you get this ring, then it hits the walls of your bathtub and reflects back, and you get a more complicated structure.”</p>



<p>The effect probably means that the Cartwheel Galaxy has a long road to recovery ahead — and astronomers don’t know what it will look like in the end.</p>



<p>As for the smaller galaxy that caused all this mayhem, it didn’t stick around to get its picture taken. “It’s gone off on its merry way,” Pontoppidan says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/organ-donation-pig-death-artificial-system-restored-cell-life">An hour after pigs’ deaths, an artificial system restored cellular life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Call it cellular life support for dead pigs. A complex web of pumps, sensors and artificial fluid can move oxygen, nutrients and drugs into pigs’ bodies, preserving cells in organs that would otherwise deteriorate after the heart stops pumping.</p>



<p>The finding, described August 3 in <em>Nature</em>, is preliminary, but it hints at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05016-1">new ways to keep organs in a body healthy</a> until they can be used for transplantation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In earlier work, scientists built a machine they named BrainEx, which kept aspects of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dead-pig-brains-bathed-artificial-fluid-showed-signs-cellular-life">cellular life chugging along</a> in decapitated, oxygen-deprived pig brains (<em>SN</em><em>: 4/17/19</em>). The new system, called OrganEx, pushes the approach to organs beyond the brain.</p>





<p>“We wanted to see if we could replicate our findings in other damaged organs across the body, and potentially open the door for future transplantation studies,” says Nenad Sestan, a neuroscientist at Yale University School of Medicine.<br><br>OrganEx aims to do the job of hearts and lungs by pumping an artificial fluid throughout pig bodies. Mixed in a 1–1 ratio with the animals’ own blood, the lab-made fluid has ingredients that provide fresh oxygen and nutrients, prevent clots and protect against inflammation and cell death.</p>



<p>Anesthetized pigs were put into cardiac arrest and then left alone for an hour. Then some pigs were placed on an existing medical system, called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO. This adds oxygen to the pigs’ own blood and pumps it into their body. Other pigs received the OrganEx treatment.</p>



<p>Compared with ECMO, OrganEx provided more fluid to tissues and organs, the researchers found. Fewer cells died, and some tissues, including kidneys, even showed cellular signs of repairing themselves from the damage done after the heart stopped.</p>



<p>A similar system might one day be useful for protecting human organs destined to be donated. But for now, “there is still lots of work to be done in our animal model,” Sestan says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">Spinal stimulation gives some people with paralysis more freedom</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">By his count, Michel Roccati is on his third life, at least. In the first, he was a fit young man riding his motorcycle around Italy. A 2017 crash in the hills near Turin turned him into the second man, one with a severe spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Today, the third Michel Roccati works out in his home gym in Turin, gets around with a walker and climbs stairs to visit a friend in a second-story apartment. Today, he says, his life is “completely different than it was before.”</p>



<p>Roccati, age 31, is one of three men who received experimental spinal cord stimulators as part of a clinical trial. All three had completely paralyzed lower bodies. The results have been a stunning success, just as Roccati had hoped. “I fixed in my mind how I was at the end of the project,” he says. “I saw myself in a standing position and walking. At the end, it was exactly what I expected.”</p>





<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01663-5#citeas">technology that Roccati and others use</a>, described in the February <em>Nature Medicine</em>, is an implanted array of electrodes that sits next to the spinal cord below the spot severed by the injury. Electrical signals from the device replace the missing signals from the brain, prompting muscles to move in ways that allow stepping, climbing stairs and even throwing down squats in the gym.</p>



<p>Today, Roccati spends time working at the consulting company he owns with his brother and sharing his ongoing physical accomplishments with researchers. “Every week we get a WhatsApp from Michel doing something new,” says study coauthor Robin Demesmaeker, a neural engineer at NeuroRestore, a research and treatment center in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>These results and others prove that, with the right technology, people with severe spinal cord injury may be able to stand up and walk again. It’s a remarkable development.</p>



<p>But the really big news in this area goes far beyond walking. Many people with spinal cord injuries deal with problems that aren’t as obvious as paralysis. Low blood pressure, sexual dysfunction and trouble breathing or controlling hands, arms, bladder and bowels can all be huge challenges for people with paralysis as they navigate their daily lives. “These are the things that actually matter to people with spinal cord injuries,” says John Chernesky, who has a spinal cord injury. He works at the nonprofit Praxis Spinal Cord Institute in Vancouver, where he makes sure the priorities and voices of people living with spinal cord injuries are heard and addressed in research.</p>



<p>By figuring out the language of the spinal cord, researchers hope to learn how to precisely fill in the missing commands, bridging the gap left by the injury. The work may pave the way to treat many of these problems flagged by patients as important.</p>



<p>“The research field is changing … embracing all these other aspects,” says neuroscientist Kim Anderson Erisman of MetroHealth Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Already, early clinical trials are tackling the less obvious troubles that come with spinal cord injuries. Some of the same scientists that helped Roccati recently showed that similar spinal cord stimulation eased a man’s chronic low blood pressure. Other researchers are improving bladder and bowel function with stimulation. Still more work is focused on hand movements. The technology, and the understanding of how to use it to influence the nerves in the spinal cord, is moving quickly.</p>



<p>Not coincidentally, the way the research is being conducted is shifting, too, says Anderson Erisman, who has a spinal cord injury. “Scientists know the textbook things about spinal cord injuries,” she says. “But that’s not the same thing as living one day in the life with a spinal cord injury.” Involving people with such injuries in studies — as true partners and collaborators, not just subjects — is pushing research further and faster. Such collaboration, she says, “will only make your program stronger.”</p>



<p>These efforts are in the early stages. The stimulators are not available to the vast majority of people who might benefit from them. Only a handful of people have participated in these intense clinical trials so far. It’s unclear how well the results will hold up in larger trials with a greater diversity of volunteers. Also unclear is how attainable the technology will be for people who need it. For now, the research often requires large teams of experts, typically in big cities, with patients needing surgery and months of training the body to respond.</p>



<p>Still, the promise of spinal cord stimulation extends beyond spinal cord injuries. Stimulating nerves on the spinal cord could help people with symptoms from strokes, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and other disorders in which signals between the brain and body get garbled. Initially, “hardly anyone wanted to believe these [improvements] were happening,” says V. Reggie Edgerton, an integrative biologist at the University of Southern California’s Neurorestoration Center and the Rancho Los Amigos Rehabilitation Center in Downey, Calif. “But now, they’re happening so regularly that it’s undeniable.”</p>



<h4>A turnaround</h4>



<p>Not so long ago, a serious spinal cord injury was a death sentence. “Prior to World War II, the life expectancy of a person with a spinal cord injury was measured in days or weeks,” Chernesky says. If the injury didn’t kill a person directly, they’d often succumb to respiratory distress or blood poisoning from a bladder infection. “If you lived six months, that was impressive,” he says.</p>



<p>The spinal cord ferries signals between brain and body. Signals from the brain tell leg muscles to contract for a step, blood vessels to expand and the bladder to hold steady until a bathroom is within reach. Signals from the body to the brain carry sensations of moving, pain and touch. When the spinal cord is injured, as it is for an estimated 18,000 or so people each year in the United States alone, these signals are blocked.</p>

<h3>Lost signals&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In the United States, an estimated 18,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury each year. Vehicle crashes and falls are the most common causes, data collected from 2015 to 2021 show. Violence, particularly gunshot wounds, and sports accidents are also common reasons. </p>

</div>



<p>Researchers have long dreamed of repairing the damage by bridging the gap, perhaps with stem cells or growth factors that can beckon nerve cells to grow across the scar. The idea of using electricity to stimulate nerves below the site of the injury came, in part, from an accidental observation. In the mid-1970s, scientists were testing spinal cord stimulation as a treatment for severe and chronic pain. One participant happened to be a woman who was paralyzed from multiple sclerosis, a disease in which the body attacks its own nerves. With the device implanted on her spinal cord to ease pain, she was able to move again. That surprising discovery helped spark interest in spinal cord stimulation as a way to restore movement.</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers at the University of Louisville in Kentucky <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(11)60547-3/fulltext">restored the ability to stand to a 23-year-old man</a> with paraplegia. In 2018, that group and two others reported even greater strides in spinal stimulation: People with severe spinal cord injuries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-paralysis-top-science-stories-2018-yir">could step and walk with assistance</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 30</em>).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Demesmaeker and his colleagues, including Grégoire Courtine of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, published the achievements of Roccati and two other men. All three men had been unable to move their lower limbs or feel any sensations there.</p>



<p>Most previous studies had relied on an electrode array designed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat chronic pain. That device has electrodes that are implanted along the spinal cord, where their electrical jolts can ease long-term pain in the back and legs. But Roccati and the two other men received a specially designed device that was slightly longer and wider than that earlier device, able to cover more of the spinal cord’s nerve roots and provide more stimulation options.</p>



<p>Several weeks after surgery, the men visited the laboratory in Lausanne to start searching for the optimal stimulation settings. The timing, pattern and strength of the electrode signals were adjusted to allow Roccati to move. “We found a good sequence with the engineers that allowed me to stand up and see my body standing in the mirror in front of me,” Roccati says. “It was a very emotional moment. A standing ovation appeared from everyone in there.”</p>



<p>That first day, he took steps with the stimulation while being supported by a harness. That quick improvement is important, says biomedical engineer Ismael Seáñez of Washington University in St. Louis. “From day one, you can start training.” After months of intense practice (four to five sessions a week for one to three hours at a time), Roccati could walk without the harness, using only a walker.</p>



<p>The men in the trial have all been getting stronger, even when the stimulation is off. That suggests that there’s some sort of repair happening in the body, perhaps due to stronger neural pathways in the spinal cord. Just how the stimulation repairs the spinal cord is one of the big remaining mysteries.</p>



<p>“It’s exciting to see,” Seáñez says. “But it’s a first step in all of the different challenges faced by people with spinal cord injuries.”</p>

<h4>Signaling blood vessels</h4>



<p>One important problem with paralysis is low blood pressure. When the spinal cord is damaged, the signals that keep blood vessels constricted and blood pressure normal can get lost. Low blood pressure can leave people mentally foggy, exhausted and prone to fainting, not ideal conditions for physical rehab work. Blood pressure can also rise or fall quickly, upping the risk for stroke and heart attack. That’s a huge problem, says Aaron Phillips, who studies the physiology of the nervous system at the University of Calgary in Canada. “Blood pressure is one of the vital signs of life,” he says.</p>



<p>So Phillips, Courtine and colleagues decided to implant a spinal cord stimulator to see if it would help a man who had low blood pressure due to a spinal cord injury. When the machine was on, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03180-w">his blood pressure rose toward normal levels</a>, the researchers reported last year in <em>Nature</em>. When the stimulation was turned off, the man’s blood pressure dropped.</p>



<p>The scientists homed in on an area in the mid-back, just around thoracic segment 11 in the human spine. That spot had the biggest effect on the man’s blood pressure. “We now know that there’s a key area in the spinal cord that, when stimulated, controls neural circuits and the connected blood vessels to elevate and decrease blood pressure,” Phillips says.</p>



<p>The system the researchers developed operated like a thermostat with a set point. In experiments with the man on a tilting table, monitors sensed low blood pressure when the table mimicked standing up. That triggered the stimulators, which in turn told the blood vessels to bring the pressure back up to an acceptable level.</p>



<p>The results represent “a huge pinnacle of my career,” Phillips says. But many challenges remain. The system used in the study in <em>Nature</em> needs tweaking, and the long-term effects of such stimulation aren’t known. Phillips and his colleagues hope to answer these questions. With funding from DARPA, a U.S. Department of Defense agency that invests in breakthrough technologies, the team is working on a wireless blood pressure monitor, and an upcoming clinical trial aims to enroll about 20 people with spinal cord injuries that affect their blood pressure.</p>



<h4>Patient priorities</h4>



<p>In 2004, Anderson Erisman and her colleagues asked people with spinal cord injuries to share their priorities for regaining function. For people with quadriplegia, who have impairments from the neck down, hand and arm function were most important. For people with paraplegia, who have use of their arms and upper body, sexual function was the highest priority. Both groups emphasized <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15672628/">the desire for restored bladder and bowel function</a>, Anderson Erisman and colleagues reported in the <em>Journal of Neurotrauma</em>. Walking was not at the top of either group’s wish list.</p>



<p>That’s no surprise to Chernesky, who uses a wheelchair. “The general population looks at people with spinal cord injuries rolling around in wheelchairs, and they say, ‘Oh, poor bugger. I bet he wishes he could walk,’ ” he says. “They have no idea that quite rapidly after an injury, walking becomes a lower priority.”</p>



<p>Chernesky himself recently participated in a clinical trial designed to externally stimulate the cervical spine, in his neck, to improve arm and hand movements. The device he tested sent signals to the spinal cord through the skin — a less invasive approach than surgery, but one that may sacrifice some specificity compared with implanted versions. Throughout that process, Chernesky noticed improvements in energy, sleep, strength, core stability and movement of both upper and lower limbs.</p>

<p>Other scientists are working on similar ways to externally stimulate the spinal cord to improve people’s autonomic nervous system. That system keeps your blood pressure steady, makes you sweat when it’s hot and tells you when you need to head to a bathroom.</p>



<p>In studies at the University of Southern California and elsewhere, Edgerton and colleagues have recently shown that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35250456/">external stimulation improved bowel function</a>. He and others have also seen <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32116576/">stimulators improve bladder function</a> in people with spinal cord injuries and strokes. “We know some subjects can now feel when their bladder is full,” says Edgerton, who started a company called SpineX in 2019 to develop the technology further. That newfound sensation gives people enough time to get to the bathroom. “This doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen in every individual,” he cautions. “But it happens a lot.”</p>



<h4>Getting past the hype</h4>



<p>The next phase of research will be boring — in the best possible way. Large, standardized studies will need to address some mundane but crucial questions, such as who might benefit from stimulation, how much improvement can be made for certain symptoms and whether the therapy causes any extra trouble for some people. “This type of technology will go from a very exciting proof of concept to standard clinical care,” Seáñez predicts.</p>



<p>Over his nearly 30 years of living with a spinal cord injury, Chernesky has witnessed enough so-called scientific breakthroughs to be skeptical. He’s immune to hype. But he admits that he’s excited by this moment. “Because now we can reverse paralysis,” he says. That doesn’t mean people are going to suddenly be tap dancing like Fred Astaire or playing a Chopin concerto anytime soon, he’s quick to add. “But every little bit matters.”</p>



<p>Roccati, for one, no longer has to recruit friends to carry him in his wheelchair up stairs to socialize. He feels more energetic. He is working on his summer six-pack abs. He has transformed, again, into someone new. “Now, after the implant, I am another type of person,” he says, a more optimistic version of himself.</p>

<p>This technology is still a long way from helping everyone who might benefit. Still, these stimulators hold great promise. “I am quite hopeful, almost certain, that these devices are going to become available, and there will be a lot of people buying them,” Chernesky says. “When you have nothing, and you can get a little bit back — how good is that?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lionfish-slow-fast-prey-predator-patience">How slow and steady lionfish win the race against fast prey</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lionfish certainly aren’t the fastest predators on the reef, but new research suggests that they can catch swift prey through pure tenacity, gliding slowly in pursuit until the perfect moment to strike.</p>



<p>The finding may help explain part of the lionfish’s impact as an invasive species, and reveal a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.1085">key hunting strategy that other relatively slow predators use</a>, researchers report August 2 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Festooned with long striped spines, lionfish can make their surreal silhouettes disappear against a coral reef backdrop long enough to stalk and ambush small fish. But the predators also feed in open water where they’re more visible.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Curious about how the predators hunt in plain view, Ashley Peterson, a comparative biomechanist at the University of California, Irvine, and her colleagues placed red lionfish (<em>Pterois volitans</em>) in a tank and recorded them as they chased down a green chromis (<em>Chromis viridis</em>), a small reef fish.</p>



<p>In 14 of the 23 trials, the lionfish successfully gulped down their prey. They also had a high rate of strike success, capturing the chromis in 74 percent of the trials where the lionfish made a strike attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, the chromis swam about twice as fast as the lionfish. But many still fell victim to what Peterson and biomechanist Matthew McHenry, also at the University of California, Irvine, call a persistent-predation strategy — the lionfish swim toward a chromis, aiming for its current position, not the direction to intercept its path. And the lionfish’s pursuit is steady and incessant, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If they’re interested in something and they want to try to eat it, they just seem to not give up,” Peterson says. </p>



<p>In contrast, the prey fish does bursts of fast swimming along with short pauses.</p>



<p>“Over time, all those pauses add up and allow this lionfish to get closer and closer and closer,” Peterson says. Then the slightest mistake or bit of distraction can doom the prey to the lionfish’s suction-creating jaws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a good example of ‘slow and steady wins the race,’” says Bridie Allan, a marine ecologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand who was not involved in the research. It would be interesting to see how the unwavering chase plays out in the wild, where there are no spatial restrictions like in a tank, she says.</p>



<p>If lionfish do use the strategy in the wild and prey react similarly, it’s possible that the tactic could contribute to the destructive potential of their invasion in the Caribbean, Western Atlantic and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/lionfish-invasion-comes-mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, where the fish are devouring native ocean animals and disrupting food webs (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/6/16</em>)<em>. </em>But other factors, such as the lionfish’s huge appetite or prolific reproduction, could be more influential on invasiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The persistent-predation strategy may not be exclusive to lionfish, Peterson says. Other predatory fish groups with sluggish swimmers — like straw-shaped trumpetfish (<em>Aulostomus </em>spp.) — could also use it.</p>



<p>In a natural setting, prey that are dodging lionfish and other slow swimmers may have more places to hide, Peterson says. But there are inherent risks in a busy, distracting environment too. “If you’re near a reef or up against the coral, you could get pinned if you aren’t really paying attention,” she says.&nbsp;That’s when determined and hungry slowpokes may have the upper hand.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-merge-distant-spin-gravitational-wave">Two black holes merged despite being born far apart in space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signals buried deep in data from gravitational wave observatories imply a collision of two black holes that were clearly born in different places.</p>



<p>Almost all <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">the spacetime ripples</a> that experiments like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, see come from collisions among black holes and neutron stars that are probably close family members (<em>SN: 1/21/21</em>). They were once pairs of stars born at the same time and in the same place, eventually collapsing to form orbiting black holes or neutron stars in old age.</p>





<p>Now, a newly noted marriage of black holes, found in existing data from U.S.–based LIGO and its sister observatory Virgo in Italy, seems to be of an unrelated pair. Evidence for this stems from <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/accepted/b6076Q10C731f32896cb13a2ef3fb4619e92f5e48">how they were spinning as they merged into one</a>, researchers report in a paper in press at <em>Physical Review D</em>. Black holes that are born in the same place tend to have their spins aligned, like a pair of toy tops spinning on a table, as they orbit each other. But the pair in this case have no correlation between their respective spins and orbits, implying that they were born in different places.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is telling us we&#8217;ve finally found a pair of black holes that must come from the non-grow-old-and-die-together channel,&#8221; says Seth Olsen, a physicist at Princeton University.</p>



<p>Previous events that have turned up in gravitational wave observations show back holes merging that aren&#8217;t perfectly aligned, but most are close enough to strongly imply family connections. The new detection, which Olsen and colleagues found by sifting through data that the LIGO-Virgo collaboration released to the public, is different. One of the black holes is effectively spinning upside down.</p>



<p>That can&#8217;t easily happen unless the two black holes come from separate places. They probably met late in their stellar lives, unlike the black hole littermates that seem to make up the bulk of gravitational wave observations.</p>



<p>In addition to the merger between unrelated black holes, Olsen and his collaborators identified nine other black hole mergers that had slipped through the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">prior LIGO-Virgo studies</a> (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>“This is actually the nice thing about this type of analysis,” says LIGO scientific collaboration spokesperson Patrick Brady, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee who was not affiliated with the new study. “We deliver the data in a format that can be used by other people and then [they] will have access to try out new techniques.”</p>



<p>To compile so many new signals in data that had already been gone over by other researchers, Olsen&#8217;s group lowered the analytical bar a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;Out of the 10 new ones,&#8221; Olsen says, &#8220;there are about three of them, statistically, that probably come from noise,&#8221; rather than being definitive black hole merger detections. Assuming that the merger of black holes strangers is not among the errant signals, it almost certainly tells a tale of black hole histories distinct from the others seen so far.</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be [extremely] unlikely for this to come from two black holes that have been together for their whole lifespan,&#8221; Olsen says. &#8220;This must have been a capture. That&#8217;s cool because we&#8217;re finally able to start probing that region of the [black hole] population.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brady notes that “we don’t understand the theory [of black hole mergers] well enough to be able to confidently predict all of these types of things.” But the recent study may point to new and interesting opportunities in gravitational wave astronomy. “Let’s follow this clue to see if it really is reflecting something rare,” he says. “Or if not, well, we’ll learn other things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/friendships-rich-people-children-poverty">Friendships with rich people may help lift children out of poverty</a></h4>

              
                <p>Relationships can have a profound influence on a life, from the schools that people attend to the jobs they land. But teasing out how those connections impact a person’s economic status is tricky. Now, an analysis of billions of Facebook connections suggests that childhood <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04996-4">friendships between wealthier and poorer</a> individuals is linked to increased earnings later in life for poor children, researchers report online August 1 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>The study uses big data to explain long-standing research showing that a poor child’s loose social connections, such as to mentors or their wealthier friends’ parents, can help lift that child out of poverty, says Xi Song, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with this research.</p>





<p>“For people you know very well, with whom you have strong ties, you have very similar resources or social statuses,” Song says. “But what will really help you find a job, say … are those with a weak tie to you.” That’s because people outside a child’s immediate orbit can show them options for the future they may otherwise never consider, such as attending college or certain career tracks.</p>



<p>In the study, economist Raj Chetty of Harvard University and colleagues used data on roughly 72 million Facebook users ages 25 to 44 in the United States. If a relatively poor child lives where they can make roughly the same number of rich friends as the average rich child in the United States, that poor child’s adult income would be 20 percent higher on average than would be expected without that network, the team found.</p>



<p>Those friendships across class — what the researchers call economic connectedness — are “one of the strongest predictors of economic mobility that anyone has identified to date,” Chetty said in a July 28 news conference.</p>



<p>The researchers studied other measures of social capital, or the value of one’s relationships, including what the researchers call cohesiveness, or how tight-knit a friendship network was, and civic engagement such as volunteering, which indicated one’s involvement in community groups.</p>



<p>All three measures of social capital are important for different life outcomes, the team notes. For instance, high cohesiveness is linked to higher life expectancy. But only economic connectedness showed a link to higher-than-expected earnings.</p>



<p>The team gauged socioeconomic status by looking at the average income in a Facebook user’s residential neighborhood and self-reported educational attainment. Individuals were then divided into below-median and above-median income groups.</p>



<p>The researchers also identified the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04997-3">drivers of economic connectedness</a>, dubbed “exposure” and “friending bias,” in a second study in <em>Nature</em>. Exposure refers to the average number of wealthy people that a poor person comes into contact with in their daily lives, such as at school, work or a religious organization. Friending bias refers to the rate at which poor people befriend wealthier individuals within those social spheres. High friending bias can arise from both people’s desire to hang out with others like themselves and structural barriers, such as tracking in schools, Chetty noted.</p>



<p>Roughly half of the social disconnect in the United States arises from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/military-towns-integration-segregation-united-states">lack of exposure, or segregation</a>, the researchers found (<em>SN: 2/8/22</em>). Surprisingly, the other half arises from friending bias. In other words, policies aimed at increasing exposure alone, such as busing children to certain schools or affirmative action policies, are insufficient to facilitate economic connectedness, the team concludes.</p>



<p>So much effort in the United States, and even Chetty’s own group, has gone toward <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01843-4">intensive efforts to integrate groups</a>, says Bruce Sacerdote, an economist at Dartmouth University who cowrote a perspective in <em>Nature</em> on the studies. This work suggests that “there may be simpler, lower cost things you can do to increase connectedness without, say, moving your entire family.”</p>



<p>For instance, Lake Highlands High School in Texas has roughly the same percentage of students from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds but high friending bias. Administrators and students recently identified the school’s architecture as a culprit. That is, the school houses three cafeterias, which caused students to sort themselves into the “appropriate” lunchroom based on social cliques. Architects are now working to create a single lunchroom for everyone to mix together along with more spaces for students to interact. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the new research, the team released a <a href="https://www.socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&amp;dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&amp;dim2=CohesivenessClustering&amp;dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&amp;geoLevel=county&amp;selectedId=06037">public dataset</a> that allows users to gauge the level of connections between rich and poor people for every county, ZIP code, high school and college in the United States. The team hopes that policy makers and school administrators can use this dataset to identify the sorts of class integration policies that will work best given local conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smaller datasets exist to measure social capital, says sociologist Brian Levy of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. “The ability to quantify the overall effect across the nation is unique.”</p>



<p>Building these connections — even after childhood ends — is key to reducing friendship bias and improving economic outcomes for poorer people across the country, the researchers emphasize. As an example of the type of new program that’s needed, they point to a nonprofit called Inner City Weightlifting, headquartered in Dorchester, Mass., whose mission is&nbsp; connecting people from different social worlds. The nonprofit trains people from impoverished backgrounds as personal gym trainers and then connects them to more well-heeled clientele.</p>



<p>“Generally trainers and clients become friends,” says the company’s founder and CEO Jon Feinman. He has seen clients vouch for their trainers in court or pay for their kids to attend expensive summer camps.</p>



<p>Bobby Fullard, 30, is a trainer with the nonprofit. He remembers a day a couple of years ago when a white client at his gym messaged him on Instagram to ask if he would run with her on a Saturday. Fullard, who is Black and sports tattoos and dreadlocks, agreed reluctantly.</p>



<p>“The most uncomfortable thing to me is talking to a white woman. I just don’t think they are ever going to understand my world,” says Fullard, who spent his teens and 20s in and out of jail. But he agreed to the run.</p>



<p>When Fullard showed up, the woman had brought along a friend, another white woman. Fullard was doubly anxious. “I’m saying two words every time I speak,” he recalls. But the client helped him feel comfortable, and the trio have been running together regularly ever since.</p>



<p>More recently, Fullard realized what he really wanted to be is a carpenter. So he launched his own carpentry business. Among his first clients? Those two running partners, he says.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whale-sharkf-fish-largest-omnivore-skin-meat-plants">Whale sharks may be the world’s largest omnivores</a></h4>

              
                <p>As Mark Meekan bobbed among swells in the Indian Ocean, he spotted a giant shadowy figure moving through the water. The tropical fish biologist dove to meet the gentle giant&nbsp; — a whale shark — and took some samples of its skin. Swimming alongside these aquatic giants is nothing new for Meekan, who works at the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Perth. But “having an encounter with something that feels like it’s from prehistory is an experience that never gets old,” he says.</p>



<p>Averaging around 12 meters long, the whale shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) is the largest living fish species on Earth and among the most mysterious. Since these sharks spend the majority of their lives in the deep ocean, Meekan says, analyzing the chemical makeup of their tissues can be hugely powerful for learning more about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-war-nuclear-test-residue-offers-clue-whale-shark-ages">the animals’ fundamental biology</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>) and behavior — including what they like to eat.<br><br>The skin samples that Meekan and colleagues collected and analyzed reveal that whale sharks, long thought to be strict meat-eaters, also eat and digest algae. The findings, described July 19 in <em>Ecology</em>, add to a growing body of evidence that whale sharks deliberately eat plants, making them <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3818">the largest omnivores on Earth</a>. The previous record-holder, the Kodiak brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos middendorffi</em>), averages about 2.5 meters in length.</p>





<p>Algae has turned up before in the stomachs of beached whale sharks. But because of how whale sharks feed — by swimming mouth-open through swarms of zooplankton — “everyone though it was just accidental ingestion,” Meekan says. Carnivores typically can’t digest plant life, so some scientists suspected that algae passed through whale sharks’ guts without being digested.</p>



<p>To find out if that assumption held up, Meekan and colleagues followed whale sharks as the fish gathered near Ningaloo reef off the coast of Western Australia in 2017. Since the gigantic fish are well camouflaged from the sea surface, the team located 17 individuals that had surfaced to feed from an airplane. They then intercepted the sharks by boat and jumped into the water to snap pictures, scrape off parasites and collect tissue samples.</p>



<p>Meekan says most whale sharks don’t react when they get jabbed by the spear, which is roughly the width of a pinky finger. Some even seem to enjoy attention from researchers, he says. It’s as though they think: “This isn’t threatening. In fact, I quite like that.”</p>



<p>The whale sharks at Ningaloo reef were rich in arachidonic acid, an organic molecule found in brown algae called sargassum, the analysis showed. Since the sharks can’t make this molecule themselves, they probably got it by digesting algae, Meekan says. It’s not yet clear how arachidonic acid affects whale sharks.<br><br>The new work supports previous research by an independent group that <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecm.1339">found plant nutrients</a> in the skin of whale sharks off the coast of Japan. Taken together, the findings suggest that digesting greens is common practice for whale sharks.   </p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that whale sharks are true omnivores, says shark biologist Robert Hueter of Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida. “Whale sharks take in a lot of other things than the food they’re targeting,” he says. “This is a bit like saying that cows are omnivores because they eat insects while feeding on grass.”</p>



<p>While Meekan admits that he can’t say for certain that whale sharks specifically seek out sargassum, the amount they eat isn’t incidental either. His team’s analysis clearly shows, he says, that plant material in fact makes up a very large part of their diet. It’s so large, he notes, that whale sharks and the zooplankton that they also eat seem to occupy similar rungs on the marine food chain, both just one rung above the phytoplankton they both feast upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether whale sharks actively seek out plant snacks, the animals do have the ability to digest them, Meekan says. “We don’t see whale sharks that often, but their tissues hold a remarkable record of what they’ve been up to,” he says. “We’re now learning how to read this library.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-amoeba-move-faster-carry-cargo-trucks-microbes-disease">Tiny amoebas move faster when carrying cargo than without</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microbes enlisted to carry tiny loads travel faster with cargo attached than on their own.</p>



<p>That’s the surprising finding of a study of the carrying capacity of single-cell amoebas. The microbes serve as prototypes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2020#shapiro">microscopic “trucks</a>” for delivering drugs to precisely target disease inside the human body or moving material for minuscule construction projects (<em>SN: 9/30/20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers tested the cargo capacity of the amoeba <em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em> with styrene balls ranging in size from 10 microns, roughly as big as a red blood cell, up to 90 microns. The balls spontaneously stuck to the backs of the microbes, which are themselves only about 10 microns across.</p>





<p>On their own, the amoebas meander about. With a small styrene ball stuck to them, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/accepted/59072KbdUb01610b551a94e3f2fac3d2e82991262">they move faster</a>, the researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review Applied</em>. The team can’t say precisely what the optimum carrying capacity of the amoebas is, but they achieved their highest speeds with cargo between 30 and 60 microns in diameter — an impressive load for the tiny microbes.</p>



<p>“To us this was surprising,” says biophysicist Carsten Beta of the University of Potsdam in Germany. The researchers’ intuition was that the microbes would move more slowly with cargo than without, “and that their spreading efficiency would [continuously] decrease with increasing cargo size,” he says.</p>



<p>Beta and his team also found that the microbes moved the balls along in bursts that increased in length for increasingly large balls. But the larger the ball, the less frequently the amoebas moved it at all. This combination of effects ensures that there’s a sweet spot that will be best for cellular trucks, as Beta calls them, with comparatively large steps occurring frequently enough to speed the trucks on their way to dropping off medicine or microscopic building materials.</p>



<p>“In the end, this will not be done with <em>Dictyostelium</em> cells but with amoeboid cells that are intrinsically present in the human body,” such as white blood cells, Beta says. Meanwhile, the amoebas make handy laboratory analogs.</p>



<p>“These results are insightful,” says Virginia Tech mechanical engineer Bahareh Behkam, who studies cell-based microrobots but was not part of the study. “It would be interesting to see how they may change if the particle properties change.”</p>



<p>That’s what Beta hopes to do next by investigating how the microbes fare carrying shapes other than spheres. He also plans to direct the amoebas’ motions, perhaps by luring them with chemical trails, rather than letting them wander about at random. Both issues will be important for making sure useful cargo ends up in the right places.</p>



<p>“Biohybrid systems, such as the one described in this work … will be safe, intelligent and can act as cellular surgeons accessing the currently inaccessible areas of the human body safely and facilitating targeted therapy,” Behkam says.</p>

How do we relate specific neural states to aspects of a changeable self? In a field increasingly focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics" target="_blank" title="opto- chemo- magnetogenetics">remote control</a> of genetically-defined microciruits, pinning down subjective internal phenomena seems presumptuous and hopelessly overambitious. <br /></p><p>But of course, the inherent challenge of studying complex subjective experiences hasn't stopped scientists from trying. One active area of research involves characterizing the neural correlates of internal responses to traumatic events. This is of great clinical relevance, because the long-term persistence of fear, hypervigilance, negative affect, and intrusive memories after trauma can be disabling (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/box/part1_ch3.box16/" target="_blank">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, PTSD). Alterations in one's sense of self (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/box/part1_ch3.box16/" target="_blank">dissociation</a>) can also occur in PTSD, and is the focus of the rest of this post. Dissociative symptoms can include:<br /></p><ol><li class="half_rhythm"><div><b>Depersonalization:</b> Persistent or  recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an  outside observer of, one’s mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as  though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body  or of time moving slowly).</div><div>&nbsp;</div></li><li class="half_rhythm"><div><b>Derealization:</b> Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g.,  the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike,  distant, or distorted).&nbsp;</div></li></ol><p></p><p><br />In states of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder" target="_blank">depersonalization/derealization</a> (which can occur independently of PTSD), one feels disconnected from the self and/or external reality. Dissociative symptoms are considered a <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.21090911" target="_blank">maladaptive</a> (but protective) response to stress and trauma. The standard method of eliciting dissociative symptoms during fMRI scanning is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322302013677" target="_blank">script-driven imagery</a> (SDI), a highly unpleasant manipulation. Before the experiment, the participant recounts a narrative of the traumatic event, which is subsequently read back to them in the scanner. The presence of acute dissociative symptoms is determined by questionnaires and interviews before, during, and after the scan. <br /></p><p>Early studies reported increased activity in prefrontal (and other) cortical regions in the SDI condition compared to baseline (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322302013677" target="_blank">Lanius et al., 2002</a>) or a neutral script condition (<a href="https://www.blogger.com/#" target="_blank">Hopper et al., 2007</a>), which was related to the severity of dissociative symptoms. This fits a theoretical perspective where higher cortical regions are tamping down limbic (and emotional) responses to the trauma induction. It should be mentioned that dissociative responses to SDI are generally less common than vivid re-experiencing of the trauma (30% vs. 70% in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322302013677" target="_blank">Lanius et al., 2002</a>). Drawbacks of these studies include small samples sizes and inconsistencies in the fMRI results.<br /></p><p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/neural-correlates-of-acute-posttraumatic-dissociation-a-functional-neuroimaging-scriptdriven-imagery-study/C8ED458373AF5C3E71D740CB078258D1" target="_blank">Mertens and colleagues</a> (2022) set out to replicate these findings in a larger, more homogeneous population of 51 female survivors of childhood abuse. The study included additional questionnaires and separation of the SDI condition into “script listening” and “focused recall” phases (previous studies only included the latter). The experimental design included three runs of neutral script (30 sec each of listening/imaging and focused recall of the event) and three runs of trauma script, which was effective in increasing self-reported ratings of dissociative symptoms, e.g. “<i>Did what you were experiencing seem unreal to you, like you were in a dream or watching a movie or play?</i>” and “<i>Did you feel like you were a spectator watching what was happening to you, like an observer or outsider?</i>” (rated on a 0-6 scale).<br /></p><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><span><span style="font-family: arial;"><span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">–</span></span> click on image for a larger view </span></span></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"><b><span><span style="font-family: arial;"><span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">–</span></span></span></span></b></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></b><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxeWHnthyDCmx8QZoDj19mW5W0VtujXpBl5pUNQmmB1VIv818BCdTaPOaWu_9c2ubSOi6iasNKzwjyGs-42GusqEj7wMqAImO6G20CqHhoPKt9aRZBUQwaC0IYCXHROY06osxwPRsJx8XVaYWd0NN0rjj39Joj7pU3Vk-dwQPfslQrFA669Q/s1080/Mertens_fig1_.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="362" data-original-width="1080" height="136" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxeWHnthyDCmx8QZoDj19mW5W0VtujXpBl5pUNQmmB1VIv818BCdTaPOaWu_9c2ubSOi6iasNKzwjyGs-42GusqEj7wMqAImO6G20CqHhoPKt9aRZBUQwaC0IYCXHROY06osxwPRsJx8XVaYWd0NN0rjj39Joj7pU3Vk-dwQPfslQrFA669Q/w400-h134/Mertens_fig1_.png" width="425" /></a></div><br /><p>The fMRI results indicated that a wide swath of left cerebellum, occipital cortex, and supramarginal gyrus (parietal lobe) were more active in the trauma script than neutral condition, and this was specific to the script listening phase (no differences were observed during the focused recall phase).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">I think I have long COVID. What does that mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the year before the omicron variant began to spread in the United States, an estimated one-third of 18- to 45-year-olds had gotten sick with COVID-19. Just three months later, that figure doubled, and I was among the people who caught the coronavirus for the first time.</p>



<p>I was in the first wave of people who got omicron in December 2021, as I was finishing my fall semester at Cornell University. On the day I received my positive test result, I knew it was coming. I had a sore throat, cough and my whole body ached. For the next several days, I was so tired that I had to sleep for more than half the day while trying to finish my final exams and help report on the outbreak for my college daily newspaper. Days later, after taking every vitamin, supplement and over-the-counter medicine I could get, I tried to get back to my normal routine, starting with a workout on Zoom. I found myself needing to stop every couple of minutes to catch my breath.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time passed. I began to exhaust the list of YouTube workouts, and I began to feel better, but I never really got to 100 percent. Six months later, my friends and family no longer asked: “Do you feel any better?” In some ways I do. But between feeling much more out of breath every time I go to exercise than I used to or often hitting a wall at 3 p.m., I’ve wondered: Am I among the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm">estimated 1 in 5 people</a> in the United States who have long COVID?</p>



<p>What initially seems like a simple question is actually much more complicated than yes or no. There is no biological test — no swab or blood test — to say that someone has long COVID. Doctors and public health organizations don’t have a universal definition of the condition.</p>



<h4>Putting a name to it</h4>



<p>While the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it">given the name COVID-19</a> in February 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/elisaperego78/status/1263172084055838721?s=20">long COVID surfaced a few months later as a hashtag</a> on Twitter when Elisa Perego began using the term in her tweets. The archaeology researcher who has become a long COVID advocate, first fell ill in late winter of 2020 in Lombardy, Italy. Three months later, she relapsed —&nbsp;her blood oxygen levels began to drop again, and she may have had a small blood clot in her lungs. This was not the same COVID-19 that Perego was seeing on the news.</p>



<p>“For me, the idea of long COVID was about reframing COVID,” she told me over e-mail because of ongoing symptoms that make it difficult to talk for long periods of time. The term not only gave her experiences a name but began to unite what was a growing group of those who had COVID-19 and couldn’t seem to shake the aftereffects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Very prolonged positive tests were being talked about in Italy. A grassroots movement of people who weren&#8217;t recovering from COVID was burgeoning on Twitter and other media,” she says. “So I thought the hashtag and the name long COVID could be a way to link this growing community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, other terms have also been used: post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection, or PASC, post-acute COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html">post-COVID conditions</a>. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses that last one, writing broadly “post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that people experience after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.”</p>



<p>The only clear distinction that health professionals seem to agree on when it comes to long COVID is that it is the emergence or change of symptoms some time after being infected with the coronavirus. But how long after and what those symptoms are aren’t universally agreed upon.</p>



<p>Right now, that may be for the best, experts say.</p>



<p>A broad definition helps people with long COVID recognize that they have it and receive the care they need, says neuroscientist David Putrino at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It also helps people from historically excluded groups who have long COVID get a proper diagnosis, when they may have otherwise been written off and labeled as psychosomatic.</p>



<p>Yet, even with a broad definition, people might not know they have it. While recently recruiting for a long COVID clinical trial, Putrino found that about half of the people that reported they had “fully recovered” failed his screening for post-COVID conditions because they still had lingering symptoms.</p>



<p>Many of these people fall into a similar camp as I do: They are not debilitated but they are “slowed down.” And similar to me, Putrino says, many of them say that they have fully recovered but have one symptom that doesn’t seem to go away —&nbsp;like having trouble exercising or needing to go to sleep much earlier than they used to or noticing they need an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>





<h4>When COVID-19 becomes long COVID</h4>



<p>A key question in knowing who has long COVID is defining when acute COVID ends and long COVID begins. And there is disagreement there, too. The CDC starts its clock for long COVID at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html">four weeks post-infection</a>, while the World Health Organization says <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Post_COVID-19_condition-Clinical_case_definition-2021.1">it’s closer to 12 weeks</a>. The National Institutes of Health, in <a href="https://recovercovid.org/long-covid">recruiting for its initiative to study long COVID</a>, defines “post-acute” as starting 30 days after infection for children but does not define the window for adults.</p>



<p>There’s risk in making the time too short or too long. Too short, and doctors may include people that are just having a particularly long bout of acute COVID. They are likely to recover regardless of treatment, so including them makes it difficult to determine if a long COVID treatment is effective. For his work, Putrino is firmly in “team WHO” because he says that there are people that are still dealing with the acute symptoms of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 four weeks in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do not want to propagate the narrative that a certain percentage of long COVID patients spontaneously recover,” he says. “That&#8217;s not the case. I think that the individuals who are sick at four weeks who then go on to recover without doing anything interventional were just individuals who were still sick with COVID and ultimately recovered.”</p>



<p>However, if the start point is too far off, it will delay people getting care.</p>



<p>This is why Perego leans toward the four-week timeframe so that people can seek care sooner. But she says that researchers may want to track changes in a person’s condition over longer periods of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Clinically, my hope would be to have support as early as possible. The timing of the disease development might change in different patients,” she says. “There might be changes into how the disease develops with vaccination and the new variants. But I don&#8217;t like the idea of letting people with no in-depth care to wait for the moment they match a specific clinical case definition, which might be an artificial construct and quite delayed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a lot of ways, defining long COVID is like trying to hit a moving target but better understanding how long COVID changes over time will help researchers “figure out exactly what it is and maybe what it isn&#8217;t,” says Josh Fessel, a senior clinical advisor at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a part of the National Institutes of Health. Aside from tracking timing, another way to do that is tracking symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Symptoms of long COVID</h4>



<p>I had what all of the experts I talked with see as the most common symptoms —&nbsp;fatigue and shortness of breath. But others have trouble <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-fog-coronavirus-immune-response-fatigue">thinking or concentrating</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html">a pounding heart, joint or muscle aches</a> to name a few (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). While this long list of potential symptoms casts as wide a net as possible, it also creates a “diagnosis of exclusion,” says Emily Pfaff, a clinical informaticist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In order for patients to know they have long COVID, they must first prove that their symptoms don’t have other causes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That is an effort to ensure that we&#8217;re not confusing long COVID with other stuff, but what that can do is sort of put patients on this kind of diagnostic odyssey where they&#8217;re trying to match up their symptoms and their physicians and providers are trying to match them up with various diseases only to rule those out in order to say ‘Yes, maybe this is long COVID,’” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes ruling conditions out and homing in on long COVID difficult is that long COVID has flavors; it doesn’t come with the same symptoms, and it may not be caused by the same thing in everyone who has it. “​​We envision that long COVID has at least seven different mechanisms,” says Joan Soriano, a medical epidemiologist who helped WHO write its definition of long COVID. “This is similar to chronic fatigue syndrome or post-intensive care unit syndrome. Accordingly, any definition of long COVID will not be simple.”</p>



<p>A definition of long COVID has to encompass people who may still have virus circulating in their bodies, those who may have had autoimmune issues following infection, still others who have microclots in their blood and maybe people like me with a nagging feeling of not being quite back to normal. As researchers try to understand long COVID, and how to treat it, they will need to differentiate between these different flavors, called endotypes, Putrino says. Different flavors will call for different treatments. Something like an antiviral will probably work only for those people whose long COVID symptoms are caused by viral persistence. A blood thinner wouldn’t work for them but could help those with microclots.</p>



<p>One thing that could help with grouping the flavors of long COVID and recognizing how symptoms persist in large groups of patients is artificial intelligence, Soriano says. This is the type of work Pfaff, at UNC, is currently doing. She is creating a machine learning algorithm that can look at a patient’s health records and predict if they will have long COVID. “It’s never going to be 100 percent,” she says. But her algorithm is beginning to be able to accurately predict who will have it, and she is beginning to use it to figure out what flavor they might have.</p>



<p>Data, however, can’t operate in a vacuum, she says. Researchers need information from people like me and many others to get a firm grasp on what long COVID is and how to treat it. Merging hospital data with survey data from patients is the only way forward on creating a definition, Pfaff says.</p>



<p>I’m still not sure where I stand with my own case. A couple of weeks ago, I felt sheepish even mentioning that having long COVID was something that was on my mind. Long COVID is not something that really comes up in my everyday conversations, especially as an active 22-year-old. That quickly changed when Putrino, unprompted, described a class of people who just can’t get back to working out, or need an extra cup of coffee to keep up with their pre-COVID pace. This described how I have felt for months to a tee. Putrino, Pfaff and Fessel agreed that I fall into what is generally a pretty large group of people with long COVID, and Fessel told me he wouldn’t bat an eye if I were to apply to enroll in the NIH’s clinical trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, I struggled to use the term. I haven’t been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-long-covid-worsening-the-labor-shortage/">put out of work</a> as Perego and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-long-covid-worsening-the-labor-shortage/">hundreds of thousands of others have</a>. Despite my aversion to saying I have long COVID because it has disrupted the lives of so many more than it has my own, defining the broad spectrum of experiences it’s led to may be important. Until we have reliable tests for the condition, what matters is people sharing their individual experiences.</p>

                <p>The small motorboat anchors in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. Shrieks of wintering birds assault the vessel’s five crew members, all clad in bright orange flotation suits. One of the crew slowly pulls a rope out of the water to retrieve a plastic tube, about the length of a person’s arm and filled with mud from the bottom of the bay. As the tube is hauled on board, the stench of rotten eggs fills the air.</p>



<p>“Chesapeake Bay mud is stinky,” says Sairah Malkin, a biogeochemist at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge who is aboard the boat. The smell comes from sulfuric chemicals called sulfides within the mud. They’re quite toxic, Malkin explains.</p>



<p>Malkin and her team venture out onto the bay every couple of months to sample the foul muck and track the abundance of squiggling mud dwellers called cable bacteria. The microbes are living wires: Their threadlike bodies — thinner than a human hair — can channel electricity.</p>

<p>Cable bacteria use that power to chemically rewire their surroundings. While some microbes in the area produce sulfides, the cable bacteria remove those chemicals and help prevent them from moving up into the water column. By managing sulfides, cable bacteria may protect fish, crustaceans and other aquatic organisms from a “toxic nightmare,” says Filip Meysman, a biogeochemist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. “They’re kind of like guardian angels in these coastal ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Now, scientists are studying how these living electrical filaments might do good in other ways. Laboratory experiments show that cable bacteria can support other microbes that consume crude oil, so researchers are investigating how to encourage the bacteria’s growth to help clean up oil spills. What’s more, researchers have shown that cable bacteria could help slash emissions of a potent greenhouse gas — methane — into the atmosphere.</p>





<p>There’s plenty of evidence that cable bacteria exert a strong influence over their microbial neighbors, Meysman says. The next step, he says, is to figure out how to channel that influence for the greater good.</p>





<h4>Electric life</h4>



<p>Under the microscope, cable bacteria resemble long sausage links. Their multicellular bodies can grow up to 5 centimeters long. Embedded in the envelope of each cell are parallel “wires” of conductive proteins, which the bacteria use to channel electrons. According to Meysman, the wires are more conductive than the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24312-4">semi­conductors found in electronics</a>.</p>



<p>About a decade ago, a team of scientists first discovered cable bacteria, in sediment collected from the bottom of Denmark’s Aarhus Bay. Since then, cable bacteria have been found on at least four continents, in streams, lakes, estuaries and coastal environments. “Name me a country, and I’ll show you where the cable bacteria are,” Meysman says.</p>



<p>Most often, cable bacteria nestle shallow in the sediment, with one end positioned near the surface where there is oxygen and the other end plugged into deeper, sulfide-rich zones. Using their filamentous bodies as electrical conduits, cable bacteria snatch electrons from sulfides on one end and off-load them to oxygen — an eager electron acceptor — at the other, says Nicole Geerlings, a biogeochemist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Similar to how batteries charge and release energy by transferring electrons between an anode and cathode, cable bacteria power themselves by channeling electrons, she says. “The electron transport gives [cable bacteria] energy.”</p>



<p>This unique lifestyle allows cable bacteria to survive in an environment that many organisms could not endure.</p>

<h4>Toxic fire wall</h4>



<p>In 2015, Malkin, Meysman and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510152112">cable bacteria may help to counteract the onset of euxinia</a> — a fatal buildup of sulfides in oxygen-starved bodies of water. Euxinia can trigger mass die-offs of fish, crustaceans and other aquatic life.</p>



<p>The lethal phenomenon can occur after fertilizers or sewage are washed into the sea or lakes. That flow of nutrients can trigger algal blooms. When those nutrients are depleted, the blooms die, and large quantities of organic matter sink and accumulate on the sediment. Microbes then decompose the dead material, devouring much of the oxygen in the surrounding water in the process. When oxygen levels become critically low, sulfides may begin to leak from the sediment into the water, giving rise to euxinia.</p>

<p>While studying cable bacteria in a brackish body of water in the Netherlands, Malkin and colleagues discovered a thin layer of rust coating the lake’s bottom. As the cable bacteria pulled electrons from sulfides, converting the noxious chemicals into less-harmful sulfates, the water within the sediment became more acidic, which dissolved some minerals containing iron. The now-mobile iron percolated upward in the sediment, until it interacted with oxygen to form rust.</p>



<p>This layer of rust could capture sulfides that would otherwise flow into the water, acting as a “fire wall” that could delay euxinia for over a month, or even prevent it altogether, the researchers reported. Even when the cable bacteria’s population dropped, the rust layer persisted, protecting other aquatic creatures from sulfide exposure. The rust may explain why even though instances of nutrient pollution, algal blooms and oxygen depletion are relatively common, reports of euxinia are rare.</p>



<h4>Oil cleanup</h4>



<p>Some researchers are trying to harness the bacteria’s electrical abilities to tackle another devastating threat to coastal ecosystems — oil spills.</p>



<p>When an oil spill happens in a body of water, booms, skimmers or sorbents are often deployed to limit the spread of hydrocarbons on the surface. But oil may also wash onto beaches, mix with sediments in shallow waters and aggregate onto sinking particles of organic debris, hitching a ride to the seafloor.</p>



<p>Cleaning up oil at the bottom of the sea is a difficult job, says Ugo Marzocchi, a biogeochemist at Aarhus University in Denmark. “I am not aware of a very effective way to remove hydrocarbons from the seafloor,” he says. “In inland freshwater systems, what is generally done is to dig out the sediments,” he says, an expensive strategy that would be even more costly at sea.</p>

</div><figcaption>Electrical cable bacteria (white filaments) emerge from the seafloor sediment (at bottom) stretching their bodies to reach a zone of oxygen in the water. The stringy organisms use the oxygen to offload electrons they’ve harvested from harmful sulfides found in the sediment. As sulfide concentrations go down, the water becomes more habitable to microbes that can clean up oil spills.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some soil-dwelling microorganisms can use hydrocarbons to fuel their metabolism, and researchers have been studying how some of these oil burners might assist in the cleanup of contaminated sediments. But as they break down hydrocarbons, the microbes generate those concerning sulfides, which are detrimental to the microbes’ own survival, Marzocchi says. In other words, the microbes can help clean up the oil for only so long before they’re overwhelmed by their own toxic waste.</p>



<p>Cable bacteria might be just the solution, Marzocchi thought. In 2016, researchers reported finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2015250">evidence of the electrical microbes in a tar oil-contaminated groundwater aquifer</a> in Germany. Knowing that cable bacteria could occupy sediments contaminated with hydrocarbons, Marzocchi and colleagues reasoned that these bacteria might be able to assist oil-burning microbes and accelerate oil cleanup.</p>



<p>The researchers filled several containers with oil-contaminated sediment from Aarhus Bay — which contained naturally occurring oil-eating bacteria. The group then injected a few containers with cable bacteria and monitored the degree of hydrocarbon degradation in all of the containers over seven weeks. By the end of the test, the concentration of alkanes — a type of hydrocarbon — in the sediment with cable bacteria had dropped from 0.125 milligrams per gram of sediment to 0.086 milligrams per gram — <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420300567#sec5">a 31 percent drop</a>. That’s 23 percentage points more than the 9 percent decrease in the control samples. Cable bacteria helped accelerate the metabolic activity of their oil-eating neighbors by converting the toxic sulfides into sulfates. The sulfates didn’t harm the oil-eating microbes — in fact, they used the chemicals as fuel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>To the rescue&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Oil-eating microbes can clean up seafloor sediments contaminated by an oil spill. But the microbes generate toxic sulfides as waste, which hampers the microbes’ activity. Cable bacteria can help by harvesting electrons from the sulfides, converting them into sulfates, which the oil-eating microbes use as fuel. Meanwhile, the cable bacteria channel the electrons up their bodies and pass them off to oxygen in the sediment. This transport powers the cable bacteria’s metabolism in the process.</p>

<p>The researchers are now trying to develop methods to promote cable bacteria growth in the field and see if it’s possible to enhance their effect on oil degradation. One catch is that in oil-contaminated sediment, oxygen is quickly used up by the microbes that break down hydrocarbons. That’s a problem since cable bacteria need access to oxygen. Salts that slowly release oxygen or nitrate — which cable bacteria can use in place of oxygen — might help spur the electrical organisms’ growth at oil spills. But more work is needed to identify the right chemical components and dosage, Marzocchi says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, scientists are investigating how cable bacteria might help reduce emission of another hydrocarbon — one that accumulates in the sky.</p>



<h4>Methane at the root</h4>



<p>Colorless, odorless <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/agriculture-fossil-fuels-are-driving-record-high-methane-emissions">methane is the simplest hydrocarbon</a> (<em>SN: 8/15/20, p. 8</em>). It consists of a single carbon atom attached to a quartet of hydrogen atoms. And it’s a potent greenhouse gas — more than 25 times as effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>One <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">major source of methane is rice paddies</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 16</em>). During the growing season, rice farmers typically flood their fields to help stave off weeds and pests. Methane-producing microbes — aptly named methanogens — thrive in these waterlogged soils. Paddy-dwelling methanogens are so prolific that rice fields are estimated to generate about 11 percent of all human-induced methane emissions.</p>



<p>But cable bacteria like paddies too. In 2019, Vincent Scholz, a microbiologist at Aarhus University, and colleagues reported that cable bacteria could <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/95/6/fiz062/5485638?login=false">flourish among the roots of rice plants</a> and several other aquatic plant species.</p>

Scholz/Aarhus Univ.</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That discovery inspired the researchers to investigate how the bacteria interact with methanogens in soils that grow rice. The team grew its own rice plants — some potted in soils with cable bacteria, and some without — and monitored methane emissions.</p>



<p>To the researchers’ surprise, adding cable bacteria <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15812-w#citeas">reduced rice soil methane emissions</a> by 93 percent. In the process of removing electrons from sulfides, the bacteria generate sulfates, which other microbes can use as fuel. These sulfate-consuming microbes outcompeted methanogens for nutrients such as hydrogen and acetate in the rice soils, the researchers found. The results were “quite amazing,” Scholz says, though the effectiveness of the electrical microbes in real rice fields has yet to be tested.</p>



<p>There are signs that cable bacteria are already plugged into real rice paddy soils. After analyzing genetic data collected from rice paddies in the United States, India, Vietnam and China, Scholz and colleagues reported in 2021 the <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17415">presence of cable bacteria at sites</a> in all four countries. Scholz is in Northern California this summer studying how cable bacteria live in rice fields and whether they’re already impacting methane emissions. He is also exploring ways to introduce cable bacteria to rice fields where they don’t yet exist or enhance the microbes’ numbers in fields where they do.</p>



<p>There is still much to discover about how the wispy electrical conductors influence our world, Malkin says. Back in the Chesapeake Bay, she and colleagues have found that cable bacteria tend to flourish in the spring, a surge that has also been observed in the Netherlands. The findings add to a growing body of work that suggests cable bacteria are opportunistic organisms that interact with their environments in similar ways all around the world.</p>



<p>If cable bacteria are already hard at work across the planet, then a bit of coaxing from researchers may be all it takes to turn the mud-dwelling creatures into the most helpful neighbors that a living thing could ask for.</p>

                <p>Astronauts might one day dine on salad grown in asteroid soil.</p>



<p>Romaine lettuce, chili pepper and pink radish plants <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac74c9">all grew in mixtures of peat moss and faux asteroid soil</a>, researchers report in the July <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-dirt-plants-farming-regolith">grown crops in lunar dirt</a> (<em>SN: 5/23/22</em>). But the new study focuses on “carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, known to be rich in volatile sources — water especially,” says astroecologist Sherry Fieber-Beyer of the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. These meteorites, and their parent asteroids, are also rich in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus — key agricultural nutrients. Pulverizing these types of asteroids, perhaps as part of space mining efforts, could potentially provide a ready supply of farming material in space.</p>





<p>Fieber-Beyer purchased a material that mimics the space rocks’ composition and gave it to her graduate student Steven Russell. “I said, ‘All right, grow me some plants.’”</p>



<p>Russell, now an astrobiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, chose a type of radish, lettuce and chili pepper — all of which have grown aboard the International Space Station. He, Fieber-Beyer and their colleague Kathryn Yurkonis, also of the University of North Dakota, compared how the plants grew in only faux asteroid soil, only peat moss and various mixes of the two.</p>



<p>Peat moss keeps soil loose and improves water retention. In all mixtures with peat moss, the plants grew. Faux asteroid soil on its own, however, compacted and couldn’t retain water, and so plants couldn’t grow.</p>



<p>Next, Fieber-Beyer will try growing hairy vetch seeds in that faux asteroid dirt, let the plants decay and then mix the dead plant matter throughout the soil. That, she says, could ensure that the soil doesn’t compact. Plus, seeds weigh a lot less than peat moss, making them easier to carry to space to help with any future farming attempts.</p>
